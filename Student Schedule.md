**LING 229 2024 Schedule**

This schedule maps the order notebooks should be reviewed/completed against the workshop dates. Please review the **A** notebooks before attending the workshops or watching the recordings. The **B*** notebooks are intended for self-study of Python concepts independent of the workshops. However, please feel free to ask about content from any notebook in the workshops or elsewhere.

Some notebooks will contain a link to readings from the [NLTK Book](https://www.nltk.org/book/). These notebooks repeat content from the book and also go into more detail / examples. You should refer to the NLTK book as you go through the relevant notebooks. 

Other notebooks will have links to free tutorials online - these are intended primarily as additional resources / practice.

basically go from bags of words to bags of meanings.
