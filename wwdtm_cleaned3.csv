Unfortunately, this phenomenon isn't anything new. A Stanford scholar recently published an article on one of the first betting scandals ever recorded in sports. In Scotland, where it is believed the earliest curling leagues were organized, a 16th century Scottish curling team, led by legendary Fergus Magnuson, became local heroes after a winning streak led them to a spot in the regional finals. However, after what seemed to be an embarrassing loss to their weaker Glasgow rivals, questions were raised. An investigation revealed that the entire team had thrown the match in exchange for a rather unusual bribe offered by a fanatic and extremely wealthy supporter of the other side.

""we started advertising that groningen really is the ugliest city in holland,"" said mayor van olmen, ""and that people should come and see for themselves just how unattractive our town really is.""   the few intrepid residents who remained pitched in with the uglification efforts. they put avocado green wall-to-wall shag carpeting in public buildings. they made everyone in town wear light blue denim shirts and dark blue denim pants.   all the men grew soul patches and mullets.   and just last week, they opened an olive garden franchise.    soon the town was a real crap hole, and curious tourists, they couldn't stay away. they have made more than enough money to repair the town, but are in a bit of a bind. said mayor von olmen, ""if we actually fix groningen, i'm not sure people will come. we could really use the money though. it's an interesting place to visit but nobody wants to live here anymore.""",2011,141,0.696551724,-0.6551,0.036885246,0.082333333,0.134,-0.9825,1.230747427,0.016393443,5.526666667,5.695882353,-0.8658,371.0056497,0.055555556,0.01171875,0.014925373,1.585925762,0.012295082,0.06147541,0.054794521,0.032786885,0.666666667,0.116471598,0.03125,0.375,435739.1474,0.140956796,0.01171875,0.150446971,0.053278689,0.036885246,1.67090169,-1.932181981,0.041666667,0.956683945,0.036885246,95.98622047,0.016393443,1.404753834,335.3926702,0.606694561,-0.0516,0.919282727,0.210526316,0.012295082,0.06147541,0.296296296,0.055555556,0.272727273,263.3839662,404912.0859,243759.7901,0.059071429,0.395225694,1.35,0.333333333,0.177058824,0.076388889,1.618500739,0.878,0.020863636,0.049180328,0.136363636,0.031333333,0.388888889,0.0234375,0.02734375,0.212686567,0.790734147,0.8744,0.052631579,0.055555556,0.816,0.06147541,0.034155233,0.03125,0.041666667,0.842105263

It's a very simple concept, explains lead engineer Sarah Chen (ph). No one wants to cause a scene by calling someone out for their scent, so our solution is both effective and, more importantly, anonymous. Each strap and handle on a train car is equipped with a special mechanism which, when activated by a subtle twist and pull motion, dispenses a pleasant fragrant mist which deodorizes the area immediately around the olfactorily affected passenger. (LAUGHTER)  While attempts have been made to alleviate train stench in the past, this is the first to be passenger-operated.

Turn it on, count sheep, and you'll drift right off. But as soon as Nina started using it, she started waking up in the middle of the night screaming in a cold sweat alongside her partner, Nigel Smyth (ph), who'd likewise be clutching her and hyperventilating - all this while their daughter, Mercury Bacon-Smyth (ph), kept sleeping like - well, like a baby. Her mum friends and their partners were having the same problem - nighttime terrors. No one knew why. One night, after baby Mercury was extra fussy, Nina tried to lull herself back to sleep and turned the Sleep Sheep up to 11. As she sat listening to the swishy, uterus-y (ph) sounds, she heard a deep male voice - or did she? As she listened super-duper closely, she could barely make out the sheep singing in a baritone. The tune was like a soothing nursery rhyme with horrifying lyrics about devouring a baby. (LAUGHTER)  It was sung in this really creepy voice, Nina says.

What is our purpose? How many roads must a man walk down before you can call him a man? And the biggest question of all - which way do I place the toilet paper on the toilet paper holder? You could go with the end of the roll draped over the top, causing the paper to cascade over the front like a pillow-y (ph) waterfall. Or you can go with the end of the roll tucked discreetly under the roll itself, allowing for a more restrained and modest unfurling. You don't care which way your toilet paper emerges from its cushiony, two-ply cocoon? Pick a side, you coward.The over-under debate has raged for years. It has led to unmendable rifts betwixt roommates. It has laid waste to marriages and even sparked the bloody Iberian toilet paper wars of the late 1950s, which is why the people at the magazine Choice - a sort of Australian Consumer Reports - decided to settle this vexing issue once and for all. This week, they published an incendiary article featuring a recently discovered patent from 1891 for the original toilet paper roll. It included a detailed 128-year-old pictograph which showed definitive proof of proper paper placement over the top of the roll - over. (CHEERING)  Thank you. It was a stunning proclamation. After today, mankind shall never be the same. Brother will no longer fight against brother.

100,2019-02-16T00:00:00Z,Luke Burbank,43,Male,Undergrad,Yes,Radio host,1,Mooooooom (ph).,0,0,"A potential disaster was narrowly averted last week when two armed F-18 Hornets were scrambled to respond to an airborne disturbance over an elementary school in the town of Sedro- Woolley, Wash. We didn't know if it was going to be al-Qaida or aliens, pilot John Bolden told the Skagit Valley Herald. It just looked like a cluster of some kind of small war craft on the radar. It turned out to be something much more sinister, five drones being piloted by five different parents watching their kids play during recess. (LAUGHTER)  Apparently, things started when Jan Saperstein, the mom of Braden, a fourth-grader, heard from her son that the other kids were cheating at tetherball. Using a drone camera that her older son, Kaden, had, quote, ""begged for and then never used, not even once,"" Jan did uncover rampant tetherball and hopscotch cheating and even photo documented it, sending the drone pics to the school administrators. This led to a number of the accused kids' parents buying their own drones to gather their own evidence. The number eventually grew to five, known in aviation circles as an overparenting of drones. (LAUGHTER)  The mid-air dogfights that had started breaking out posed a real danger to the students.

The British tabloids called her Dr. Pippy (ph) long darts. (LAUGHTER)  The semi-final round started like any other. Dr. Gurtson and her challenger Charles Cook (ph) walked out and shook hands. By the second round, Charles Cook was visibly sweating and also whispering to each dart before he threw them. His last six throws missed the target entirely. Things looked good for the American, but then her behavior also became erratic. She start gazing at each dart, turn them around, touching the point with her thumb and then seemed surprised each time that they were sharp. Finally, the match was called on account of both contestants not being able to continue. Finally, the disorientated Dr. Gurtson admitted to the truth.

When the popular troupe Bisan SuperFire (ph) swung through the Osaka-jo arena, Kai Jo saw his chance to get up close and personal with his idols. Nakamura laid low, and then, once the show started, he sprung into action.

They lost their mascot. For almost two decades, Lyudia (ph) was the 6-foot star of the rundown zoo, attracting thousands of visitors. She could sign hundreds of words and loved to catch bananas from the kids who'd wave at her. She could even break dance. So when she dearly departed, management feared the zoo would also die from lack of attendance. There was only one thing to do - keep Lyudia's demise a secret and stuff zookeeper Merick Cep (ph) into a gorilla suit. (LAUGHTER)  Cep threw himself into his role wholeheartedly. From opening to closing time for the past month, he played Lyudia, even going so far as to pretend to pick nits out of the hair of his colleagues who came to feed him - or her. But the jig was up when 6-year-old Andras Pavlov (ph) attended the zoo with his camp last week and threw a banana to the ape man he thought was Lyudia. The gorilla moonwalked away from it. Another kid threw her banana. They all had bananas in their lunch that day. And soon the gorilla was scampering all over the cage wildly dodging bananas until, little Andras says, the gorilla kept showing us her middle finger.

The problem with all that technology is that it can cost north of $6,000 and puts help out of reach for many. Enter the RAM horn, Restorative Audio Modulator. Modeled after the ear horn and made for centuries from tin or brass into shapes of various funnels and bugles, audiologist Sarah Moore's company Speak Up uses 21st-century 3-D printing units to produce custom-fitted ear horns. For as little as $30, these parabolic plastic cones use archaic technology to capture the sound and direct it into the ear canal. Models vary in size from the French horn-like Horn O'Plenty for the severely impaired to the diminutive pipsqueak, which can be worn on a lanyard around the neck.

The Spanish city streets have been plagued with poop problems for years, with thousands of dog owners more keen to pick up a cafe con leche than their doggy's doodies. Exasperated city officials invested 3 million euros on a pilot program of 10 poop bots which use sensors to detect feces in public areas, scoop them up with robotic trowels and collect them for later proper disposal. Things were going great for the first few weeks until sanitation officials started noticing a problem. The poop bots stopped picking up poo. We don't know what is the problem, sighed sanitation director Francisco Fernandez (ph). (LAUGHTER)  One day the robots are picking up the caca no problem. (LAUGHTER)  The next day, less caca and less and so on.

(LAUGHTER)  Maverick inventor Ban De Sung (ph) has created a tiny communication device covered in cerulean enamel that will replace one of your current boring, nonconnected molars or bicuspids and act as a handy intracranial receiver and microphone. The human skull is inherently a great amplifier, acoustically speaking, explained De Sung. Wearable tech is all the rage in South Korea with consumers there rushing to embrace the cybernetic revolution in ways that go beyond Fitbits or earbuds. According to Wired magazine's Tyler Grayson (ph), it might sound a little extreme to get a phone accessory that requires oral surgery in order to install it, but the market has been crying out for this kind of next step. As for actually using the blue tooth Bluetooth, De Sung insists activating the device is simplicity itself. To pick up a call, you merely jerk your head to the left and then jerk to the right again to hang it up. To dial, you either really think about the number really hard, or for an extra fee they can install a keypad into your other teeth that you dial with your tongue.

Why not an electric tooth?","for the literal-minded tech geek in your life comes the latest bluetooth headset from south korea which is literally a blue tooth that you set in your head.   maverick inventor ban de sung  has created a tiny communication device covered in cerulean enamel that will replace one of your current boring, nonconnected molars or bicuspids and act as a handy intracranial receiver and microphone. the human skull is inherently a great amplifier, acoustically speaking, explained de sung. wearable tech is all the rage in south korea with consumers there rushing to embrace the cybernetic revolution in ways that go beyond fitbits or earbuds. according to wired magazine's tyler grayson , it might sound a little extreme to get a phone accessory that requires oral surgery in order to install it, but the market has been crying out for this kind of next step. as for actually using the blue tooth bluetooth, de sung insists activating the device is simplicity itself. to pick up a call, you merely jerk your head to the left and then jerk to the right again to hang it up. to dial, you either really think about the number really hard, or for an extra fee they can install a keypad into your other teeth that you dial with your tongue.   there are skeptics, but de sung dismisses such naysayers. the genius of it is it works like a regular dental implant. you can chew, talk, anything, all while taking a call in the privacy of your own head. you have an electric toothbrush. why not an electric tooth?",2017,145,0.722222222,0.6249,0.031007752,0.14095082,0.079,-0.8702,1.213351648,0.019379845,5.288181818,5.127142857,-0.8555,346.6611111,0.015625,0.007633588,0.007604563,1.529035689,0.003875969,0.058139535,0.092307692,0.031007752,0.5,0.087584027,0.022813688,1,411537.3697,0.172046595,0.011450382,0.176372882,0.042635659,0.027131783,1.712979613,0.74175194,0.078125,0.955024572,0.023255814,98.36971777,0.034883721,1.346291202,315.973822,0.592592593,-0.296,0.940146267,0.25,0.019379845,0.089147287,0.103448276,0,0.086956522,272.1308017,500516.1974,329868.4764,0.11395,0.127054389,1.576271186,0.101694915,0.183846154,0.014925373,1.474512902,0.742,0.036611111,0.027131783,0.108695652,0.073819672,0.038461538,0.041984733,0.034351145,0.133079848,0.8040205,0.954166667,0.1,0.015625,0.883,0.046511628,0.011420747,0.019083969,0.078125,0.55

Two days in a row of watching Father Stevens fill out his cassock and wave the censer and she found herself thinking not so much of the kingdom of God as the hotness of him. She started going to confessional once a week and then every day. Not having many new sins to confess, they would chat about her life, their mutual interests and fun stuff like the pope's latest encyclical. After two full decades of chaste conversation, she said screw it. If God is love, he has to be down with this. So she went to confessional one day and laid bare her dirty, dirty soul by asking Father Stevens to marry her right through the screen.

It was a two-bedroom, two-bath in the hippest part of Downtown Toledo, not too far from the Huntington Center, a popular music venue. The house had a beautiful great room, and the den even had a built-in beer tap. All this turned out to be the blessing and the curse. Every three days or so at 1 a.m. or later, there'd be someone trying to get in with the wrong key or a truckload of guys out front ready to party. After checking the incidents against concert schedules, they realize they had bought the roadie house. Every concert venue has a nearby house where the promoter puts up the roadies and the crew, and these houses are known for epic parties. The address is always hidden somewhere at the venue that only the roadies can find. We tried to make it work, said Jennifer. Julian put a sign at the Huntington Center saying the party was not at their house, which the roadies took as code for the party is at their house. (LAUGHTER)  One night, a few roadies broke in through a window.

Many were cool and intriguing and the stuff of spy novels. Others were patently ridiculous. This week, declassified CIA documents revealed several plans both we and the Soviets hatched to try to undermine and destabilize the other country that were so bad they have been reclassified as horrible. One particularly lame tactic, first proposed by the KGB, was to intentionally pick embarrassing code names for our president and then leak that name in order to embarrass him. Among the suggested nicknames for Ronald Reagan was Banan Kovboy, or Banana Cowboy, a reference to the ignoble portions of his film career.

For the next 30 minutes, Santa, accompanied by Cameron in an elf hat, walked through the aisles, pulled toys off the shelves and gave them to a family who happened to be shopping that morning. The family, of course, was thrilled, and Cameron was overwhelmed with hugs and happy tears. It was a great day until Cameron emailed his regional manager about the event.

People were going to work, taking their kids to school, trying to figure out how to spell Kyrgystan. Then, someone noticed something strange over by the eternal flame at the city's World War II memorial. Right there, in broad daylight, two men in their mid-20s were using said flame to roast potatoes on a stick. After a couple of minutes, the men got scared and ran off but not before the incident was captured on video, went viral and sparked national outrage at the men whose faces can't be seen in the video and remain unidentified. Bishkek Mayor Albek Ibraimov issued a statement on Tuesday appealing to residents to come forward with any information on the, quote, ""vandals."" It's not clear what charges the men might face if caught since there is no law on the books explicitly forbidding the roasting of root vegetables over a memorial flame. But it does seem more than a little tacky. Rumors and speculation are running wild with almost every Bishkekian (ph) speculating on the identity of the two mystery men. Some suggested they are performance artists making some sort of bizarre statement about war, memory and, one supposes, potatoes. Others throw out the possibility that the duo might be scientists from Bishkek University who were in the middle of a vitally important potato research when their lab's only bunsen burner broke forcing them to find another heat source. A few have even posited that the pair might be part of the hip, up and coming Bishkek foodie scene. And they were just trying to start a new pop-up baked potato bar.

Once, Liam hit Noel on the head with a tambourine during a concert. Then Noel hit Liam over the head with a cricket bat in the recording studio. And they also spent hours in interviews talking about how much they hated each other. And one time, Noel even said of Liam, quote, ""he's like a man with a fork in a world full of soup."" Well, this week, the British tabloid The Mirror reported that over the years Noel Gallagher tormented his younger brother Liam by exploiting his fear of ghosts. Said Noel, if we were ever anywhere remotely spooky, we'd tell Liam that the house was haunted, particularly his bedroom. And Noel's childish scheme to scare his brother like a child was childishly simple. When Liam would get up in the morning and leave his room to have breakfast, Noel, or someone else from the band, would go into his room and turn all the pictures around or move a lamp to the other side of the room or perform an equivalent low-level prank.

And it was indeed the last thing Ellie and her new husband Mark expected when they walked into their wedding reception and discovered that instead of the band they had hired after months of research, the evening's musical entertainment would be provided by her father and his acapella group from college. Brian had corralled the members of the group, cleverly titled Melodious Thunk, and called the real band to cancel the week before. So guests expecting to hear wedding standards like Kool and the Gang's ""Celebration"" were instead treated to acappella classics like Bobby McFerrin's ""Don't Worry Be Happy."" I kept waiting for the real band to show up, said one partygoer who wished to remain anonymous to protect her anonymity, but then my dad and his friends just kept whacking their chest and making clicking noises. I was mortified. Burkstein never expected his daughter to have such a negative reaction.

Luminaries from Christina Aguilera to Roseanne Barr have delivered famously flubbed versions of our national anthem. But not everyone lets a tangle with the patriotic tune keep them down. At a Little League game in Sanders Creek, Ohio, city councilman Jeff McCrory (ph) mumbled out a mangled rendition of the song, which included re-imagined lines such as all the bad parts we watched and twilight's last feeding. I'd say he only got about 12 percent of the words right, reported one spectator. Through the perriest (ph) flight. What does that even mean? Councilman McGrory was mortified. And after repeated requests to redeem himself and repeated rejections, he decided to take matters into his own hands. At a playoff game on Sunday, just as the anthem was about to be sung by a local church choir member, loud feedback could be heard near third base. It was the councilman who was wearing a headset microphone and lifting a boom box over his head, a la John Cusack in ""Say Anything,"" while belting out the national anthem. He had clearly studied up and nailed every single word with some of it even in tune. All appeared forgiven until the end when McCrory went for a grand finale.

This week, Dr. Paul Booth, a historian at Keele University in England, found what just may be the earliest reference, dating from the year 1310, of the word fork, which is, again, not to actual word. The reference is to a man known in legal documents as, quote, ""Roger Forkedbythenavel.""

Booth thinks the nickname could actually refer to an attempt at fornication by the inexperienced young Roger, who chose the navel as his, let's say, point of entry with a young lady. The embarrassing episode may have later been reported by Roger's confused and presumably very dissatisfied girlfriend, which led to the unfortunate nickname.

Timmy was small and quick, and the ball boys were, too. They were in on the action and vital to the game, right where he wanted to be. Timmy practiced. When he was a little kid, if his mom dropped anything, Timmy raced to pick it up. (LAUGHTER) It sort of became a game between he and his mom. She'd drop things on purpose to see how quick he could grab them. Growing up, Timmy volunteered at local tennis tournaments, making it as far as the preliminary rounds of a pro tournament in nearby Indian Wells, Calif. And even catching a 110-mile-an-hour Pete Sampras serve in the groin was not enough to quash his love of the ball boy art. (LAUGHTER)  Timmy's all grown up now and an employee at Nike, and he finally got the chance to honor his heroes. Last week, Nike unveiled the Air BBoy, a tennis sneaker Tim designed just for ball boys. Smooth and understated, with an air sole for quickness and comfort, it was designed for the quick sprints a ball boy requires. And of course, it was going to be classic tennis white, the only color professional tennis shoes should be. Turns out, not many shared Timmy's ball boy dream as the shoe was a colossal failure, and Timmy was moved back to the sock division. (LAUGHTER)

She had also falsely accused him of hitting her. He described the whole mess, quote, ""it's tearing me apart."" I ran his letter in my column, and I gave him pretty good advice, I thought. Turns out, I was pranked by someone describing the basic plot to the cult movie ""The Room,"" a movie famous for being the worst movie ever made.

In keeping with the spirit of the famous Internet meme deity, the flying spaghetti monster, the campus ministry at Covenant (ph) College, a private Christian institution in South Dakota, has inaugurated a weekly communal meal and worship service on campus every Saturday night. The celebrants are required to bring only their faith and a box of noodles when they come to what is now known as the first church of Ramen, and the service is now playing to a packed house in the basement of the college's student center. Look at the way ""The Last Supper"" is described, said Wendy Walters (ph), a Covenant senior who's a regular at the first church of Ramen. If Jesus and his apostles were alive today, they'd be eating Ramen like the rest of us and maybe Ramen would've been a sacrament for 2,000 years.

Charlotte really loves her dog, Devil. So Jordan decided to use her dog in his foolproof plan to get Charlotte to marry him. Except, it turns out, the devil's in the details. Jordan and Charlotte met as undergrads at Duke University. Therefore, obviously, the most romantic proposal Jordan could imagine was to kidnap her dog and send Charlotte anonymous messages telling her that if she wanted to see her little dog alive she had to show up on the field at the Duke Blue Devils football game at halftime. I thought it would be really funny because she hates sports, Jordan said - and also really cool to cut out individual letters and glue them into a retro ransom note. He made sure that stadium officials met the distraught Charlotte to escort her onto the field so the Jumbotron could catch all the action. When Charlotte saw Jordan at midfield on bended knee holding her beloved shih tzu, she burst into tears.

Theodora Richards - Keith's daughter - says life with her dad included some fairly puritanical rules to ensure that her childhood stayed socially mild. No lipstick until she was 16, no singing at the table and also, he named her Theodora. (LAUGHTER) Once, when Keith found her, quote, ""getting too hot and horny with a boyfriend,"" Richards told the man, cut it out or I'll cut it off.

The wholesome wife and mother of two was excited when she learned about a Betty Crocker sponsored baking contest for the first prize of $10,000. Her family desperately needed a new car and the prize would cover the station wagon they'd had their eye on. Sally was usually confident in her chocolate chip brownies, which were famous in her small town, but started to worry when she learned how many people from across the state would be competing. She really needed that car, so she started experimenting with her recipe to make her brownies the undeniable favorites. Well, it worked. After serving the four judges a large helping of her super sweet and salty brownies, they each started circling back for seconds, thirds and then, even fourths. Twenty minutes later, the lead judge announced that Sally was the winner of the first-place cash prize, but other contestants got suspicious when he went on to say that Sally was also being nominated for best rainbow unicorn. (LAUGHTER): That's when they noticed the other judges lying on the floor giggling in front of Sally's station and one judge trying to order a pizza delivery into a paper cup. Yes it turns out Sally's secret ingredient was pot and she'd whipped up a batch of extra delicious pot brownies using weed she'd bought from her son's gym teacher. The cops were called and Sally was arrested and disqualified from the competition. There is a happy ending this story however - a marijuana dispensary in Colorado heard about the contest and ordered millions of her brownies. Sally now drives an Audi convertible.

The two had been talking about getting engaged for a few months when Mark bought a ring and booked a romantic trip to a luxury beach resort. Their first activity was a couples massage - an extravagance they'd both been looking forward to. When the respective massage therapist came out to greet them, they were tickled to learn that the therapist were themselves a married couple - Greg and Misty Jones. Once on their tables, Mark and Nora were excited to relax when Misty somewhat snippily asked Greg why he hadn't remembered to replenish the aromatherapy oils. Maybe because I've been really busy dealing with car insurance after you totaled the Subaru, Greg sniped as he rubbed Mark's feet adding, Mark, tell me if this pressure is OK? (LAUGHTER) Oh, are you trying to say you can't be responsible because of my driving, Misty huffed as she worked on Nora's neck. Raising his voice, Greg barked, no. I'm saying you need to get off my back. The bickering escalated until Misty finally blurted out she didn't love Greg anymore and wanted a divorce to which Greg responded that was great 'cause he wasn't even sure if he'd ever loved Misty.

At New York City's Copacabana Club, Jones was working the crowd when all of the sudden a woman stood up, peeled off her panties and hurled them at a stunned Jones. So the next year, when Jones was getting a lukewarm reception at Vegas' Flamingo Hotel, Bernstein, armed with a fat wad of Benjamins, rounded up a bunch of women to fling their knickers at Tom Jones.

Even in the 1870s, humans were obsessed with ridiculous photos of cats. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) : Long before dogs began playing poker on velvet paintings, the dignity of the domesticated feline was doomed. Probably the first person to blame for silly cat pictures was English photographer Harry Pointer, who snapped approximately 200 photos of his perplexed, albeit jovial, Brighton cats. Pointer often arranged his cats in poses that mimic human activity. A cat riding a tricycle or cats roller skating was what people loved.

A school bus had flipped upside down in a ditch, trapping the children inside. Thinking fast, Dr. Baarf retrieved an ax from his trunk and smashed open several windows, allowing every single child to crawl out to safety. Well, Tipton, Indiana laughs no longer.

Only you, with $100 million of your tax dollars, can prevent forest fires. Citing the current wildfires raging in the West and in a whip-like government response to the 1988 fire in Yellowstone National Park, which destroyed one-third of the forest there, Wyoming Senator Michael Enzi has attached an earmark to a routine spending bill calling for the installation of a thousand-square- mile, automatic sprinkler system in America's national treasure. We have sprinklers in our schools and businesses; why not in our precious parks, said national park spokesman Jamie Rios, not pausing for a reporter to offer 100 million reasons why not. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER): The Yellowstone River has all the water we need, and tapping into the dozens of natural geysers will keep the system charged. Rios claims the hundreds of miles of plastic pipe gurgling hot water every hour or so will be a comfort rather than a nuisance for jumpy visitors. It's like having a million tiny Old Faithfuls.
