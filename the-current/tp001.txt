3	... we need to work hard to make it happen
0	3d is better than other bands in the whole country
1	a ban on sales of new petrol vehicles would be more sensible than an outright ban .  an outright ban is itself wasteful
0	A carless life is much more fun
1	A good idea in theory but would have to change a lot of infrastructure. Not to mention industry and jobs.
1	a good idea to protect our earth !
0	A good opportunity to reduce harm to the environment
4	A N G E R Y
1	A s part of many other changes
0	A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
1	A step in the right direction.But not enough.Agriculture and industry needs to change dramatically.
1	A suitable alternative is needed before they can be banned such as hydro.
3	a viable alternative is needed. lithium battery powered cars are not the long term technology. we need a new energy storage system
0	a viable alternative should be found and used by all
0	a world where petroleum rules will lead to an early denise. fossil fuel is not the futureand leads to far more than just climate change
2	Ä« dÅnt knÅw why thÄ«s Ä«s Ä gÅÅd År bÄd Ä«dÄÄ
0	about other ways to make thm drive
1	about time to ditch old unhealthy technology. we have better alternatives now
1	ACTION IS THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE CHANGE. ALSO BAN ANIMAL AGRICULTURE
3	ahhhhhhhhhhhh help someone oh and u shut it mahi i thought we were friends but i thought wrong
0	all i can say is tesla
0	all the fish and all the birds are so exciting to see!!!
0	all the thibgs in the museum are verry intreaging
1	Alternative energy sources are readily available. We should not sacrifice our environment for monetary savings.
0	alternative fuels are the future. both economically and sustainably. onward.
0	alternative less polutant technologies should be introduced
1	alternative resources need to be more extensively used to ensure the earth continues to be inhabitibe for future generations to come
0	alternatives exist and should be utilised
0	alternatives exists. fund for thefuture not the short term
3	Although electric cars may have less emissions when you use them. They still require earth magnets to be mined and use lithium batterys
0	although it produces more carbon to make the motor of an electric car it would be worth it in the long run.
1	Although it's a good idea; I hope that the infrastructure to facilitate renewable energy is able to support the demand. If fossil fuels are used to generate electricity for electric cars; what good is being done?
1	Although the phasing out of fossil fuel burning transport is still important it is only marginally helpful compared to the phasing out of animal agriculture (that feeds our huge and unnucessary apetite  for animal food products) which would be far more beneficial for reducing greenhouse gas emmissions (currenty over 50 percent f global outpt)
1	ALWAYS AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THINGS
1	amber is cool amber is cool amber is cool amber is cool amber is cool amber is cool
0	an eco friendly new zealand should he future because otherwise there may not be one
1	animal agriculture is the leading polluter and contributor to climate change. yes i do think that our transport related meissions need to be cut back but i feel that it is more efficient and significantly better for the environment and that that should be encouraged
0	Animals lived happier when humans were not around. Humans have been mean to them.
0	any step towards better more eco sustanable living is good. nxxxx mxx please
1	Anything running on petrol should be banned by 2030 (or earlier!).
0	anything the individual can do they should.
1	Aotearoa has always b a labratory for bold progressive policies. This is another area where we could be world leaders.
1	areelectic cars really sustainable? howwilllectricity be produced? are solar/wind energies really sustainable?
3	As a car enthusiast this worries me because I quite like petrol powered cars and it'd be a shame to see them no longer on the roads
1	as a nation we should recognise that we are depleting ournatural resources

1	As long as electric cars have a charge that lasts for long haul and can quickly recharge  -  great!
1	as long as ellectric cars become moreafordable for your everyday young adult / student theni think its great
1	as long as we can genertae enough electricity to handle them.
1	As long as we do electric vehicles I am happy for this as petrol pollutes and is bad for the enviroment.
0	as much as curren telectric cars still require either fossil or nuclear fuel reactors  nuclear fusion plants are edging closer and so can provide cheap and really green electricity
1	as nice as the idea is just stuck in old ways
0	as not to exacerbate our present pollution
3	ashamed when we used to do it right. how didwe get so lazy
1	at least within city centres there is absolutely no need however electric cars still need to improve

0	Balance this out with responsible and accessible public transport - and enable subsidies for transitioning to electric cars if the costs remain prohibitive
4	banned seems a little excessiv. i would b okay with them being less common
4	banned? No. They should be naturally phased out as part of a normal ownership lifecycle.
3	banning cars alone wont be effective. need to put other actions in place at same time.
0	banning fossil fuel vehicles would be a big step forward for our nation caring about our environment
3	banning petrol car is not a solution without a good alternative transport option. maybe if we have a better public transport system or more choices on electric cars. 5 G NET WORK might help?
0	banning petrol cars is a fantastic idea. Lets look after our beautiful planet.
0	banning petrol cars is one of many necessary changes we must make to fix the climate emergency we are faced with
3	banning petrol vehicles will place a huge burden on low incomes.  as they rely on cheap petrol vehicls to earn a living
4	Bans are too severe. Significant restrictions are welcome but not an outright ban.
3	Batteries are also bad for the environment and production of new vehicles to relace them is not good either.
2	batteries bring another kind of problem
1	battery production has to be eco friendly too
0	bc it sucks for the air. go electric cars!!!!! :)))

0	be interesting to see it happen and work globally
1	be nice to reduce our emmissions
1	be prepared to pay tax I dont own a car...but an ebike and use train bus taxi. petrol vehiclesshould be limited to public transport  ambulances and delivery vehicles initially till more sophisticated  public haulage people and goods alternative vehicles are built. we should be serious about air pollution and pay tax for survival

0	how are we going to survive ifwe dont take action?
3	how do you make electricity in a sustainable way
4	how elce r we going  to destry earth
0	How much of our city space is dedicated to cars? tooooo much lol
4	how will i get my astn martin lookin freshhh
4	how will i get to work? wÄlk?...
3	How will we work to curve a petroleum driven economy towards eco friendly sustainability
1	hppy tat no gas from petrol cars will be in the air we breath
1	Huge energy is wasted through ineficiencies ofinternal combustion engines.
1	human industry wull be the death ofthe planet and us all
0	humanity is finding a way forward
0	humans are an incredibly innovative species and i am excited to witness the amazing solutions we can find when we focus on savig our planet instead of our own greed.
3	humans are too selfish to protect our environment
2	humans have too many sins to repent forand must be cleansed by the holy hellfire of judgement that is the hand of god
1	humans should have been much much smarter about the pollution we have caused because it is a cheper shortterm option.
3	hunting is good because we need to eat&be healthly
2	HYBRID CARS ARE PRETTY COOL THO
1	hybrid cars are the future and we need to use sustainable energy way more than we currently do
1	Hydro engines exist and have almost no impacts on the enviroment. To bad all politians bend towards the demands of major oil industries! HYDO ENERGY IS THE FUTURE!!
0	Hydrogen car technoloy is good developed today. Under certain conditions it is even saver than petrol.
0	hydrogen cells will be ur future fuel
0	i   worried cos this worldis fucked
0	i  am excited about electric cars and having better public transport options. invest now for my future
0	I  am so so so so excited because the poler bears will get back theirsnow and there will be homes for so many animals
3	I  am worried because if all cars are electric ther might notbe enough for  your every day needs
1	i  dont want the earth to die
2	i  eat cheese  so  no  worry
1	i  feel this because i hope itll work but it mite not
0	I  hope that they are banned sooner but its still great
3	i  think  cars  are  polluting  the  world.
4	I  think  that it is not  good.
1	i  think its a good ide and we need to start doing something sbout climatechange
1	i  think renewable energy is a better one
1	i  think that petrolcars should be BANNED because the green house gas they produce is harmfull to the enviroment . And worried because electriccars are very pricy at the moment and  they could still be pricy then.
1	I  think that the planet is more important than getting around the city in comfort.
1	i  think that this is a good idea so we can help stop climate change. i really want to stop climate change because when i grow up i dont want earth to be ruined.
4	I  thinki its silly because peps need to go places
0	i  want aotearoa and the world to be a safe beautiful place where peoplre and nature thrive
0	i actually dont fully agree with this. i thinkthatpetrol cars should be banned in   2023 at the max. we have climate emergency and even though transportation is not the main cause of this it still needs to stop asap
1	I agree more needs to be done to reduce carbon emissions. However, 2030 seems like a really short timespan to build the infrastructure for electric vehicles and better public transport. Without it the people who will suffer the most are the poorer people in New Zealand who won't be able to afford expensive, new, petrol-free vehicles.
4	I agree with better/alternative fuels but I will always disagree with a law to ban anything. That is not practical. A free market will always provide a better solution.
0	i am  Excited for my sisters Birthday.
4	i am a farmer from the wop wops and ilike thesmell of petrolon my quadbike
1	I am a wind energy analyst so it would be good for buisness... and the planet
1	i am afraid there is too much business around petrol to stop using it all of sudden... but i do sincerely hope we will do it. we should think about what kind of world we are leaving to our children...
4	i am angry that someonestarted to hunt
0	I am assuming that your "petrol cars" in the question actually means "petrol and diesel" and we are talking about all new cars, buses and trucks. We need to change to a zero carbon economy and the sooner we do it the better. An individual person doesn't have much control over this sort of thing; businesses obviously want to make money; so by having legislation like this, everyone is pushed along in the right direction. It is great to see the proliferation of hybrid cars these days, and the emergence of really practical electric cars. Bring it on!
1	i am aware of human  frailties!
0	i am beta liberal so i love things for inferior males
3	i am concerned that if we go to vehicles which are quiter they will be too quite for cyclists or pedestrians to hear
0	i am excited beacause its my first time i'v been to the event
0	I am excited because feul emmisions are taking toll on the climate and I am sure that banning petrol cars will help agreat deal.
0	I am excited because no cars that have petrol will be driving so animal and plant species willnot be endangered
0	i am excited because this is my first time here
0	i am excited because we do notneed to go to the petrol station as much and it will be good for the world.
0	i am exited because its efectingour life and we may not be able to last as long
0	i am exited because ofthe amount polution that gets into the world every day
1	i am hope full because  i wat this to stop

0	i am hopeful because i have friends
1	i am hopeful because we are doing more for the newer generation so thatwe can have a good future
1	I am hopeful for greenhouse gas emmissions to be reduced but at the same time unhappy that although animal agriculture creates more it is rarely discussed
0	I am hopeful for mass public transit. Also what Claude said about decisionmaking.
1	i am hopeful that humankind realise before its too late that we need to look after our planet and that we need to start now. i am also hopeful that we can continue to innovate and find new alternatives to processes that are causing some of the damage
1	i am hopeful that i will have a future in a world that cares about its environment
1	i am hopeful that people are taking action. however banning petrol cars will do more damage than good becausewe will have 3 million petrol cars with no where to put them. there will be a lot of waste to deal with. we should focus on bigger issues like reducng methane production
1	I AM HOPEFUL THAT PEOPLE WILL USE ELECTRIC CARS BECAUSE PETROL CARS CREATE AIR POLLUTION
1	i am hopeful that they will come and help the inviroment
1	I am hopeful that this will bea fun experience!
4	i am just angry.my name Jeff.
1	I am little unsure about how we will get there. However I am still hopeful it will make a positive impact. :)
0	I am looking forward to living in a world where human are able to live happily and still respect Gaia.
1	I am only hopeful  because of big business they may have greater control due to putting pressure on the govt rather than doing the right thing for the environmnet.
4	I am rich so dont care
1	i am sure we can find an alternative renewvable energy source. petrol is very slowly renewable and not healthy for our environment. i am loking forward future affordable electic cars!!!
3	i am worried beacuse the birds are dining and w need to halp them
3	i am worried because im not sure if itwill happen in time
3	i am worried because with the petrol t cant make ur world any better
0	i amictsitid because some of the birds are geeting saved
1	i believe that petrol cars are harmful to aquatic life and land animals also ME LOVE CATS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	I believe that petrol cars should banned by 2030 as our environment can not handle the growing pollution .  Cars are a major contributer to climate change and are used each and everyday by millions of people;  think what this is doing to our envirnment everyday?
1	i believe that we can collabate as a nation to make a change in the way that we travel.

1	i don t believe it will be acheived but if it happens it would be great
2	I DONT BELIEVE THAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN.

3	i dont see a realistic alternative being made available for all current petrol car owners within just 10 years
1	i dont see any other way tht we could savetheplanet. if we cant make big chang es ino u r lifestyle for the right reasons then we wonteven have a world to live in...
0	I dont see why some silly people try to DESTROY our planet so if eletric cars come it will be heaps better for our enviroment.
3	i dont thibk it will happen. people rely on them too much or dont care enough
3	I dont think it can happen without subsidies on alternative private vehicles
1	i dont think itshould be baned but just go u
1	I don't think this is ambicious enough
0	I don't think we have a choice -  we just have to stop using petrol and start working on alternatives.   Now.
0	i don't think we have a choice at this point.
1	i dont think wecan achieve it
3	i dont wanna walk everywhere  and public transport suckks.

0	i drive an ev and love it
4	i drive racecars for a living
2	i enjoy driving V8 petrol cars
0	i feel bad for people who die because some of us have a great life but they do not.
1	i feel hopeful  cos cars  are
1	I feel hopeful because it means we stillhave a chance of saving our planet so long as we makesure to that whatever we use for new fuelis ecofriendly!
1	I feel hopeful is because when petrol cars get baned than the air will be much cleaner and there won't be that much polution.
0	i feel like it gives the planet more of a chance. we can live without petrol
0	i feel sad because you waste money on gas. We could scooter or bike and it doesnt cost anything.... its free and keeps you healthy by excersising
0	i feel that it  would be good for green house gases
1	i feel that it would be awesome. however it would beahuge expense to thepopulation to have toreplacetheir cars would nz govt be subsidising ecofriendly upgrades?
3	I feel worried because many environmentally friendly ideas around an alernative to petrol run cars exclude those who  cannot afford them. However if this issue was abe to be resolved I woud feel hopeful.
1	i fell hopeful  for this because it will maybe extend the years we have until the damage we have done will be irrevsibe
0	i fink that mice populations will go up
0	i hate cars i like walking
0	i hate petrol though i love the smell
0	i have a new baby cousin
0	I have an electric car and bike and i think once people try travelling by EV they will never go back to fossil fuel ICE CARS.
3	I have concerns rearding  batery recycling  and the use of fossil fuel to creae power still in use
4	i have no money for a new car
1	i hope everyone gets behind theidea
1	i hope humans can not be distructef things to nature
1	i hope it makes a difference
1	i hope it will work and hope people will like the idea because we need to save our planet
1	i hope nz can start investing in public transport and cycling.
1	i hope public ransport and every alternative are going to develop so we can get rid of petrl cars asap
1	i hope that  the world will not  die
1	i hope that a better solution will be found that means we have more options
0	I hope that by 2030 petrol cars are banned because of the effect it is making.
0	i hope that eventually nothing gives off green house gases.
1	i hope that it helps fight climate change. things need to be done now!!!
1	i hope that it will help us with climate change and saving ur home
1	i hope that our future generation has better polution rates
1	I hope that people realise how important this could be to ensuring we have a future on this planet and that its not yet too late to help heal what has given us life
1	i hope that people will care enough
1	I hope that the next generations infront of me will realise that petrol is harmful and make people sick. I aslo think that more people should have eletric cars.
1	i hope that thi plan will sucseed because it will save our planet
1	i hope that this happens because it is bad for the enviroment
1	i hope that this is possible
1	I hope that this would have more people turning towards electric cars, or at least hybrid cars. I'm not sure if the language of "banned" is a great one, as that limits each person's freedom of choice, but I would definitely agree that electric cars should be encouraged, as well as other transport alternatives. Having more frequent, reliable public transport that is more cost effective than taking a care is definitely a step in the right direction to reduce individual's car use. Having owned a hybrid car, I can definitely emphasise the cost-effectiveness of not having to fill up on petrol as often, especially with rising petrol prices. There are lots of ways to approach this, and I think any way to reduce transport emissions is the right way to go.
1	i hope that we are able to make this happen
1	I hope the birds stay in their home because there is loging
3	i hope the poler bears feel better
1	i hope the poller bears feel better
1	i hope there are better options. Hydregen pehaps. Batteries are also a problem in terms of production and disposal or recycling materials.
1	i hope there is more renewable energy
0	i hope they gone s there crashs no more petrol spillng  into are great sea and i dnot like the smell
1	I hope they will go away soon
0	I hope this will create a positive future for our children.
1	i hope this will happen but wont believe it till i see it
1	i hope this will reduce our gas emissions but i am not sure if we have enough time
1	I hope we can at least make NZ plastic free
1	I hope we can help to reverse the damage we are doing to the environment .
1	I HOPE WE CAN PROTECT NATURE AGAIN
1	i hopewe still have time tosave our planet
4	I jusr bought a new car! SERIOUSLY libtards gone too far.
2	i just dont really care man.
0	i like being excited it is cool
4	i like cars that go vroom. not cars that go pffffffff

1	i like it and because u can play with it
1	i like it cause it sounds cool and i am funny
1	i like petrol. it tastes good on toast. now there will be more for me and those pesky cars won't be using it all up #$@#!!
1	i like the idea of it and it sounds cool
4	i like the power of a good v8
4	i like the smell of burning fossil fuels
4	I LIKE THE SMELL OF PETROL
4	I like the sound of a v12 strÄÄ«ght pÄ«pÄ fÄrrÄrÄ«. dÅnt wÄnt sÅ fÄkÄ Äss sÅÅ«nd Ån Än ÄlÄctrÄ«c cÄr
1	i like wild life and i dont want animals and plants to become extinct.
0	i live a better life without cars
3	i live in a stat e de ansiedad
1	i love cars and the noises they make but not at the cost of pollution
2	i love cars so idont mind at all
3	i love drive and use my car.if i could i would like by an electric one for the plane feel better. we never stop USING CARS IN fifteen yeats it s impossble. people are not ready.they cant keep his own dishes themselve so they cant stop using cars.
0	i love elecricity and my name is JEFFRY
0	i love electic car and petrol polutes the air
0	I love learning. but i need motivation. ith out a fture i have no motivation. i want to save the earth.
1	i love te papa so much
3	i love the idea! but we're not making swift enough progress toward this goal. i worry that not enough people care to vote for these types of policies; and that the oil industry is too entrenched and politically powerful to allow for the speed of change required to combat the climate crisis.
0	i love to be here with ny choir family
2	i lovecars and petrol so much lets keep petrol cars # i love petrol cars so much
1	i need to see the govt create more incentive or make electric car affordable.
0	i once went to toilet but forgot to wipe
3	i own a perol car and the impact of such a short transition wouldbe far too large. particularlyin rural areas
0	i promise that youl never find another like mee ee ee
1	i really  hope this will happen!!
1	i really hope sustainability becomes first nature in the next few years. humans depend on it.
1	I really hope that banning petrol cars will help the environment.( even though it might not) I also love walking.
0	i really want an electric car
2	i te mea kaoreaui te taraiwa lol tekaumawha noa ihooku tau
3	I temea kei teraru te ao.
1	i thibk ths woud be good for the world and would keep the earth spinning
0	i thin k that they are to bad fÅr thÄ Änvironment
0	i think  hydro is cars are theway.
3	i think  i feel worred because i fee like some people wont want to just use eletrice cars they just will want to use petrol
3	i think  im not well at all
1	i think  it  is possible but improbable due ti ignorace of fossil fuel damage to our biosphere.  Maybe 2040-50.
1	i think  it is a good thing
1	I think  it is a great idear but will it work? I         am hopeful because  then   hopefully   climite change will change.
0	i think  that petrol cars are bad for the environment
0	i think  that stoping   clmate chang isalways good
3	i think  that this could afected all of the wild life and it could be fatel
2	i think  that to blame the car  is short sighted.Find  better ways to convert  existing  cars to burn  clean   or  run more efficiently.
0	i think  the  cars should be baned   its good for the save the planet  and the envoiment
1	I think air quality and natural beauty are more important than fancy cars. Plus I like the Nissan Leaf.
1	i think already owned vehicles should still be allowed within reason. but all new manufacturing should be electric
0	i think animals deserve to live and never get killed in their whole entire life and they should definitly definitly say no guns in the whole entire universe
3	i think banning cars assumes a middle class income to replace with an ev  how will these cars be disposed of?
1	I think banning petrol cars is a bit severe - maybe a petrol taxwould be better. It would also be good if public transportwas improved and if the gvernment subsidised costs for public transport.
1	i think because if we keep on usibg then itwill cause global warming and melt our poles  then so many of our dearest most specialest animls will go extint
0	i think because petrol polutes our planet and  i  don't like polition
0	i think climte is really sad
3	i think electric cars are bad for our bodies
1	i think electric cars are cool.
0	i think electric cars could help reduce emissions in NEWZEALAND as we have plentyof renewable energy sources.
1	I think electric cars should rule the world because they dont polute the world as much as petrol cars and this matter is very important to me!
1	I think hopeful should be the mostsafe answer it will nakenewzeakand and other countries nore happy. but what if other petrol used objects come?
3	i think iam worried because i feellike some people wont want to use eletric e  cars they will want to just want to use petrol cars . but my mum has a eletric car
1	i think if everyone maks a concerted effort we cab achieve it
0	I think if we ban petrol cars it will help stop global warming and help us have a healthier future
1	i think if we can find good altrniie
1	i think if we don't the world will have no bird
1	i think it is a good idea
1	i think it is a good idea because  it is better for the environment and   us.
1	i think it is a good idea because otherwise the enviroment will be very spoilt and not good for our nauture
1	i think it is a good way to help the planet
0	i think it is a great idea
1	I think it is a great initiative. I hope it will reduce the affects of global warming.
1	i think it is a step closer to a solution holding against climate change
3	I think it is elitist. Lotsof people cant afford new model cars
0	I THINK IT IS GOOD BECAUSE IT WILL SAVE THE WORLD.
0	i think it is good because we need to fight about stopping climate change
0	I think it is great because we need to protect the earth
1	i think it is important for the next genoraition to get handed a good safe enviroment to growup in.
1	I think it is important for us not to use petrol because it will make the world less poluted and it will be safer
0	i think it is remarkable that the government is finaly thinkibg about nature and are going to try fixing it
0	I think it is very exciting as petrol cars emits carbon into the atmosphere which is a cause of enviro pollution by turning to electric cars we can reduce the carbon emission thus having positive impact on our environment.
1	i think it isimportant not only for our generation. but also for our kids
0	i think it should be banned because of gloal warming
3	I think it should be reduced not banned as we still rely on electricity but there could be other ways. Im worried for the future but also hopeful as there are change happeing.
0	i think it waould be good for the community and do more for animals
1	I think it well be good
1	I think it will be a difficult transition for many but a good one.
3	i think it will be bad  because other wise how will we get cars can we make hover cars
0	i think it will be better without cars pumping gas out into the envioroment and also a plus is that we can keep the enviroment cleaner
0	i think it will be fun
1	i think it will be good because less fumes
0	I think it will be much better for our planet and I think it will be a good change tomake
0	I think it will encourage a lot of new innovative ideas and will be better for us in both short and long term
0	i think it will good for environment
1	i think it wontbeeasy to put the future before profits
1	i think it would be intresting forthe results
1	i think it would be nice
0	i think it would cause less pollution
0	I think it would slow down gloal warming and climate change.
0	i think it wuld be good
1	i think ita a good idea to save earth
1	I think its a good goal but we have a long way to go before it is practical and realistic for NZ
1	i think its a good idea but i feel that most people inpoverty might find it hard as no petrol cars are not cheap
0	i think its a good idiafor the enviroment
1	i think its a promising idea. however the technology has a long way to come and the implementation would be challenging
4	i think its a terrible idea. i love my big black v8 range rover. how will i be able to show off
1	i think its an ambitious target. at the moment cost prohibative
0	i think its better for the enviroment
0	i think its exciting what technolgy will do for us and how it will help the enviroment
0	I think its going to be good for the environment and should have happened long ago.
0	i think its our responsibility to  care for the earth and all her precious inhabitants
0	i think its the way of the future
1	i think itwill cntribute toourclimate change problemand wlleduce carbon emission
1	i think itwould be amazing and more an more people are becoming aware of their enironment but some are obstinate
3	I think lily is lying about her "boyfriend" rhys...
2	i think my name is isla mae
0	I think New Zealand would be better without petrol cars as people waste money for it and that money can be used for food and to protect native wildlife/plants.
1	i think normal cars would be good because we dont need to be cool bossy and rude about it
1	i think nz needs to declare cliate chabge as an emergency. to lead by exampleand use or resurces in a responsible way
0	I think over the last 150 years we have taken our planet and its longevity for granted. We are slowly realising our way of living is not sustainable. I hope we can make impactful changes quickly enough.
0	I think petrol cars are a horrific waste of resources and we should have moved on to sustainable fuel sources by now.
0	i think petrol cars generated a lot of emissions in which put ourenvironment in danger. we should encourage others to use electric cars as they emmit less emissions.
1	I think petrol cars shoud go because they polute
0	i think petrol cars should be banned because they are bad for  the enviroment
0	I think petrol cars should be banned because they are releasig bad chemicals into the air that effect our atmosphere
0	i think petrol cars should be banned because they hurt the enviroment and kill animals its not okay to not care about dieing animals in the wild they help us live we should help them live its not fair if we hurt them in return for helping us
1	i think petrol cars should be banned soanimal and plant species will not go extinct
0	I think petrol cars suck for the evironment and that there are lots of great alternatives to drivingthem.
0	i think petrol will become too exspensive
1	i think public transport is the way to go
0	i think since we got two legs. we shouldprobablystartusibg thm
3	I think some people wont care and I think we need cars. Hopefully people buy electric cars so that we can get no petrol. But we see all theese save money on petrol adds? some people rely on cas that have petrol.
0	I think technology exists for cleaner cars that are just as effective as gas burners. If we can replace petrol-powered cars with a cleaner alternative we should.
1	I think that any effort made to reduce fossil fuels is an important change required to sustain the earth for future generations. Protecting the earth and our environment is of paramount importance regardless of the financial burden or the inconvenience or peoples opposition to change. Its not a question about SHOULD petrol cars be banned. Instead it should be asked WHEN will someone in power have the BALLS to impliment the change. And the answer to that question should be yesterday.
0	I think that by reducing our carbn footprint we can fix our ozone hole which will have a positive effect onour tourism industry. this will boost our economy thusly as we dont xport cars in the first place
0	i think that cars should be banned because of global warming and people say that in 12 years earth will not be able to be inhabited.
0	I think that cars should definitly be heading towards electricity at a much faster rate
0	i think that even though electric cars are less owerful theyare also more economical and have more torqe
3	I think that EVs are too expensive and that if we ban petrol cars it would be damaging to cmmunities in rural areas.
1	i think that fossil fuels are the past
1	i think that having better transport options is necessary but also hard to implement
0	i think that i will live for long!
1	i think that if this works climate change would be hindered-  maybe enough to buy us time to stop climate change altogether
0	I think that if we ban petrol cars then there will be less pollution in the world and we might have more of a healthier future
1	i think that it could  be good but also how would we get around
0	i think that it is a great idea to reduce our wrolds pollution by getting rid of petrol and having electric cars instead
0	i think that it is very important that we do something about climate change as it is a enourmous threattohumanity andwe cannot keep ignoring it. we have eleven years until climate change becomes irreversible.
1	i think that it will be hard to achieve but will b very good if we can doit.
1	i think that it will help save our planet
1	i think that it will help save our planet
0	i think that it willhelp the enviroment thrive
1	i think that it would be an awesome thing but it would be great if it was done sooner. petrol cars polutetheair and exellerate global warming!
1	i think that it would be good for the enviroment hehe and its good to try new things hehe
0	I think that its a really good idea because we don't need petrol cars becuse we've gt eletric cars and bikes
4	i think that its stupid beause about 3 million cars will be deemed useless. so where will they go? probably into millions of acres of land.
1	i think that itwill be better for animals and their water  because it will no longer be poluted
3	i think that not only me but everyone wants this car to leave
0	i think that people will look back on the age of petrol and think we were crazy to use it for so long
1	i think that petrol cars are obiously going to have an impacton out future
4	I think that petrol cars do so much damage to the environment that by 2030 there wont be much point changing what has already been done
1	I think that petrol cars might be banned but electric cars might become less common.
1	i think that petrol cars should be banned  sooner than that
1	i think that petrol cars should be banned because they are reckigthe envouriment and if we d not do something nw we manever be abe to do it again
1	I think that petrol cars should be banned because they are ruining the environment and polluting my future ( I am a child )
1	i think that petrol is bad . for  the enviromentand hurt nature
0	i think that petrol should be banned becase carbon emmisions are destroying the ozine layer
0	i think that that there is no point putting on that rule because some people like m like old cars so it should not be put n
0	I think that the only way to avoid climate catastrphe is to turn to a low carbon economy.
0	i think that the wholeworld should switch to renewabe energy
0	I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE BANNED EARLYIER BECAUSE OTHERHWISE THE WORLD WILL BE PAST THE POINT OF NO RETURN!
1	I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE BANNED TO HELP STOP CLIMATE CHANGE AND AIR POLLUTION
0	i think that they should really be banned because they kind of kill the animals.
0	i think that this is a great idea
1	i think that this is a possibiity in first world countries as not everwhere has access to reliable and sustainable electricity
0	i think that this is a very good idea
1	I think that this might be a good idea. We should also be using electric cars. But I don't want this cycle to repeat because we are using too much electricity. But for now this is a good idea
1	i think that thy should be banned as it is bad forthe neviroment
1	i think that to make a change we need drastic action
4	I think that we should act fast
0	i think that we should be able to breath clean fesh air in our own city and not haveo worry about how clean the air is how how its effecting us as humns our lungs and the generations to come. electrc cars will help eliminate and or lessen this problem
1	i think that we should stop because it ill hopefully stop global warming in the long run.
1	i think that withot cars it would be alot easyer
1	i think thatit is an awsome idear but it is not coming along fast anuf we need to do more about plution
1	I think thatit wouldbe good for the environment and that people don't help enough.
3	i think thatmost people couldnt afford this fancy cars that you charge
0	i think thatthey should be banned becauseit is polluting our earthand eventually us as well. (i am a child)
0	i think thatwe need toput the planet first
0	i think the date should be earlier. look at the example of NORWAY. NZshould take more positive action.
1	i think the solution should be to provide better public transport etc instead of banning giving people alternitives.
0	I think the use of "banned: here is too forceful. That's not the country we live in. But petrol cars should be phased out and I think the government needs to support this financially. So many vehicles chug out pollution. I don't think 2030 is realistic for that kind of change. 2050 maybe. These things take a generation. Look at smoking today - are young people really doing it? Not nearly as much as when I was a teenager 20 years ago.
2	i think the whole world has to come together to make a difference and that is very unlikely. The war display of 70 years ago is an example of not learning we arestill fighting.
4	i think the world is dying
1	i think there is enough solution to use something else than the petrol but it is a big buisnes and the gouvernment earn so much money. but if thepeople really care about the planet they have to do something and i think in new zeland that possible but not everywhere
1	i think there is no need with proper public transport for there to beone person  and onecar
1	i think there needs to be suitable technology to allow the move toelectric ornon_petrol vehicles
0	i think there will be less pollution
1	I think there will be more opportunities to avoid driving a car by using petrol and hopefully the majority can afford it.
0	i think theresmore efficeint ways f fueling.
1	i think they should be banned
1	I think they should be banned because hey are poluting the air
1	i think they should be banned because it ruins our air
3	i think they should come up with new ideas for why petrol cars should be baned
1	I think this because  it may be diffucult for long trips. It could also be hard for less  fortunate people to buy an electric car. But I am hopeful that the goverment  will makes this happen the right way
3	I think this is a blunt instrument statement. It would be better to have a statement saying all NEW cars must be electric vehicles by 2030. I think if this statement came into being the consequences would unfairly target the poor of our community. Government and local government are not providing effective and efficient public transport so the private vehicle is often the only choice for someone working two jobs and travelling a long distance between affordable housing and their work.
1	i think this is a cool idea because we will have less fossilfuels
1	I think this is a good idea because fuelcars produse hamful gas into the atmosphere. However if they put a ban towards petrol cars the people with petrol cars will not be abel to do anything with them and they will just be left as junk.
0	I think this is a great idea and I tottally support it.
0	I think this is agreat idea and will be great for our planet and environment
0	i think this is an obligation for our future generations
0	I think this is great because petrol and fossil fuels are destroyig our planet
0	i think this will dramatically help our environment however what will hapen to the cars
0	i think this would be areallyvbig step in terms of environmental change
0	i think this would makefor a greener future
4	i think u should to the old squid video and get the old eathquak house bac
0	i think we can come up with better methods of getting from point a to point b without digging up and burning dead dinosaurs
0	i think we can use much cleaner forms of energy
1	i think we gave the brain power we just need to put our money where our mouth is
1	I think we have a chance to influence a new way of living. Let go of what is killing our people and our planet and move towards what nourishes us.
1	i think we may need longer but am optimistic it could eventually be possible
1	i think we need to be hopeful. with hope. we can do great things and achieve a better tomorrow
1	i think we need to change
1	i think we need to invest in electric transport and the infrastructure to support it.    we should all be riding bikes anyway
1	i think we should be looking in to other options to cars
0	i think we should be taking action and this is a good way to do it
1	i think we should have come far enough inalterbative energy technology we wnt have need fo them
1	I THINK WE SHOULD JUST BAN THE SALES. THEREFOERE EVERYONE DOESNT HAVE TO BUY A BRAND NEW CAR
1	i think we will encounter a heap of problems along the way but i think as a country we could  pull it  off
3	I THINK WHILE ITS A GOOD STEP IT WONT BE ENOUGH
2	i think will have a better solution
0	i think with on cars that are not electric
1	i think you should sub to ########
0	i thinkit is an excellent sustainable idea!
1	i tink its important to use environmentally stable option for our fture
1	i totally agree because of global warming
3	i travel 165 km eachcay to get to work
1	i wanna live in a safe accepting world
3	i want a car in 2070 so plz dont
1	I want a future for my child where the CO2 levels are kept to a viable level.

0	i will have toget a new car!
3	i won t be able to afford a new electric car to replace my current car
3	i wont be able to go toilet
2	i wont be here and was smart enough not to breed and continue puluting the planet with humans.  destroy all humans.
0	I worry about destroying our planet.
3	i worry because what if it doesn' t  work something bad could happen
1	I worry that electric cars will not solve the problem as the energy needed to power them has to come from somewhere and its not yet all coming from renewable sources
1	I would be good for our system in the future
1	I would be happy for this to take effect. In the short term it would take a toll but it would hopefully inspire people in larger countries to take action.
1	i would like  to think tht people might re evaluate their priorities and choose leisure activites that dont impact so negatively on the environment
0	i would like to see more cycle friendly and safe roads in Aotearoa
0	i would like to see more sustainable and eco friendly modes of transort tohelp reduce ecosystem disturbance and global warming
1	i would like to think that there is still a chance of saving mother earth
1	i would like to think we could do it
1	i would lv this to happen but technological avaliability nd econoical restrictions make this extremely difficult
0	iam curious to know about how the future will be at that time with nopetrol cars in terms of reliability.
1	iam hopeful this will happeb bt not excied because i thibk the goverment will take a lot of convincing.
0	I'd like to leave a better world for future generations
1	I'd love to see NZ transition to a sustainable energy regime but I fear that the fossil fuel industry will block research efforts.
0	Ideally the date would be earlier (2025?), but that would require major incentives from the government to support the transition. Electric cars are still unaffordable for most people.
1	ideally the focus should not be a ban on petrol cars but peoples attitudes towards transport and the greater affordability of electric vehicles
1	if all other countries  are making it happen NZ should be able to do it better and quicker.
1	If electric cars can become affordable to the average person and there is widespread charging station availability then they are far and away the future of transport.
3	if electricity is still generated by fossil fuels we are not improving the situation
1	if governments and companies can stop thinking about making money i think they could work out a healthy and permanent solution
0	if hemp wasnt made illegal we would already be there. stupid old people
1	if it happens what will it be replaced with and will that cuse porblems in the future
1	if it works it would be cool
1	if it works then yay us. if it doen't people are disappointed
0	if its true it would be helful
1	if people band them they will band other things and i care for nature
1	if petrol car are banned by 2030. Then we can do much more and help to get our planet healty again
0	if petrol cars are banned then we are able to usemore sustainable sources of feuland keep our planet healthy and clean.
3	if petrol cars were banned  i couldnt afford a car
1	If there is enough charging stations
1	if this actually happens wordwide there may be hope to recover from the damage we have already done.
1	if this can coe about it would greatly decrease the pollution by a large amount
1	if this happens we have a better chance of protecting our world and everything in it
1	If we aim for 2030, the reality will be that by 2050 we might be closer to less petrol cars on the roads. The other side of this is seeing an increase in car manufacturers switching to designing and making electric or hybrid cars.
1	if we can educate and get people committed we can make a big difference to climate change
1	If we dont act quick we will kill what keeps us alive
1	if we dont changes that are irreversable will happen
0	if we dont we are doomed. we have to end fossil fuels and start removing whats there. this isnt economic or even moral. its existential
0	if we only ban the masses forcommuting needs but manage to keep car enthusiasts and car clubs going
1	if we perfect fuel cell technology and make hydrogen fuel and the materials needed more accesssible we will be able to get rid of the use of fossil fuels
0	If we remove petrol cars we have more reason to start the future. Sooner. Also please add commas. They're very important.
1	if we replace petrol cars with electric cars that have been manufactured in earth friendly ways and are powered by earth friendly electricity it can majorly reduce the amount of pollution that we create.
0	if we want a future we must learn to live in balance....
0	if we want to live it needs to happen
4	If you care about the planet then no one should drive or use any sort of emission producing vehicle. Emissions can be produced by manufacturing electric vehicles too. Everyone should just walk if they truely care about the planet.
4	if you provide an affordable alternative to the petrol automobile and a place to destroy them then it is a good idea. China needs to do something though. If China doesn't do anythinge are doomed anyways
0	if you remove petrol cars.  people will drive "self-driving" cars and will remove accidents and lower traffic jam
0	II am really excited because I get to go to welington
2	im a bannana im weard ra
1	im a litle sceptical ofauthorities to carry it out
4	Im angry because of the birds leveing their home because of loging
4	Im angry that 5 percent of people dont care.
0	im excited because now the environment wont get harmed
0	I'm excited becng ause finally people are doing someting.  We haven't been doing anything for far to long. I'm glad to see that we are finally doing something.
1	im excited but worried too... where are all the precious metals for the batteries being made and is that sustainable. what happens to the old batteries. what about child labour in the mines.
0	Im excited for the prospect that people will focusless on petrol and more on drilling for Oil and burning fossil fuels
0	im excited if their replced with a suitable and on a renewable energy source. awesome
0	im excited to see a world which is clean and green!
0	im excited to see alternative ways that carswill be powered.
1	im fat ugly dum not smart
2	im fat ugly not smart im poor i poop in class i get bulled
0	im going to miss the smell f petrol
0	im here with my schoolseeing cool things
1	I'm hopeful again  for our world to have a second chance.
1	im hopeful athough unsure about the unintended consquences and what impact the alternatives will have ... more research is required
1	I'm Hopeful because I want the best for our world.
1	im hopeful because we need to take drastic steps quickly to have a healthy future
1	im hopefull that this idear will work
1	Im hopeing that they ban them because they arent good for the enviroment
4	im in tgepetrl industry are ou tryubg to end our livkihood
2	i'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
4	im not sllowed to plsy ont he ipad or ds in the morning
3	im not sure if i can afford an electric car...
2	im poor and me dont drive
0	im really excited for this idea petrol car has done too much harm for the environment
3	im worried as i maynot have a job
3	im worried because by 2030 itll be too late for the world. in school we are learning about things sure as ocean acidification and global warming. research has shown that by that time the ice bergs will have already melted and that'll bring up sea levels and cause bigger natural disasters and by then it'll be too late to change this. this is a great idea and i love it but that time is too late
3	impact of batteries on the envornment from ev cars
1	improve public transport  and make it far cheaper   This will reduce numbers of all vehicles.
1	improve the environment for future generations
0	improvment and inovation to the grid
1	in all honesty i want a life time supply of chips
0	in hope of saving what is left of our planet.
1	In just over ten years, I would love for us to have figured out how to meet our travel needs/desires without costing the Earth so much. Let's work together to do this.
0	In order to meet the 1.5 degree target outlined by the recent IPCC report, and to reduce the catastrophic impacts of climate change, a dramatic and rapid transition to a low carbon economy is needed in the next 11 years. Leadership has to come from governmentmaking policies that match the scale of the challenge. Our transportation sector needs to transition to electric and alternative fuels as soon as possible.
3	in trying to find another solution we may be limiting greenhouse gas emissions but making something else worse that we dont know the consequences of yet
1	increased concern about the impacts of climate change will force adaptation in relation to our modes of transprtation. greater public interest in public transprt such as buses and trains will encourage greater investment from central govt which will in turn encourage the use of these form of public transport rather than cars
3	infrastructure and replacement waste would be consequent
1	invest finite energy in developing a renewable energy and transport system in a regenerative society with distributive ownership :)
1	is it a realistic solution?? something that we are actually able to achieve??
3	is it realistc.and th rest of the  world needs to work just as hard.
1	is not good for the inviroment
3	is that date realistic? it sounds good but can we afford to buy non petrol cars. or convert motors. and whats the technology like? how realiable? what does electromagnetic waves in heavy doses do to us and the environment if we went 5g etc? what about electricity use and potential environmental damage in another way like more hydrodams etc. maybe if we explored free energy instead of having a  money focused power company... alot of these ideas are not always looked at holistically and how itaffects all levels of being now and in the future... it sounds good but ppl are usually first work and convience focused. mre than environmental.
0	is the best for our planet
3	is the fossil fuel substitute able to sustain current transport conditions. example flight shipping trains trucking transport
3	is there goingto be an affordable alternative?
1	it   sound like a   good  idea
3	it  is the future but we are not ready. tech not ready. costly and also with environmental problems.
1	it  will be better for the environment
0	it  will keep the planet clean
1	It absolutely needs to happen - but I worry slow uptake of societal understanding will slow change
0	it beggars belief that they have become so prevalent
0	It betters our health and our planet
1	It depends on what the altenate option isand its impact
1	it depends on whether the replacement models are environmentally friendly. the batteries on current non petrol cars are not...
1	it does not polute as much as petrol and  deisel would
1	it doesntmake too much of a difference. the lithium from the batteris will be just as bad when it comes to disposal andtheyare known to explode for no reason
2	it dosent matter petrol or electrict
2	it dosent relly cross my md itdosent relly matter wha kind of cars we have
0	It gives hope for the future. We need to stop burning through our resources andtake responsibility for our natural environment
0	it goes into the air and warms the earh
1	it good idea but we have to thinking about reallifetoo
0	it has to be the way to a sustainable future
0	it has to happen.  transport fuel emissions are a large part of nzs carbon foot print
0	it helps to reduce air pollution.
1	it is  bad because it kills the enviroment
0	It is a chance to use less fossil fuel.
1	It is a good idea and for a more sustainable environment but since they have been around for so long...   a very large change like  this would make eople angry and hard to chnge...but still hopeful
0	it is a good idea because CO2 is damaging the ozone layer.
1	it is a good idea for the enviromental
0	it is a great idea.shows we are serious about potecting our environment for all those to come.
4	it is a HELPFUL WAY TO GET AROUND
0	it is a major step towards combatting climate change
1	It is a postive step in the right direction. Electric cars are slowly becoming more common however a deadline would speed up this change.
1	it is a really good goal to help with climate change
0	it is a way toshare eachothers culture
1	it is a wy to stop polluting and other energies industries to grow.
0	It is about us...only about us humans who can change the climate. Soin  my eyest his a step into the right direction.
1	It is achievable and NZ is in a good position to do this compared to other countries due to our renewable energy, but it will need to care planning to allow affordable transport to all of NZ
3	it is all well and good to have this goal but where will the energy come from to power the cars.....no one seems too worried about that.
0	it is amazing and ilove the way they set itup
0	it is an esential step towards cutting carbon
0	it is an important and nessasary step for a green future. 10 years are not much time but humankind needs to find a way to intoduce an alternative otherwise it will be to late to fix this mistake. nontheless we have to shut down other sources of greenhouse gas emissions too like the kattle stocks.
3	It is an important step for our planet's future. I am not sure how to put this into practice. There are so many cars and people who do not care. And there must be an alternative..Maybe not electric cars with lithium batteries. The building of lithium batteries is so bad for the nature. It destroyes more than it helps to protect.
0	it is beter for the envroment
0	it is better for the earth
0	it is better for the future generation

3	it is good to have petrol cars .
0	it is great less fuel emmisions
0	it is high time we started living in balance with the natural world. Cutting down our emissions is a big step towards it
1	it is important to lower carbon emissions
0	It is important to start implementing drastic changes to our behavior in favour of the wellbeing of our planet and the species we are supposed to share it with. Have you considered cars that run on water rather than electricity?
0	IT IS MY BROTHERS BIRTHDAY TODAY
1	it is necessary for common good
0	it is necessary forthe planets survival
4	it is not  helping  us breathe.
4	it is not going to fix anything
0	it is one step towards stopping climat change and saving the planet
1	it is only possible to make such a change if  we alldevote ourselfes to it
1	it is possible. there are alternatives. human greed and oil big business is holding us back
4	it is qute impossible forthis to happen as more and more cars (by the thouands) are being made everyday to satisfy human needs
0	it is so much  fun here
0	it is the  intelligent solution for  the  vehicle  industry
0	it is the only future fir the planet and our children
0	it is the only way to move forward
1	It is the only way to save the planet.
0	it is the only way togo
0	it is the right thing to do to move away from fossil fuels.   we need the government to subsidise electric cars and make sure suppliers fully support and provide replacement batteries in nz.   we also need the government to invest in trackless light rail.  and in wellington not stuff up a perfectly good bus ervice.
1	it is time to make a bold move to save our planet and future. there is no planet b.
1	it is time we move to greener transportation
1	it is ultimately only possibe if it is cheaper to buy electric like in Norway
1	it isa good step for us to be taking; i hope that big oil will and business priorities will not continue to be a barrier.
0	it isawesome to not polute  earth
0	it isnot a very sustainable source of  energy and there is a tight monopoly around the amount that there is.
0	it isthe right thing  to do forthe future of our earth
0	it just needsto happen.we need to get beyond reliance on fossil fuels
1	It makes no sense to drive na individual car in cities. NZ will need to develop better public transpor
0	it makes perfect sense  . we must use renewable energy ASAP
0	it may feel drastic but i think we need  to learn to live without unnecessary conveniences. shared and public transport options make a lot more sense in the long run.
0	it means that new technologies should be available to the masses
0	It means that the enviromnt willhave achance
1	it means we re starting to get it
1	it might be some other wars in the future and the technology will be getting betterand better so th war will be much longer than before
0	It might help save the planet
1	it needs to be done but the transition will be difficult
0	it needs to be done. using fossil fuels SUCK.
1	it needs to haen very soon.climate change is taking a toll. this will help significantly
0	it saes the planet and pisses off therich bastarsds
1	it seems immensely unlikely without funding for eletric cars allowing them to be cheaper as a result
1	It seems like a promising initiative and why not?  We need to face up to using alternatives to using oil/ petroleum based  products  -  IT IS A FINITE RESOURCE!
1	it seems like a wise option
1	It seems to be more common and accepted in society
1	it should baned because it pollutes the earth
1	it should be a thibg of the past
4	it should be done sooner our planet is dying
3	it should be done way earlier!!!
1	it should be sooner but it will be a great evolution
0	it should have done years ago but all the big petrochemical companies have too much money to lose.
0	it shows that we are looking at the long term consequences of our actions.
3	it takes energy and materials to support evs and we dont know enough about what to do with the waste products. more research is needed before we commit fully to banning petrol cars.
0	it well be  good to have aletrek cars in welington
0	it wiill be better for the environment.
0	it wil force  us to to lead helther lives and nt find excuses to drive everywhere
0	it wil help with the global warming
0	it will  help save our environment
0	it will be  a  big  help
1	it will be a big step for our environment conservation and we need it.
1	it will be a difficult transition but we ahould not be burning fossil fuels anymore. however...battery production is notwithout it's own harmful impacts.
1	it will be a good reason push for better  public transport infrastructure
1	it will be a great step. but happens to old cars? recycled or put into landfills? how much will it cost for a family to get an electric car??
0	It will be an efficient way of travel and will be much better for the environment
0	it will be an iterative process getting from a to b free of petrol driven cars
1	It will be beneficial to slow climate change

1	it will be good to save our environment by reducing carbon emissions created by petrol cars. however i feel that banning them altogether may not be the most viable option.
0	it will be just a tiny step in the right direction. cannot wait for this to happen.
0	it will be much valuable to have a walking street city
1	it will be one of theonly chaces to try save the earth altough2030 might betoo late
1	it will be possible if companies and peoplemake a commitment  to alternate fuels
0	it will be the best thing for the environment and planet.  Save our world!
0	it will be the biggest thing  we can do for climate change
0	it will be very good for the inviroment.
1	it will begood to wean ourselves off fossil fuels. hoping to make alternative transport affordable for lower incomes too.
3	it will cause a huge problem with all the old cars.how should people all get new cars in just a coupleof years. and whathappens to the old ones
0	it will create so manyother benefits for people aswell benefitting our health and connection to others
0	it will force people to utilise public transport. alternatives for petrol will be developed.
1	it will have to be a big effort to succeed butwould be great

0	it will lower carbn emisions and cool down the lanet
0	it will make a difference to the environment
1	It will make it better for the Earth
4	it will make no differece because we are not responsable for global warming it is a natural occurrance
0	it will reduce pollution and gve us cleanerair
1	it will remove the amount of greenhouse gases used however the production of electric will cause more waste
0	it will set us up for a more viable way of living
1	it will take time for technology to become readily available and socially acceptable for things attitudes to change
0	it willbe so much better for all of us
3	it wont be enough to save the planet
1	it won't be until it gets to dangerous levels that actionwill be done but there are so many adovocates fighting the fight
1	it wont happen but im hopeful
1	it would be a great start  for our environment.
0	it would be a huge step towards reducing emissions
1	it would be an amazing step forward in caring for our land BUT it will be expesive for manylike myself who cannot afford to replace my car currently!!
0	it would be an incredible achievment and great for our world
1	it would be awesome but we need to be sure that as much of the old petrol run cars are reused to avoid them filling up landfills and making our beautiful land look ugly. also make sure people are actually helped in the purchase of their new electric car
1	It would be better for the environment.
1	it would be good but big gas companiesdont wat it
0	it would be good for the enviroment
1	it would be good for the enviroment but i love vintage cars and seeing them rolling down the street gives me joy so i think we should just put a heavy tax on them or something
1	it would be good to ban then bcause ofh damag to the enironment but i feeli dotknow if it will happen bt i hope :)
0	it would be great as long as electric carsare the same price as petrol cars are today
1	it would be great but has huge challenges associated with it. what is the replacement?
1	it would be great to make optimal use of our resources whilst nurturing our environment.
1	It would be great to reduce greenhouse gases and focus more on using electric and hydrogen fuelled vehicles; which have developed so well over the last few years. However all countries need to work together to be able to achieve this target!!
0	it would be great to save money and environment #stayinskl
1	it would be great to see alternative transort options
1	it would be great to stop the pollution from cars!
1	it would be great. but hard to change peoples minds
1	it would be grest if sound alternatives were available
1	it would be ideal but i image there will be some push back and rejection.
1	It would begood to see us get together to find better alternatives.
1	it would help but animal agriculture causes most of our greenhouse gases. Reducingor eliminating meat and dairy in your diet does more.
1	it would help to limit toxic gases into the oxone.
1	it would make a big difference to climate chnge
1	it would make a huge positive impact on our deteriorating planet
0	it would make me feel hopeful that we wouldnt be wrecking the planet for future generations
0	It would propel us to find more innovative solutions hopefully more beneficial for theenvironment
0	it would reduce carbon emissions significantly and be an efficient long term city invesment.
1	it would require people to caremore forthe environment so if it happens then its a good sign that people are conciously making an effort.especially politicians and big companies.
1	it would show that people can make a positive difference.  Against a backdrop of Trump suppressing climate science this is really important.
0	it would show we could do what is needed
1	it would take a huge effort from people and government. im hopeful. but money and lobbies seem to undermine current effort
0	it wouldbe great and i hope it will happen quickly
1	It wouldbe really good to lower theworlds carbon emition
1	itd be good for the enviorment but hard to do
0	itd help us not die so much
0	ithink its a fabidea to save theearth
1	Ithink that  petrol cars should be banned because the greenhouse could make Earth blow up.
1	ithink thatits a good idea but the petrol companies wont letit happen
1	ithinkthat this is good because we need to reduce the amount of  carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and we are the generation that needs to fix this because if we dont this is going to end in catastrophe and a mass extinction
1	itis inevitable. but world ecconomies whosewealth is based on fosil fuel will resist. too much wealth in few hands is a dangerousthing.
1	it'll be good for our environment and future of our planet
0	its  polluting our world so much that its not good forus or any of our wild life
3	its a bit early. they are too entrenched in our society. definitely in 40 years
1	its a bold step to help manage earths resources and help prevent global warming
0	Its a crucial step in sustainability and moving forward.
1	its a goal but i think it will be hard because of he number of cars in the world
0	its a good idea but expencive
1	its a good idea but there are far too many  petrol cars. the government would need to do a handin for an electric vehicle scheme
0	its a good idea but whatabout the big battries in electric cars those are still terriblefr th planet :( maybe we need abetter more sustaible solution :)
1	its a good idea i guess but u have to get the right infrastructre for it to work
1	its a good start but more needs to be done
1	its a good thng for are lives cause if we dont we may die
0	its a goodidea cause ts cheap and i want a tesla
1	its a great idea ....hard to put into practice
1	its a great idea and is necessary. we need to ensure there is infrastructureto support thechange
4	its a hoax by imf to generate tax and lessen your freedoms . lets get rid of factories that  produce useless goods we dont need
1	its a nice idea but we should keep some petrolcars
4	It's a nice thought but it's naive and unrealistic
3	its a pipe dream because people are greedy
0	its a smart choice and is better for the enviroment
1	its a specific goal to atchive. there is no other option tan to limit our cd2 to a minimum. hopefull sientist fin good electric solutions
1	It's a step in the right direction at least. Hopefully it is not too late.
1	its a stepin the right direction. but a lot more work needs to be done.
0	its about time. but also should be sooner
1	its absolutely necessary to minimise negative effects on the climate but increasing income inequality means most nzers will need subsidies to afford evs and public transport must be improved in our cities
1	its ambitiousbut will make a huge environmental impact if successful. hopefully it will bejust th beginning of sustainable change for the better.. only 12 years left to save the world...
0	its an amazing idea which will fuel more sustainable transport iniatives in the future. heres tosustainability!
1	its an ideal.. does not mean its everyones ideal
1	its an unrealistic goal but i would be estatic
0	its bad for the enviroment so excited for another way
2	its becuase its bad for the envioroment
1	its best for all of eternia     I HAVE THE POWERRRRRR
0	its definitely for our childrens future
0	Its exciing to see what other renewable ways are invented
0	its exciting and new i wonder what the future will be like for our children if we did this
0	its exciting to move towards zero emissions
3	its going to be an incrediblw task
0	its going to lead us to greater things
1	its good because petrol is unrenewable resource but not sure if battery is reliable enough for electric car and we need more charging place more available
0	its good for the enviroment and will help reduce the pollution in the atmosphere
1	Its good to go with non polluting power as long as we plan ahead with our resources with a planned economy
0	its great and needs to happen
0	its great if we ban petrol cars
1	its great to dream big but the everyday reality is cars arent going to disappear anytime soon.
0	its herting the plannet planes are worserits better  t ride a veicle or walk
1	it's important that public transport will be improved when this is implemented but it will be a good change:)
0	its important to make real changes
1	it's importatn we start taking bigger steps towards caring for our planet as an interntional community
1	it's interesting the number of babyboomers who arenow concerened fr the environment and are pushing for a car free city. it's hard to get  kids to daycare and be on time for work when riding a bike.
0	its just a matter of time before fossil fuel runs out.
0	its just aseasy as petrol cars so yolo why not
0	its long overdue that we use alternative sources of fuel
0	its neccesary for the earths survival
1	its necessary to save our planet
1	its nesessary. vote! campaign for climate responsibility!
0	its not a renewable energy. once petrolruns out thats it. plus its destroying the environmnt so we should kinda care about that
2	Its not going to happen. plus cant drive so dont care
1	its not good for the enviroment
4	its not likely to be practical by then
1	its only ten years to get rid of all petrol cars. although its a pretty cool idea
0	its our turn to help the environment
2	its peoples choice then y ban it
1	its possible if we invest more on alternative energy
1	its probably bad for the enviroment. will eventually kill us all via sun overheating us.
0	its really inportant for the invirement that we shange how we treat our invirement.
0	its the new possible future. the more people  care the more that can be done n the future. We need to let more people know. Our next big challenge is to think about more alternatives. I think we need more solar powered cars. we should use NZ  geothermal  energy to power buses and cars.
1	it's the only fuure we can afford
1	its the onlyway to continue our comfortable lifestyle. changeour methods .  i hope battery technology get more efficent atthe moment it is equaly  wasteful
1	its the rightstep in the future to reverse human effects on earth
1	its time to look after our home
0	its time to start caring about the consequences of our individual choices
0	its time we moved firward uckk on ths
4	its to expensive to  buy electral cars  plus i love global warming
3	its too far away.weneed change NOW
1	it's what needs to happen to make great steps towards better change.
0	Its will be good for the earth  and air
3	its worrying as theres very little options for personal transport
1	itshard to change things people are used to
1	itwill be good ffor the invirement
1	itwill be good to finaly invest in some other form of power..such as lightspeed?
0	itwill be less carbon emissions this screen s really dfficult to use
1	itwould be awsme if petrol cars where banned but it woud be diffcult
1	Itwould be great to reduce carbon emissions
3	I've been slowly poisoning the Australian prime minister but he seems to be getting stronger... help
2	ive heard electric cars give you AIDS
1	j espere que ce sera une realite dans le monde entier

1	limiting  intensive agriculture would also help. But overthrowing capitalism would be the single most effective solution.
0	Liquid fuel is not renewable. We need renewable energies.
3	lithium batteries are a hazard. lithium mining is toxic. Disposal of batteries bad for environment. Recharging requires energy obtained from where
1	l'm hopeful because everything and everyone including us might be harmed by pollution.
1	looking forward to a less polluted planet...
0	lots of emissions by cars is bad.- Also fuel exploration and industry is not environmentally friendly
3	Lots of peoples jobs and cars will be lost.
0	lots of pollution might cause a lot of animal to be extinct
3	love the theory behind it but as a broke uni student the financial aspect worries me. financial govt support would be needed
0	lower cost better for the enviroment and change needs to happen!!!!!!!!!
1	make sure people can still afford individual transport. new zealand is not densely populated so be creative with shared ride solutions public transport and keep electricity prices low while power generation needs to be from a mx of wind water solar etc. Also think about hydrogen!
2	Makes no difference to clnate change globaly
1	MAN UTD FOR LIFE. ALSO I AM JEFF
1	massive polluters. get a bike and support public rail
1	may gods wrath rain heavenly judgement upon the utter incompetence we call mankind. then and only then will savation be reached on earth. finally an elysium will be created.
1	maybe  we wont die so quick
1	maybe a perfect public transport might be invented
0	Maybe banned is too harsh (what about classic and vintage cars?), but I hope that there will be strong disincentives to owning petrol cars in general.
1	maybe it could help theworld getting cleaner air very fast
2	Maybe it might not work out because if people can't afford them then we can't move around.
1	maybe its not to late for change our way of life
3	Maybe people will be able to do this but it is more likely that we won't be able to afford a mass electric car production (which would also be awful for the enviroment and we probably couldn't overcome that pollution).
1	Maybe people will take climate change if something drastic is done
1	Maybe restrictions on the production of petrol cars could be addressed before then so it becomes a reality sooner.
1	maybe there's still time to keep carbon in the ground but we need agriculturalsolutions too to meet the atmospheric output to 2030
0	maybe this way there will be hope for humanity. otherwise we are heading for extinction
1	maybe we can have a future
3	Me and my family own a ford territory anditruns on petroland so does our BMW if petrolcars were banned we would have to buy a new car

1	new zealand can lead the way
3	new zealand compared to countries such as china and america are just a pin prick if we stop petrol cars here when they do not what effect will it really have on the world as a whole.....very little we are fighting a losing battle that will only look good on paper for political votes
0	New Zealand could lead the world on this
1	new zealand is definetly a country which is best travelled with a car. banning cars would hopefullyquicken up the developement of environmentfriendly alternatives and even better public transport options
0	new zealand is perfectly set up for renewable transport. LETS DO IT
0	new zealand should lead the world in regenerative technology
3	New Zealand still generates power by burning coal, so I worry that people are just shifting the negative effects from the public eye by moving to EVs that run off of poorly produced power.
1	New Zealanders will help lead the way for th erest of the world
4	nice idea but have little cofidence in polÄªCY makers d their ability to get thubgs right... second reason is wait untilthe technology is right before dreaming

4	nono no i just made a note that not good i love cars dont band them pls
1	NOT A FAN OF CLIMATE CHANGE
0	Not a total ban. Just a ban to new vehicles. Cleaner forms of transport are already available and becoming more affordable.
3	not all areas ar  suited for electric.rural roads  are not good enough and ditance
3	not enough electricity to charge all electric cars
4	not enough time to do safely plus destroys car industry
1	not everyone likes the idea of giving up on petrol cars so I hope they argee on this now soon
4	not soon enough. Im gonna be dead by that time. PEOPLE ARENT ACTING FAST ENOUGH
0	not sure if realistic...however i like to keepmy hopes up.. and the idea excites me
1	not viable by 2030 due to the impact on the economy but the pressure to work towards this is essential
1	nt everyone will wanttodo it. it will create less fossil feuls but disposingof theurrent cars will cause damage tothe environment
1	Nuclear power plants and electric cars are solution@
1	nz govt needs to subsidise elecrtric cars like other countries are.
1	NZ has extensive low emmission power generation we can utilise and expand.  Good vision & leadership from government and businesses will be important.
1	NZ has plenty of eco power especially if we get rid of comalco
0	NZ has the unique oportunity due to geographical location and small population to become THE world forerunner in renwable energy and sustainable living.
2	NZ is a small nation ; small population . Lesser population than other nations . NZ is surrounded with clean air and ocean water : plenty of sunshine and natural resources to substan our habitat.
0	NZ needs to be environmentally friendly.
3	NZ roads are not suitable for electric cars. Urban use of electric vehicles should be encouraged but long haul driving requires petrol or diesel.
1	nz should change attitudes towards biking - good for both environment and public healt
0	nz should try to move proactively so we are ready for international transition to low carbon economies
1	of all the innovations weve come up with its about time we solved this problem
2	of course the climate change is a big thing and its important that we protect our environment but for me its not important in which way this will happen. so maybe we invest more in sustainable cars or ships or sth lse
2	oh shut up adddi oh yeah mum gimme more apples ugh

3	people are too resistant to change. honestly i think its all talk. whos actually going to DO something?
1	people are too set in their ways tochnge from whatthy are used too. i believe it eill tke longr than 10 years
1	people can do anything they set their minds to
0	people dont care about the environment until it directly affects them. we need toact before itgets t that stage. sadly people care little about anything except themselves.
3	people havent understood the environmental impact of batteries hence the number in ev's. open your mind people to all the alternate solutions
3	People might need to use them.
1	people might not want to ban them but
1	people might wake and relalise how  this  is going to effect our future generations
0	People need a push  otherwise they wont make the necessary changes by themselves. Myself included.
4	People should be allowed to drive whatever kind of car they want and whatever kind of car they can afford. The government does not need to come in and restrict peoples freedom of volition
0	people should be taking action now not waiting for the future
3	People should have freedom to make their own choices
0	people who think that looking cool in petrol muscle cars probably have  too large an ego and too small a penis..... go get some viagra and stop polluting cunt
3	people who wn petrol cars will be forced to spend more on the new cars. this will leave them withlittle to no money or will not be able to travel
3	people will need to find another way to get to places without wasting energy.
2	People will other ways to fuck the planet
1	people will start to care about cliate change very soon
3	people wont be able to get around
1	People worry about the jobs to be lost by switching to renewable energies. I underst an d thatworry. But with these new energies comenot only new jobs but also infinite opportuniies to better care for our planet--our home.

1	pollution is only one of many reasons
1	poo poo poo bum bum bum
3	positive alternatives need to be found first or it wll never work
0	positive step towards the change we need
1	pPUBLIC transport should be provided wherever possible including rail on electricity. importing second hand cars using fossil fuels should cease. park and ride schemes shouldbe an intrim measure.
1	Prices for electric cars will have to come down quite a bit o make it more affordable. Or develop a more reliable public transport.
0	priorities should be reversed. #1 should be pedestrians #2 should be bikes #3 should be bus #4 should be cars. It's currently the other way round.

0	the faster we get rid of fossil fuels the better
1	the future of earth may dpend on it
2	the government anrt going todo anything tha will affect other very large companys that bring in heas of tax money

0	the use of diesel and petrol transportation ranks third in the cause of global warming.
1	The use of petrol is not environmental friedly
4	the wording of your options are one sided. i can disagree wthout being angry. if we had better electric cars that had batteries that could be recycled and the power supply to support this i would be more excited

0	there are better options to meet our needs without further damaging our planet
0	there are better solutions with improved public transport
4	there are better ways to spend money
0	there are bettter options already. public transport should be the nirm
4	there are no viable alternatives available
4	there are no viable alternatives. low income earners will be most impacted
1	there are other kinds of renovable energys to use that not aftect the planet at all. no more petrol!
1	THERE ARE POLLUTION ALL AROUND THE WORLD BUT NZ IS PRETTY SWAG. BE RICH AND BUY AN ELECTRIC CAR
0	there are safer and cleaner options such as rechargeable and or hemp being used in the future
2	There are so many other technologies we can use instead of feeding this insatiable polluting machine. Im CONFIDENT and EXCITED that this is our new future
1	there are things we must do to protect our nvironment for future generations but getting to the point where we have enough infrustructure to support only electric vehicles is another thing
1	there are viable alternatives to petrol cars. Hopefully they will become more affordable to the average car user and there will be a way of recycling the petrol cars though.
3	there arent the facilities in country areasto support this change in such a short space of time
1	there has to be a viable alternative
1	there is a lot of culture and craft around internal combustion that would be sad to lose. However I hope a new culture can be created around alternatives in the future
0	there is amost no public policy issue that would not be improvedby banning cars. health. housing. poverty. personlsafety. ban them. NOW
1	There is an over reliance on cars; but there is also a lack of alternative infrastructure in many areas
0	there is no need for petrol
3	There is not enough action to get there in 10years
1	there is still a tremendous possibility that we will continue to destroy the environment in order to make petrol free cars. we have to gain these materials without disrupting the ecosystem and and causing harm to the habitat when we are supposed to be doing good for our planet. we would still cause pollution in order to manufacture said vehicles through materialistic waste and unnecessary use of power.  i do like the concept though and i am hopeful that we will find a solution that can help the environment whilst still finding good transport options.
3	there is too much money in fossil fuels - it will never happen!!
0	there isthe opportunity for wellingtn to provide an alternaive to car. persective and expectation needs to change befor the innovation of another transport
1	there needs to be the political will to nmake it a reality - otherwise we will continue to bumble along  .
0	there shoud nly b e electic cars

1	theres better ways to fuel transport as already explored (electrcity solar power etc) so long as we invest production into making and further improving these options we keep our independence as well as look after the environment
0	theres got to be a better way
0	theres no choice. the change will be drastic but interesting
1	theres no point relying on something that will run out and never be used for the future generations
3	There's no way to produce enoughelecric vehicles to replace our entire fleet by 2030 - not to mention the negative environmental impact of new cars for all! I would be in favour of greater tariffs on new petrol imports or a slow phase out of petrol cars but an absolute ban would be a bad idea.
4	these are god gven natural resources for our use on planet instead of cuttng trees and digging coal for fuel.

0	they pollute and there are now econmoic alternatives
0	They polute the enviroment which could lead to the end of lots of species
0	they should already be banned. we need to look after our planet
3	they should ban them maybe sooner but otherwise yes
0	they should be banned because fossil fuels are bad for the environment
1	they should be banned because they pollute the air
1	they should be banned sooner and i really hope it happens
1	they should be but there will need to be affordable alternatives
1	they should have been banned since we knew they affected our environment. i wish better for our futur.
0	they should move it foward to 2025
0	they take up too much of the CBD

0	theyre bad for  the environment and we need to consider future gene rations
2	think of a city fullof buses and it is not business
0	think of the space and what we could do with it!
4	think ppl need  to get over it aye
1	this a wonderful thought and hope by 2030it is wellon its way if not we  can expect more polition
1	this big choice may seem extreme but will eventually create positive change globall
1	this could be a positive step to combatting climate change. however we need to do more
1	This could go some way towards slowing down climate change.
0	this great cause of climate change and globel warming un wanted gases are destoying our planet we also need to  fix our plasic useage cause thats killing our native wild life im hope we can fix it in the next 5-6 years come on new zealnd we got dis
1	this has potential to make a difference
1	this is a big move and would need alot of support. it is necassary and exciting.
0	this is a great opportunity to stop takng from our LIMITED resources
0	this is a massive step forward in terms of climatechange
0	this is a necessary step to reducing climate change
0	this is a step to normalising clean energy
1	THIS IS A STEP WE NEED TO TAKE TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE
0	this is our planet. our home. be less ignorant please
1	this is really great to ban them...
1	this is something we should strive for
0	this is the crucial step for real change to have a positive impact for the future of our species and the plane we depend on for life
0	this is the right thing to do. thiswill make a lot of opportunity for a different betterurban living. and give us a future
0	this is verycool and im thnkful they kept the pig
1	This is vital for curbing carbon emissions and thus climate change so I am hopeful thatthis goal is achieved on time or even ahead
3	this means most people who enjoy any kind of prosperity now will be under class in the future!
0	This needs to happen before it's too late
0	this s a nessesary step for all of our future
1	this seems extreme but the reality is that it needs to happen.
0	this should have been done years ago
0	this will begreat for the enviromebt abd futrere genorations
0	This will bring a significant change to the amount of pollution in the country. my only concern is. what will happen to all the petrol cars that still work? Also manufacturing electric cars will still cause pollution in our country
1	This will force us to find a better way for the planet and our own health.
1	this will help however is just one of the steps towards reducing carbon emissions
0	this will limit carbon emissions and make for a much quieter space to live in
0	this willreduceharmful emissions hugelyandfocus on using sustainabele resources
4	this would  not be a good idea due to the fact we have people who have petrol and diesel poweredcars but who cannot aord a new car due to the fact  of poverty. some put special computers in thecar to add fuel and power makigthecar less effiecient but you can also buy a computer to regulate this . oneof the reasonspetrol costsso musch welli think weallknowwhy TAXES.
0	this would be a great outcome for futuregenerations
1	this would be great for the environment!
1	This would protect our planet for futur generations
0	this wouldobviouslyassist cleaning the  environment for us and future generations
3	Though I don't disagree with the idea, the practical impact is huge and we have only ten years to achieve it. How can an economy that currently runs a fleet of "old" cars afford to change that when to most people EVs are unaffordable now? What will change that will enable all Kiwis to ditch their petrol cars and purchase EVs or whatever are the equivalent in 2030 and not lose their transport freedom?
1	though there maynot be one right  answer... every small step counts.
0	though they shoud be banned sooner.
3	thre is minimal understanding of the iimplications
0	Through crisis comes innovation.We have a chance to create a future that doesnt just sustain us as humans but nurtures us all as life
1	thst is a verygood idea plz save the environment also because the petrol market is stupid and it is exensive for no good reason
1	thstwe get it together and pass laws regulations and the goverment learns from other goermentslike sweden and norway
4	Tiis is not good.Just bought a new car.

0	Tired of breathing in digusting diesel fumes all the time. Bad for the environment and people's health.
0	Tnat is one of the ways to help save our beautiful planet.
3	To date only those with enough income have been able to afford electric cars . Would poorer families have to sacrifice their own independant transport? Reducing our greenhouse gas emissions together is hugely important but how this would affect society has to be considered.
0	to drive is a luxury and joy but our reliance on it as even the main commuting method degrades what makes it special. in addition public transport which is sufficient for our commuting needs either already or eventually will move more people more often and with less use of energy resorces especially petrol. they are moving int electric power sourced from clean methods like wind

3	Unless other options become more financially viable a lot of people will have difficulty owning a car.
3	Unless they make electric cars travel further they are useless. Not helpful towards our enviroment nor making it a better place. You always have to think about the power needed to charge them.

0	we will find much better and more sustainable means of transport that will helpus and the environment
1	we will have to change to save climate
2	we will just work around the idea
0	we will reduce a huge soure of polution
1	We would need to get passed the giant energy companies that only care about maximising their profits.
1	we wouldbe taking tangible action to address climate change
0	wehave only one planet . let s stop destroying it.
0	wehave to take care of our environment
2	well it batarys will be thrown away
1	well its obviously good.but im more concerned about the ramifications down the line of our vehicle choices.
3	well mia is a fat cheese burger chicken nugget eating pig ay
0	well they do cause a load of problems like polluting the air water and  food
0	wellington city could be completely car free and ruled by pedestrians
1	Wellington has started dotting around electric scooters and bikes to stop people using cars for short trips
0	wellington is takinga leadership role in climate change mitigation
4	weneed them to get around public transport is rubbish
2	Were all gonna die anyways. Global warming yaaay
0	were all gonna die at this rate
0	we're gonna save the planet!!! :)
0	we're in a climate emergency and need to act
1	we're in real trouble already. we must take ation now!
4	weshould stop theuse of cars because they are bd for theenvironment
0	weshouldfigureout a bettersutainable wayof life and what we use to fuelit
1	we've got so many ways to produce energy. USE THEM !
4	what about all the classic car owners and people who pull caravans or boats longdistances????
3	what about peopl who lack access to public trasportand cant afford new evs
3	What are we going to drive
1	what else can we do but feel hopeful?
3	what is next for progressives to ban? they will find something to shame us
3	what is the best solution to replace them
3	what will be left for the future genertion
4	what will happen to all the out sourced cars?
3	what will happen to those who have petrol cars
3	what will we do with all of the petrol cars? where does the waste go?
3	what will we do with out pettral cars
4	what will we generate the power with to charge the evs with ...coal?
2	what would  you replace it with. how much would it cost. where would you get the energy from.
0	Whatifthere were no roads only big geen parks and walkways the cities would be so much more beautiful  . redesign them so everything in th cente is close and accessible with underground pulic transport
0	whats going to comefrom theassociated technology beyondjust cars
4	whats going to feed the trees?
1	What's the point in using petrol when there's far more sustainable ways to transport ourselves from A to B lol
1	whats up how are you doing
1	when looking at the entire life cycle of an electric car we realize it also has a negative on our environment. Though it might be better than petrol cars. We sould keep a global thinking approach.
0	When private motor cars first became available for personal use, the shift from public transport to personal transport happened over night in many communities. I'm positive the transition back to public transport can also happen overnight.
1	When there is   love thereis hope
3	where are all the electric cars goibg to be charged.
3	where is all this power going to come from electricty is xpensive now for homes
3	where is the electricity to run alternative cars going to come from? the production of electricity in renewable ways does not produce the same energy in its life span than it does to produce the actually devices? RIP Stan Lee
3	where is the energy going to come from to produce and then power these cars  recycle the batteries?
3	where will you it put it. when you break them all
1	While it would be ideal. It feels unlikely
0	whilst having electric cars in the future; i do nt know this will actually occur.  walking may solve our problems but 2030 is too long away.
1	whist a great aspiration I am sceptical that this will actually occur
2	who can afford any other type of transport s wellas the cost of living
4	whos building thepower stations. what to do with toxic battery at end of life
2	why can w not select ourown option?
4	why did  people even make these kind of cars
0	why look for habitable places inspace when we should look after our own
4	Why not 2020? Make a change now! Make public transport more affordable. Change busses and trains to green alternatives.
1	why would we continueto use petrol cars when we know that electric carsare possible?
0	will be nice to have some space for cyclists and pedestrians again. And the air quality will improve
0	will create new options. my fear is if we dont enforce a circular full lifecycle return system for batteries to manufactuers then we may create a worse issue.
1	will help with stopping pollution oftheworld. can use electric cars instead.
1	will hopefully help the planet and stop or at least slow down global warming
0	will leave oil and other minerials in the ground to keep the world goig for a little bit longer for the future generations.
3	Will we have alternatives so we can absolutely ban petrol car by 2030 ?
0	wish it could happen right now
0	wish it was sooner.  i want to walk and jog comfortably without inhaling fumes.
1	With electric cars becoming more common the exsistense of petrol cars should slowly fadeout naturally creating cleaner air andless greenhouse gas emissions
1	With government driving this it might happen.
1	with petrol cars gone there will not be much smoke in the air
1	with proper sustainable solutions we can love and protect nz
1	with the mass production of ev cars we can exoect less fossilfule based vechicas #gogreen
3	with what we can replace them?
0	world be a safer healthier plcce .N o more wars over oil
3	worried a bit . no other means yet and ev are just jokes as it overall pollutes more and is nowhere an viable option.
1	Worried about the relatively low range and poor infrastructure support for full electric's. But I'm very optimistic about the prospects in the future. Hopefully the transition will be smoothe and we can take electrics down Arthur's Passand freedom camp in our Priuses
2	worried and angry in the knowledge the not even nz is doing enough action soon enough
1	Would be better forus all :)
1	would be good but probably not realistic
1	would be great but not sure if realistic
1	would be great to have less cars using petrol but 2030?
1	would be helpful in many ways such as reducing dependence on fuel
1	would helpreduce co2 emissions andstop over usig all natural resources
0	would reduce gas emissions and be very good for the enviroment :)
2	wtf its not good or bad
2	y do pertrol car need to be banned
0	yay i want flyingelectric vehicles please
0	yep cos bad pap charge us too much
1	yes and buy back  our electrical supply to own them ourselves
0	yes and everyone should walk everywhere
1	yes but we need a wider range of e cars... e bikes are already doing a great job on cutting down on petrol commuters.
0	Yes. Let's go hydrogen and electric (as well as those funky pedal cars from the Flintstones). We could totally do this if the government introduced consumer incentives, similar to those implemented in other countries, such as Norway.
4	you are all being brain washed by the united nations  left wing ideolgy its about time people woke up  this nnsense.  graham.
0	you run out of petrol so fast but electric cars don't
