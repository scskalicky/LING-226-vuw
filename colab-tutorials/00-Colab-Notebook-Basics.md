# What is a Google Colab Notebook?
A Google Colab notebook is an interactive notebook that lets you execute Python code within your web browser. The notebook has Python pre-installed, so you do not need to download or install anything to your computer. Another benefit of Colab notebooks is that you can also use them to write text, such as notes and descriptions that you would like to include with your code. 

The notebooks created for this course all use a combination of text + code to explain and demonstrate the content. 

Notebooks are a collection of independent "cells". Cells are either text cells (referred to as Markdown cells) or code cells. 

To cre

# Text Cells

- Text Cells include text in markdown format, allowing for you to include traditional writing separated from the code cells. 
- Markdown has an easy to learn syntax for formatting text - [Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
- (This document was written using markdown!)

# Code Cells

- Code cells have two primary inputs:
    - code
    - comments (indicated as anything preceded by a #)

- Click the "play" button to run code cells:

A code cell waiting to be run:

A code cell which has been run (green check with output):

# Internet required

- Notebooks connect to server hosted by Google
- Notebooks will automatically connect when you run a code cell, and you can also manually connect
- Notebooks will disconnect after idle or if you close them.

# Clearing Code Cells

- Sometimes the output of a code cell can get quite long. One quick solution is that you can click the "x" to clear the output.
