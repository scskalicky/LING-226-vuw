GEORGE Let me ask you a question. Who would win in a fight between you and me?
JERRY Well, what do you mean?
GEORGE Well if you and I ever got into, like a really serious fight you know, and the punches started flying -- who do you think would win?
JERRY Well I think that's pretty obvious.
GEORGE Yeah. Me too.
JERRY Hey Elaine.
ELAINE Hey.
JERRY Who, who, who do you think would win in a fight between me and ah, gorgeous George here
ELAINE You mean in a real Fight Fight?
JERRY Mona a Baldo.
ELAINE George.
GEORGE Ah-Ha!
JERRY Why?
ELAINE George fights dirty.
JERRY Really? What would you do?
GEORGE Pull hair, Poke eyes, Groin stuff. Whatever I gotta do.
JERRY Hmm.
ELAINE So. Listen ... You're not doing anything tomorrow, are you? Because I have an extra ticket to the historical clothing exhibit at the Met.
JERRY I'm sorry.
ELAINE George?
GEORGE Would I want to see what Mary Todd wore to Lincoln's funeral?
ELAINE There's nobody I can go with.
ELAINE You know what. I don't have one female friend left.
KRAMER Oh, no, of course you don't. You're a Man's Woman. You hate other women, and they hate you.
ELAINE Thank you.
KRAMER So Jerry, What time we going to the movies?
JERRY Ah, how about 8:30?
KRAMER Saddle up and ride.
JERRY You want to get something to eat first?
KRAMER No, I'm good.
GEORGE I wonder if, ah, Susan ... No. I better just go. heh. All right! See ya.
KRAMER There's nothing more pathetic, than a grown man, who's afraid of a woman.
JERRY Hey, why don't cha ask Susan?
ELAINE George's Susan?
JERRY Yeah.
ELAINE Yeah. Why not Susan. I should be friends with Susan. Of course! Susan! Oh! OK, I'll see you guys. Huh.
KRAMER That's gunna be trouble.

KRAMER Jerry, don't you see? This world here, this is George's sanctuary. If Susan comes into contact with this world, his world's collide. You know what happens then?
KRAMER Did I tell you I'm getting a new telephone number?
JERRY How come?
KRAMER Whew, chicks man. Too many chicks know my number.
RAMON Hey Jerry. How are you Mr. Backstroke?
JERRY Kramer this is Ramon, from the new health club I joined.
KRAMER Oh, yeah.

GEORGE Susan, why?
ELAINE Because I want to ask her to lunch and to the Met tomorrow.
GEORGE Oh, I don't think you want to do that.
ELAINE Why not?
GEORGE Well what would be the point of that?
ELAINE George, are you going to put her on the phone?
GEORGE Where did this come from all of a sudden?
ELAINE George, are you going to let me talk to Susan, or Not?
GEORGE I really think I should have been consulted about this.
GEORGE Here ... something.
SUSAN Hello? Oh, that sounds great. I love that sort of stuff.
KRAMER You want to sit here?
JERRY Yeah. Uh, uh, oh, oh, Over there.
KRAMER Why?
JERRY Little buffer zone.
KRAMER Buffer zone
JERRY Thank you. If we were in my apartment and we were watching a movie on the couch, would we sit right next to each other?
KRAMER No. You got a point.
JERRY All right.
KRAMER I can't ...
JERRY What are you doing?
KRAMER Well these seats have no lumbar.
JERRY Oh hey, there's Ramon. Pre, pretend we're talking.
KRAMER We are talking.
JERRY Pretend it's interesting.
KRAMER So, ah then, I ah had to kill him and ah, well the police are still looking for me.
JERRY Oh yeah that's shocking, but sounds ...
RAMON Hey, hi Jerry.
JERRY Oh, hey Ramon.
RAMON Hey, hey, I took a bunch of napkins. You want some?
JERRY Oh, no thanks.
RAMON Hey, ahhh, is this seat taken?
JERRY No.
JERRY And then the worst part is, after the movie, he leached on to us ... We wound up having coffee with him for like two hours. Then he walks us home, all the way back to the front of the building. Finally I said, look Ramon, I gotta go to bed now.
GEORGE By the way, have you spoken to Elaine yet today?
JERRY No why?
GEORGE She called Susan last night.
JERRY Oh yeah, I know.
GEORGE How do you know?
JERRY Well it was my idea.
GEORGE Your idea?
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE Wha'd you do that for?
JERRY She was looking for someone to go to the show with.
GEORGE Well that was a really stupid thing! You know what's going to happen now?
JERRY World's collide.
GEORGE Whe ... Well yeah!
JERRY Because this world is your sanctuary and if that world comes into contact with --
GEORGE Yes! It Blows Up! So if you know that, what did you tell Elaine for?
JERRY I didn't know. Kramer told me about the worlds.

RAMON So get this. I get down there, and right away, I see the drain is clogged. I mean it's obvious. Can you believe it?
JERRY All right Ramon, I'm going to get going.
JERRY I think we should separate here actually.
RAMON What are you trying to say Jerry?
JERRY Look Ramon, you're, you're a nice guy. But I, I actually only have three friends. I really can't handle any more.
RAMON Oh I see. It's cause I clean pools, right?
JERRY That has nothing to do with it.
RAMON You su --
SUSAN Yeah, we got along real well.
GEORGE You know, uh, she has no female friends! You know that, don't cha? Something strange about a woman who's friends are all men.
SUSAN Yeah, I know. We talked all about that.
GEORGE You talked all about that?
SUSAN Oh yeah. Elaine opened up her vault.
GEORGE Did you just say vault?
SUSAN Yeah, why? Did I use it wrong?
GEORGE You got that from Elaine.
SUSAN Yeah. So what?
GEORGE Well it's a little strange. You going to start to talk like Elaine from now on?
SUSAN I don't know. Anyway I thought we'd all go to a movie on Friday.
GEORGE We'd all go to movie on Friday?
SUSAN Yeah.
GEORGE This is not good. World's are colliding! George is getting upset!
GEORGE Ah you have no idea of the magnitude of this thing. If she is allowed to infiltrate this world, then George Costanza as you know him, Ceases to Exist! You see, right now, I have Relationship George, but there is also Independent George. That's the George you know, the George you grew up with -- Movie George, Coffee shop George, Liar George, Bawdy George.
JERRY I, I love that George.
GEORGE Me Too! And he's Dying Jerry! If Relationship George walks through this door, he will Kill Independent George! A George, divided against itself, Cannot Stand!

ELAINE I Like Her!
GEORGE You see . You see. You see what I'm talking about. It's all just slipping away. And you're letting it happen.
JERRY So you want to catch a movie later?

JERRY What?

JERRY Look Ramon, about the other day. I'm sorry if I offended you. I get a little crabby on the subway.
RAMON Do you?

RAMON Oh, ah, I guess they must have disappeared.
NEWMAN Hey Jerry. Look at all the towels they gave me! I really hit the jackpot! Ha, ha, ha.
JERRY It's been a terrible situation down there the past couple of days. He's really been making things uncomfortable for me. There's always a big pile of dirty towels in front of my locker ...
ELAINE Uh-huh.
JERRY And then when I come out of the pool, my towel's always gone.
ELAINE Uhh, so frustrating!
JERRY Tell me about it.
ELAINE Uhh, so you want to join me and Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
JERRY You're meeting Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
ELAINE Yeah.
JERRY I'm meeting George for lunch at the coffee shop.

JERRY So eventually these people came and, somebody, gave him mouth-to-mouth.
ELAINE He could have died
JERRY Yeah, it was a gamble.
SUSAN Why didn't you give him mouth-to-mouth?
JERRY Ah.
ELAINE How can you possibly show your face there again?
JERRY Oh I can't. They revoked my membership. Newman too. You know, we can't go anywhere near there.
ELAINE Hi, ah, three for Chunnel -- two adults ... one child.
GEORGE What the hell is this? George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. With Jerry, huh? With Jerry! Great. Great! Probably went to the 84th St. That's where I always go with Jerry.

JERRY I don't even know what, what is supposed to be attractive about fur? Why does a man want to see a woman in a fur? Men want women to shave their legs, shave their armpits, pluck their eyebrows and then before we go out, we dress them up like a bear. To me the only reason to wear fur, would be if you were trying to sneak up on another animal. Did you ever see those tribal hunters where they wear the fur and then they had the other animals, head on top of their head? You know I'm sure there's a moose looking at that going, Yeah, that looks real good. Yeah, I'm gonna turn my back on this goof ball with the extra head. Because there's nothing fishy going on there. I'll just keep drinking from the stream. I've seen a lot of two-headed tigers with knees.
GEORGE Well I am actually going to have a secretary and I get to do the interview.
JERRY That's incredible. Six months ago you were taking messages for your mother.
GEORGE Yeah, and now someone's going to be taking messages for me.
JERRY From your mother.
JERRY So this ah, woman you plan on hiring, is she going to be in the Spokes model category?
GEORGE Sure. I could go the tomato route. But eh, I've given this a lot of thought Jerry. All that frustration. I'll never get any work done. So I'm doing a complete 360. I'm going for total efficiency and ability.
JERRY That's a 180, George.
GEORGE Whatever.
JERRY Hi Willie.
WILLIE Hey Jerry.
JERRY I got this stuff and ah my mother's fur coat for storage.
WILLIE What are you doing with it?
JERRY Ah, she keeps it in my apartment for when she comes up from Florida.
DONNA Hi.
JERRY Hi.
WILLIE Hey Jerry, you know my wife Donna?.
JERRY Yeah, that's why I said hi.
WILLIE Hey, nice jacket.
JERRY Thanks. It's Hounds-Tooth.
WILLIE Whoa, this is a beauty. Great cut. It's probably very flattering.
JERRY Oh yes, it really accentuates my bust line.
APPLICANT Well, I type about 90 words a minute. I'm completely well-versed in all IBM and Macintosh programs.
GEORGE Well Miss Coggins you're ah, obviously qualified for the job. You've all the necessary skills and experience. But you're extremely attractive. you're gorgeous. I'm looking at you, I can't even remember my name. So ah, I'm afraid this is not going to work out Thanks for coming in.
GEORGE You're luscious. You're ravishing. I would give up red meat just to get a glimpse of you in a bra. I'm terribly sorry.
ADE As you can see my references are impeccable. I think I'd be a real asset here. My only concern is, I do take care of my mother. So will there be any late nights?
GEORGE I can't imagine.
ELAINE Ok, So Barney's is having this huge sale. I try this dress on. Stunning. Stunning. I couldn't take my eyes off myself.
JERRY Yeah.
ELAINE OK, so then I put it on at home. It looks like I'm carrying twins.
JERRY So you're saying, Store, Hotsy-Totsy, Home, Hotsy-Notsy.
ELAINE Yeah exactly. Anyway I've got to go over there and return it.
JERRY I thought we were going to the movies?
ELAINE All right I'll try it on again. You tell me what you think.
GEORGE Hey hey.
ELAINE Hey George
GEORGE Hey Elaine. I'm telling you Jerry, having a secretary is incredible. I don't know why I didn't have one before.
JERRY Because you didn't have a job?
GEORGE Perhaps. I walk in, everything is organized -- messages, appointments. And I can't tell you how proud I am of myself for going with Ade.
JERRY A lesser man would have crumbled. They would have gone for the dish and the sure fire sexual-harassment suit.
JERRY It's a little ...
ELAINE All Right! You answered it right there.
JERRY You got no waist in that thing.
GEORGE You arms look like something hanging in a kosher deli.
ELAINE I said, All Right.
GEORGE Well wha'd you buy it for?
ELAINE Why did I buy it, because in the mirror, at Barney's, I looked fabulous. This woman was just walking by said I looked like Demi Moore in Indecent Proposal.
JERRY How fast was she walking?
GEORGE Demi? I thought it was Demi?
JERRY No. I think it's Demi.
GEORGE Really? I never heard of a semi tractor-trailer.
ELAINE Wait a minute Wait a minute. I know what's going on here. Skinny Mirrors!
JERRY What?
ELAINE Skinny Mirrors! Barney's has Skinny Mirrors, they make you look, like, 10 pounds lighter.
JERRY Oh, you're crazy.
ELAINE Am I? Do you think I would have bought this dress if I looked like this at Barney's?
GEORGE You know I think she might have something there.
KRAMER Whoa. What are you all dressed up for?
ELAINE Oh I'm returning this dress to Barney's.
KRAMER Good idea.
JERRY Do it tomorrow. Well go to the movies.
ELAINE Yeah yeah, ok.
KRAMER Hey look, if you're going there, maybe you could pick me up some of this super hydrating, it's a total-protection moisturizer with Uva.
ELAINE Moisturizer? That's girls stuff.
KRAMER No no, look. I'll tell you what -- they're having a sale right.
ELAINE yeah.
KRAMER I'll meetcha down there, well have lunch.
ELAINE Well we could ...
KRAMER Well, we'll get to know each other. We never get to spend any time together. Oh sure we have our little group here, but ...
GEORGE And then assuming the strike is resolved, on April 14th, we, ah, play the Angels. So let's clear a floor at the Anaheim Hotel.
ADE Anaheim Hotel. You may want to reconsider. I believe they only have room service until 10 P.M. and then it's only finger foods.
GEORGE Ade, you're a wonder.
ADE OK, now I projected some of those figures for you regarding the switch to Canola oil for the stadium popcorn and surprisingly it will only come to 1/2 a cent more per bag, so it is definitely doable.
GEORGE Ade, I have to tell you, I, I have never met anybody so ... efficient.
ADE Well thank you, I'm flattered.
GEORGE I mean you're just, you're just a marvel of organization.
ADE Well I'm just, hm, doing my job.
GEORGE It's like I'm thinking of something, and you're one step ahead of me.
ADE What can I say? I'm ... I'm good at what I do.
GEORGE Do you, uh ... do you know what I'm ... thinking about now?
ADE Yes, I think I do.
GEORGE Is it, uh, doable?
ADE It's definitely doable.
JERRY Well, that was the worst.
ELAINE I can't believe they made the Wife the killer. Gimme a break.
MAN Hey, give us a break. We haven't seen it yet. Thanks a lot big mouth!
ANOTHER_MAN Yeah!
KRAMER You got a pen?
JERRY Yeah, I think I do.
KRAMER And I need something to write on.
JERRY Well, all I got is my dry-cleaning stub.
KRAMER I gust met Uma Therman. She's giving me her telephone number. Uma Jerry, Uma.
JERRY Uma Therman? Really?
KRAMER Yeah.
ELAINE How'd you manage that.
KRAMER Yeah well I don't have any time to talk now.
JERRY He's got the Kavorca. Hey, isn't that Willie, my dry-cleaner?
ELAINE Where?
JERRY He just went in. You know, I think he was wearing my Hounds-Tooth jacket.
ELAINE What would he be doing wearing your jacket?
JERRY It looked just like the jacket I brought in to be dry-cleaned. He complimented me on it.
ELAINE Are you sure?
KRAMER I got it. Uma, Uma, Uma.
ELAINE You are amazing.
KRAMER Yeah, all right. Taxi's on me.
ADE Ah no no no no no. A better way to reach the bra would be to undo the jacket, then go around the back of the shirt.
GEORGE Ade you are incredible
ADE Oh ...oh ...oh ... Here, I want to show you something. Hand me that pillow.
GEORGE What? Oh, My God!
ADE Mr. Costanza!
GEORGE Ade, ahh, ahh, ah ... I'm giving you a raise!
JERRY So you're having sex and then all of a sudden, you just blurt out I'm giving you a raise.
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY Just a quick sidebar here -- are you in anyway authorized to give raises?
GEORGE Not that I'm aware of, no.
JERRY So you're so grateful to have sex, that you'll just shout out anything that comes into your head.
GEORGE I didn't think ahead.
JERRY Well maybe she'll just think it was bawdy talk.
GEORGE I didn't say any other bawdy things.
JERRY Maybe you could have sex with her again and then take it back.
GEORGE All right, you know you're not any help at all here. I don't know what even the point is of talking to you anymore.
JERRY All right, all right. I'm sorry.
GEORGE Yeah, well, I guess the only thing I can do is go into George Steinbrenner's office and tell him he has to give her a raise.
JERRY How long has she been there?
GEORGE 3 days.
JERRY It's almost a week.
JERRY Oh, My god.
GEORGE What?
JERRY It's a movie stub from the 9:30 show. George, I think Willie the dry-cleaner has been wearing my clothes.
ELAINE These mirrors are skinny mirrors. This is false ... reflecting. And I think, that the department of ... you know, whatever, would be very interested to know what's going on here. something else.
ELAINE OK fine. I did like that little Calvin Klein number right by the elevator. You know the little ...
ELAINE Ok thanks so much. What are you all dressed up for?
KRAMER Well Elaine, when you're shopping on Madison Avenue, you don't want to skip on the, swank.
ELAINE I like your little bag.
KRAMER Huh, oh hey, look at this. It's the super hydrating, triple-action moisturizer, hmm.
ELAINE Huh.
KRAMER Wait till that Uma smells this Uva.
BANIA Hey Kramer.
KRAMER Hey Bania, what's happening?
BANIA I'm looking for a new suit. I can't find anything I like. That's a nice suit.
KRAMER Well, thank you.
BANIA Did you get that here?
KRAMER No, this is vintage. They don't make this stuff anymore.
BANIA You're telling me.
KRAMER I sure am.
BANIA It's hard for me to find pants that
KRAMER That don't make you look high-waisted.
BANIA Yes
KRAMER Me too.
BANIA What size are you?
KRAMER Uh, 42.
BANIA 42, That's what I am now. I've been working out, I'm huge. How'd you like to sell it?
KRAMER make me an offer.
BANIA 100 Bucks
KRAMER Surely you jest.
BANIA 175
KRAMER Look at the stitching This is old world craftsmanship.
BANIA 300 dollars.
KRAMER Sold. Follow me into the dressing room.
BANIA You throw the shirt in?
KRAMER Bania, you're killing me.
BANIA Hey that's the women's dressing room.
KRAMER There's nothing in there that I haven't seen before.
GEORGE Mr. Steinbrenner, can I talk to you for a second?
STEINBRENNER Yes yes George. Can you talk to me for a second? Of course you can -- I'm a very accessible man. I just wanted to say you're doing great work on that Canola oil stuff.
GEORGE Well, you know, to be honest sir -- my, my new secretary Ade, came up with that one.
STEINBRENNER Ade, Ade, I like that name George.
GEORGE She supports her whole family.
STEINBRENNER Is that a fact George?
GEORGE Yes, In fact, her mother is in the hospital right now. It's some kind of a Diverticulitis.
STEINBRENNER I had a bout of that myself one time -- knocked me right on my ass.
GEORGE She can't even afford to go out to lunch. She's been eating in a high school cafeterias She pretends to be a teacher. It's pathetic.
STEINBRENNER What's that cost her, like, two and a quarter?
GEORGE You know what I was just thinking -- she could really use a raise.
STEINBRENNER You know, she'd be better off making a sandwich at home and bringing it in. Hello, ah, George will you excuse me.
KRAMER Psst. Hey.
ELAINE Kramer, what are you doing here?
KRAMER Listen, I need you to get me some clothes.
ELAINE What?
KRAMER Yeah, I just sold my suit to Bania for a cool three-hundred.
ELAINE So go buy a new one.
KRAMER What, at this place? It would destroy my whole profit margin.
ELAINE So.
KRAMER Listen do me a favor -- just call Jerry, tell him to bring me some clothes.
ELAINE Ouhhh
JERRY Hello, Willie.
WILLIE Hey, Jerry. You dropping off?
JERRY No, but ah, seen any good movies lately?
WILLIE You came by to ask that?
JERRY Yeah. Specifically 9:30 shows. Seen any good 9:30 shows at the Paragon, Willie?
WILLIE What are you gettin at?
JERRY I saw you the other night stepping out with my Hounds-Tooth jacket.
WILLIE Jerry that's a breach of the dry-cleaner's code.
JERRY You need a code to tell you not to wear peoples' clothes
WILLIE I wasn't wearing your jacket. Jerry you're imagining things.
JERRY Yeahhh, am I imagining this? Found this little cutie in the pocket.
WILLIE Jerry.
JERRY Yeah, Yeah. Well, now that we understand each other -- I'll be taking my business elsewhere. And I want my mother's fur coat back too.
WILLIE Jerry, come on.
JERRY Now.
WILLIE Now?
JERRY Yeah. I want that coat.
WILLIE Well ... ahh.
JERRY Where's that ticket? Oh, Kramer.
WILLIE Wait, you, you mean to tell me you don't have a ticket for the coat?
JERRY No, not on me.
WILLIE Well, I, I need to see that ticket.
JERRY Why? I've got my cleaning before without a ticket.
WILLIE Yeah, but this is different. Those fur storage warehouses are huge. You can't, get anything without a number.
JERRY All right, I'll be back.
ELAINE Yeah it looks good here, but what does that mean?
ELAINE I don't know, I have to think about it. I need a nonpartisan mirror.
ADE I can't thank you enough, Mr. Costanza. I'm so grateful
GEORGE Yes, well, I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner. I told him you have been doing great work. I said that you deserved a raise, and if you didn't get it, that I, was leaving.
ADE It was just so generous.
GEORGE Oh, well, don't worry about it -- he's got plenty of money.
ADE Oh I know, but Twenty Five Thousand.
GEORGE So you got a $25,000 a year raise.
ADE Yes, I tell you, Mr. Steinbrenner...
GEORGE You're making more than I am.
ADE I am?
GEORGE What are you doing? You're making more than I am. A secretary cannot make more than her boss.
ADE Well apparently they can.
ELAINE Oh, this is insanity. I'm not this hippie.
ELAINE Hey, what do you think of this?
MAN You'll never pull it off.
FEMALE_CUSTOMER Hey, what's going on in there?
JERRY Excuse me, could you tell me where I could find, like, women's moisturizer lotions?
FEMALE_CUSTOMER This woman has been in there for over an hour.
JERRY Kramer?
KRAMER Oh, Jerry, you got my clothes?
JERRY What clothes?
KRAMER Didn't Elaine call you?
JERRY No.
KRAMER Well what are you doing here?
JERRY What am I doing here? You're in the women's dressing room. I need that ticket stub back so I can get my mother's fur coat out.
KRAMER Oh, the stub, yeah. I left it in my, my pants
JERRY Where are your pants?
KRAMER Well, I sold them to Bania.
JERRY What? You sold your pants to Bania. Let me in.
JERRY Why'd you sell your pants to Bania?
KRAMER ouhhh -- I had Uma Therman's number written on that stub. I lost Uma's number.
JERRY Where are your clothes?
KRAMER I told you I sold them to Bania.
JERRY You mean what you were wearing?
KRAMER Yeah.
JERRY How'd you expect to get out of here?
KRAMER Well, I didn't think ahead.
ELAINE This isn't going to work for me ... so if you could show me something else.
ELAINE No?
ELAINE I am?
ELAINE Ha! That's preposterous. snow in the store.
ELAINE No. You can wrap it. Kramer, are you still in there?
JERRY 
ELAINE Jerry?
BANIA Elaine, where's Kramer?
KRAMER Bania?
BANIA Kramer.
JERRY I'm going out.
BANIA Jerry.
JERRY Bania.
BANIA Kramer, I want my money back for this suit. Your nancy-boy cream leaked all over the pockets -- suit's ruined.
KRAMER Well you're not getting any money back. Jerry, come back in here.
JERRY Excuse me.
KRAMER Uma's number is on that ticket.
JERRY Never mind Uma, I need that ticket to get my mother's fur coat back. Why don't you just give him the money for the suit?
KRAMER I'm not going to give him $300 now for a suit with moisturizer cream all over it.
JERRY I got an idea.
KRAMER What?
JERRY I can't believe I'm gonna do this.
JERRY Bania can I talk to you for a second? How's everything going?
BANIA Pretty good.
JERRY Yeah, well, see the thing of it is, I'm in a bit of an awkward position here. Because, uhh, I don't want to get in between you two guys but ... I need a dry-cleaning ticket that's in the pocket of those pants.
BANIA Well all you gotta do is tell Kramer to give me my money back, and you'll get your ticket.
JERRY Yeah, yeah all right, well uh ... tell you what I will do Bania -- you give me the ticket, and uh, I will take you out for a nice dinner.
BANIA Can we go back to Mendy's?
JERRY You want to go to Mendy's, I'll take you to Mendy's.
BANIA Twice? I wanna go twice.
JERRY All right let's be reasonable, Bania. I'm taking you out for a nice dinner. All I want is a little ticket in that pocket. I think it's a pretty good deal.
BANIA Two Mendy's.
JERRY . . . All right Just give me the ticket.
BANIA Here you go.
JERRY Ohh ...
GEORGE But Mr. Steinbrenner, how can I be expected to perform my job properly, knowing that my uh, subordinate is making more money than I am? With all due respect sir, it's outta whack.
STEINBRENNER Uh huh, I understand what you're saying George and I know what it's like to be financially strapped. When I was a young man in Cleveland I use to hitchhike to work. One time I got picked up by a bakery truck. You think that stuff smells good? Try being cooped up in the back of one of those babies.
STEINBRENNER I couldn't look at a donut for the next two years. Well not that I was ever one for the sweets.
STEINBRENNER Sure I like a cup cake every now and then, like everybody else. You know I like it when they have a little cream on the inside, it's a surprise. That's good, plus the chocolate ones are good too. Sometimes I just can't even make up my mind. A lot of times I'll mix the two together, make a vanilla fudge.
JERRY Let me in, it's me. Here. You don't know what this is costing me.
KRAMER All right, nice work. Where's Uma's number? The moisturizer smudged out the phone number.
JERRY The dry-cleaning numbers are gone too.
KRAMER It must have been the botanical extracts.
JERRY Give me that.
JERRY Hey Bania, the dinners off. The ticket's no good. The numbers are all smudged out.
BANIA You trying to get out of Mendy's? you can't do that.
JERRY The ticket is worthless.
BANIA You promised me.
JERRY Hey, Isn't that my mother's fur coat?
DONNA No it's not.
JERRY It is! Give me that back.
DONNA No, what are you talking about.
DONNA Are you out of your mind? Don't you ... take your hands ...
JERRY You can't have that coat, it's not yours.
JERRY What do you think the dry-cleaner's is your own personal closet!
ELAINE Donna, do you think you can get the salt stain out of this?
DONNA Let me see. Piece of cake. Bring it in. What size is it?
BANIA Mmm. This soup is great.
JERRY Yeah, it's very good.
BANIA I told you Mendy's had the best pea soup. The best Jerry, the best. Are you enjoying it?
JERRY Yeah. I'm having a wonderful time.
BANIA Wait till you try the swordfish. You know Jerry, I was thinking. For our next meal, do you think we should come here ... or should we go someplace else? You know it has it's pros and cons. On the one hand, here, you're guaranteed a great meal. On the other hand --
JERRY Yeah, yeah I know. This would be good, but it would be the same. But if we go some place else, it would be different, but it might not be as good. It's a gamble. I get it.
BANIA Yeah. Well, let's hurry up and eat I gotta get out of here. I'm meeting a woman for a drink.
JERRY Oh, and who might that be?
BANIA Some woman named Uma. I got her number off of that ticket before it was smudged. Hope she's good-looking.
JERRY If you are a waitress and you ever see me in a restaurant, I'm telling you right now, I don't want to hear about the specials. I don't want to know about the specials. I'm sick of the specials. I hate the specials. My feeling is, if the specials were so special, they'd be on the menu. You know what's special about them? They don't know if anybody likes them. They always have these overly creative descriptions of the specials too, you know. The veil is lightly slapped, and then sequestered in a one-bedroom suite with a white wine intravenous.
ELAINE So.. Whatley's still Jewish, huh?
JERRY Oh, sure. Without the parents, it's a breeze.
TIM Hey! Happy Chanukah!
JERRY Hey, Tim. Great party.
TIM eh?
ELAINE eh.
TIM Oh. Hey, George, thanks again for getting me those Yankee tickets.
GEORGE Oh, yeah. Still in good with the ground crew.
TIM Oh, hey, listen, I'd better circulate.. Happy Chanukah, Tiffany!
ELAINE This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah.
GEORGE I'm gonna get some more of these kosher cocktail franks..
ELAINE Oh.. I got denim vest checking me out. Fake phone number's coming out tonight.
JERRY You have a standard fake?
ELAINE Mm-hmm.
JERRY That's neat.
ELAINE No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God!
DENIM_VEST Hi!
JERRY Hi, I'm Jerry.
WOMAN Hi.
JERRY You might not know it to look at me, but I can run really, really fast.
ELAINE Nice vest. I like the.. big metal buttons
DENIM_VEST They're snaps. Listen, maybe we should, uh, go out some time?
ELAINE Why don't I give you my phone number?
GEORGE Hey.
JERRY Hey! How'd it go with the cocktail franks?
GEORGE Great! I ate the entire platter! Had to call in sick today.
JERRY Didn't you call in sick yesterday?
GEORGE Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing: "We don't care, and it shows."
JERRY You're gonna open your mail here?
GEORGE Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this. "Have you seen me?" Nope. Woah, something from Whatley.
JERRY See? You give, and you get.
GEORGE "This holiday season a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance."?
JERRY Oh, that's nice.
GEORGE I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper saying "I've given your gift to someone else!"
JERRY To a children's charity!
GEORGE Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas spirit? And eye for an eye!
ELAINE Hey!
JERRY Hey.
ELAINE Oh, nothing for me. I'm going to "Atomic Sub" later.
JERRY "Atomic Sub"? Why are you eating there?
ELAINE I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps, and I become a submarine captain.
JERRY What does that mean?
ELAINE Free sub.
ELAINE What?
GEORGE Nothing. It's a card from my dad.
ELAINE What is it? "Dear son, Happy Festivus." What is Festivus?
GEORGE It's nothing, stop it..
JERRY When George was growing up..
GEORGE Jerry, No!
JERRY His father..
GEORGE No!
JERRY Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday.
ELAINE Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place.
GEORGE Alright..
JERRY And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?
GEORGE Jerry! Stop it!
JERRY And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?
GEORGE I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! ARe you happy now?!
ELAINE Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my "Atomic Sub" card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!
JERRY So?
ELAINE I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!
JERRY No, you walk out.
ELAINE Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it.
JERRY No, you wait for the movie!
ELAINE I want that free sub.
JERRY You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, it's all computerized! They're cloning sheep now.
KRAMER No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a handkerchief on the old Dean Martin show!
JERRY So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see if he's called it?
ELAINE That's a good idea.
KRAMER Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! Bye. Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm going back to work.
JERRY What strike?
KRAMER Yeah, H&H Bagels. That's where I worked.
JERRY You?
ELAINE Worked?
JERRY Bagels?
KRAMER Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card. Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years.
ELAINE Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but I haven't seen them in a long time.
KRAMER Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity.
ELAINE What were your.. demands?
KRAMER Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now.
ELAINE I believe that's the new minimum wage.
KRAMER Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got to go.
JERRY Why didn't you ever mention this?
KRAMER Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's embarrassing!
KRAMER All right, everybody! I'm back!
MANAGER Who are you?
KRAMER Cosmo Kramer.. strikes over.
MANAGER Oh yeah! Kramer.
KRAMER Huh.. wha- Didn't any of the guys come back?
MANAGER NO, I"m sure they all got jobs.. like, ten years ago.
KRAMER Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for..
MANAGER I could use someone for the holidays..
KRAMER Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel! What are those?
MANAGER Those are rasin bagels.
KRAMER I never thought I'd live to see that..
ELAINE So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake.
BOOKIE So. You're Elaine Benes. We've been getting calls fro you for 5 years.
ELAINE So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give him my real number..
BOOKIE Hey, Charlie! Guess who's here. Elaine Benes.
CHARLIE Elaine Benes?!
BOOKIE You make a lot of man friends. You know who's a man? Charlie here, he's a man. You know who else? Me. I'm a man.
CHARLIE I'm a man.
ELAINE Ohh.. my..
BOOKIE I'll have this best guy call your real number. You just, uh, give it to me. And that way, I'll have it.
ELAINE My number? Ohh.. Okay.. Uh, well, there you go. And, uh, tell you what.. put a sawbuck on Captain Nemo in the third at Belmont.
TIM Hey, Jerry.
JERRY Hey, Tim.
TIM What's up?
JERRY Actually, I'm having dinner with a girl I met at your party.
TIM Mazel Tov.
GWEN Jerry.. hi.
JERRY Gwen?
GWEN Yeah.
JERRY Really?
GWEN Yeah! Come on, our table is ready.
GEORGE So, attractive one day - not attractive the next?
JERRY Have you come across this?
GEORGE Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome -- she's a two-face.
JERRY Like the Batman villain?
GEORGE If that helps you..
JERRY So, if I ask her out again - I don't know who's showing up: The good, the bad, or the ugly.
GEORGE Clint Eastwood!
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE Hey, check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley.
JERRY "A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund." - What is that?
GEORGE Made it up.
JERRY "The Human Fund. Money for people."
GEORGE What do you think?
JERRY It has a certain understated stupidity.
GEORGE The Outlaw of Josey Whales!
JERRY ..Yeah.
KRAMER Ah, gentlemen.. bagels on the house!
JERRY How was your first day?
KRAMER Oh, fantastic! It felt so good to get my hands back in taht dough.
JERRY Your hands were in the dough?
KRAMER No, I didn't make these bagels. Yeah, they're day-olds. The homeless won't even touch them. Oh, we try to fool them by putting a few fresh ones on top, but they dig.. they, they test.
GEORGE Alright. Uh, well, I'm out of here.
JERRY Happy Festivus!
KRAMER What's Festivus?
JERRY When George was growing up..
GEORGE No!
JERRY His father..
GEORGE Stop it! It's nothing. It's a stupid holiday my father invented. It doesn't exist!
ELAINE Happy Festivus, Georgie.
KRAMER Frank invented a holiday? He's so prolific!
ELAINE Kramer, listen, I got a little phone relay going, so, if a guy calls H&H and he's looking for me, you take a message.
JERRY You're still trying to gget that free sub?
ELAINE Hey! I have spent a lot of time, and I have eaten a lot of crap to get to where I am today. And I am not throwing it all away now.
JERRY Is there a captain's hat involved in this?
ELAINE Maybe.
FRANK Kramer, I got your message. I haven't celebrated Festivus in years! What is your interest?
KRAMER Well, just tell me everything, huh?
FRANK Many Christmases ago, I went to buy a doll for my son. I reach for the last one they had - but so did another man. As I rained blows opon him, I realized there had to be another way!
KRAMER What happened to the doll?
FRANK It was destroyed. But out of that, a new holiday was born. "A Festivus for the rest of us!"
KRAMER That musta been some kind of doll.
FRANK She was.
GEORGE Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas! Oh, Sandy! Here is a little something for you..
SANDY ..Oh.. thanks.
GEORGE Phil, I loved those cigars! Incoming!
PHIL Ow!
GEORGE Aw, Mr. Kruger, Sir. Merry Christmas!
KRUGER Not if you could see our books.. what's this?
GEORGE The Human Fund.
KRUGER Whatever.
GEORGE Exactly. Erica!
FRANK And at the Festivus dinner, you gather your family around, and you tell them all the ways they have disappointed you over the past year.
KRAMER Is there a tree?
FRANK No. Instead, there's a pole. It requires not decoration. I find tinsel distracting.
KRAMER Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch.
FRANK Let's do it then! Festivus is back! I'll get the pole out of the crawl space.
ELAINE Hello, Frank.
FRANK Hello, woman.
ELAINE Kramer! Kramer.. any word from the vest?
KRAMER No. Ah, listen, Harry, I need the 23rd off.
MANAGER Hey! I hired you to work during the holidays. This is the holidays.
KRAMER But it's Festivus.
MANAGER What?
KRAMER You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays..
MANAGER That's not a right.
KRAMER Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. Come on Elaine. It's a walk out!
ELAINE No, I got to stay here and wait for the call.
KRAMER What? You're siding with management?!
ELAINE No, I just..
KRAMER Scab! Scab! Scab!
GWEN Hey.
JERRY Boy, am I glad to see you.
GWEN You were expecting someone else?
JERRY You never know.
GWEN You know, you might want to take the tunnel.
JERRY So, uh, what do you feel like eating? Chinese or Italian?
GWEN I can go either way.
JERRY You're telling me.
GEORGE So, she was switching? Back and forth?
JERRY Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that back booth over there.
GEORGE So, just bring her here. This is all you really need.
JERRY I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress?
GEORGE Lights out.
JERRY Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee shop. Nice cuff links, by the way.
GEORGE Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this Human Fund is a gold mine!
JERRY That's not a french cuff shirt, you know.
GEORGE I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter opener.
JERRY Oh, that's classy.
KRAMER Well, Happy Festivus.
GEORGE What is that? Is taht the pole?!
FRANK George, Festivus is your heritage - it's part of who you are.
GEORGE That's why I hate it.
KRAMER There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's invited.
FRANK George, you're forgetting how much Festivus has meant to us all. I brought one of the casette tapes.
FRANK Read that poem.
GEORGE I can't read it. I need my glasses!
FRANK You don't need glasses, you're just weak! You're weak!
ESTELLE Leave him alone!
FRANK Alright, George. It's time for the feats of strength.
GEORGE No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength! I hate Festivus!
FRANK We had some good times.
GWEN Hey.
JERRY I there. This is Kramer, and Frank.
GWEN Hi.
KRAMER Hello.
GWEN So, you ready to go?
JERRY Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up. Now this is a good looking booth.
KRAMER Protect Festivus! Hey, no bagels, no bagels, no bagels,
MANAGER Lady, if you want a sandwich, I'll make you a sandwich.
ELAINE I want the one that I earned. I'll get it. I'll get it! H&H, and Elaine.
KRAMER Elaine, you should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. It's going down.
ELAINE What did you do?
KRAMER You've been warned.
ELAINE Oh, hi!
WORKER Hey, the steam valve's broke.
MANAGER Can we still make bagels?
WORKER Sure. It's just a little steamy.
KRAMER Hey! How do you like your bagels now?!
KRUGER George, I got something for you. I'm suppose to find a charity and throw some of the company's money at it. They all seem the same to me, so, what's the difference?
GEORGE 20 thousand dollars?
KRUGER Made out to the Human Fund. Oh, damn. I've locked myself out of my office again. Oh well. I'm going home.
GWEN Jerry, how many times do we have to come to this.. place?
JERRY Why? It's our place.
GWEN I just found a rubber band in my soup.
JERRY Oh.. I know who's cooking today!
GEORGE Hey! Surprise, surprise!
JERRY Hey, Georgie!
GWEN I think I'm just gonna go.
JERRY I'll be here.
GEORGE Hey, soup.
JERRY She didn't touch it.
GEORGE Ohh.. Paco! Hey, take a look at this.
JERRY 20 thousand dollars from Kruger? You're not keeping this.
GEORGE I don't know.
JERRY Excuse me?
GEORGE I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance to start giving something back.
JERRY You want to give something back? Start with the 20 thousand dollars.
GEORGE I'm serious.
JERRY You're going to start your own charity?
GEORGE I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they would come to me.. and beg! And if I felt like it, I would help them out. And then they would owe me big time! .. First thing I'm gonna need is a driver..
ELAINE Kramer, the vest just called.
KRAMER Yama - Hama! It's fright night!
ELAINE Oh, yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in 10 minutes, I'm gonna have my hands on that "Atomic Sub" card.
KRAMER And?
ELAINE Free sub. I'll see ya.
KRAMER Yeah.
GWEN Kramer, Hi!
KRAMER Oh, hello.
GWEN It's Gwen.. We met .. at the coffee shop.
KRAMER Ah-huh.
GWEN I'm dating your friend, Jerry..
KRAMER Ahh.. I don't know who you really are, but I've seen Jerry's girlfriend, and she's not you. You're much better looking - and like, a foot taller.
GWEN That's why we're always hiding in that coffee shop! He's afraid of getting caught.
KRAMER Oh, he's a tomcat.
ELAINE Steve.
DENIM_VEST Hmm?
ELAINE It's Elaine.
DENIM_VEST From Tim Whatley's party?
ELAINE Yeah.
DENIM_VEST You look.. different.
ELAINE I see you're still sticking with the denim. Do you have that card that I gave you?
DENIM_VEST Well, I had it back at my place, but I can't go there now.. I'll give it to you later, or something.
ELAINE No, no, no. You give me your number.
DENIM_VEST Okay. Sure. Do you have the mumps?
ELAINE No.
DENIM_VEST Typhoid?
ELAINE No.
DENIM_VEST Yama - Hama!
ELAINE A fake number! Blimey!
KRUGER George, we have a problem. There's a memo, here, from accounting telling me there's no such thing as the Human Fund.
GEORGE Well, there could be.
KRUGER But there isn't.
GEORGE Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here.
KRUGER George, I don't get it. If there's no Human Fund, those donation cards were fake. You better have a damn good reason why you gave me a fake Christmas gift.
GEORGE Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus.
KRUGER Vemonous?
GEORGE Festivus, Sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir!
KRUGER Are you making all this up, too?
GEORGE Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove it - if I had to.
KRUGER Yeah, you probably should.
GEORGE Happy Festivus!
FRANK George? This is a surprise. Who's the suit?
GEORGE Yo, dad. This is my boss, Mr. Kruger.
FRANK Have you seen the pole, Kruger?
GEORGE Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole.
FRANK He's gonna see it.
GEORGE Happy Festivus! Yama - Hama!
ELAINE I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here?
GEORGE Embracing my roots.
JERRY They nailed you on the 20 G's?
GEORGE Busted cold.
FRANK It's made from aluminum. Very high strength-to-weight ratio.
KRUGER I find your belief system fascinating.
KRAMER Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone! Hee, hee, hee!
BOOKIE Hello again, Miss Benes.
ELAINE What are you doing here?
BOOKIE Damnedest thing.. me and Charlie were calling to ask you out, and, uh, we got this bagel place..
KRAMER I told them I was just about to see you.. It's a Festivus miracle!
ESTELLE Dinner's ready!
FRANK Let's begin. Dr.. Van Nostrand?
KRAMER Uh.. that's right.
FRANK Welcome, new comers. The tradition of Festivus begins with the airing of grievances. I got a lot of problems with you people! And now you're gonna hear about it! You, Kruger. My son tells me your company stinks!
GEORGE Oh, God.
FRANK Quiet, you'll get yours in a minute. Kruger, you couldn't smooth a silk sheet if you had a hot date with a babe.. I lost my train of thought.
GWEN Jerry!
JERRY Gwen! How'd you know I was here?
GWEN Kramer told me.
KRAMER Another Festivus miracle!
GWEN I guess this is the ugly girl I've been hearing about.
ELAINE Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. Give me a break.
JERRY Gwen. Gwen, wait! Ah! Bad lighting on the porch.
ELAINE Hey, how'd my horse do?
BOOKIE He had to be shot.
FRANK And now as Festivus rolls on, we come to the feats of strength.
GEORGE Not the feats of strength..
FRANK This year, the honor goes to Mr. Kramer.
KRAMER Uh-oh. Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to work a double shift at H&H.
JERRY I thought you were on strike?
KRAMER Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little out there.
GEORGE Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength?
KRUGER How about George?
FRANK Good thinking, Kruger. Until you pin me, George, Festivus is not over!
GEORGE Oh, please, somebody, stop this!
FRANK Let's rumble!
ESTELLE I think you can take him, Georgie!
GEORGE Oh, come on! Be sensible.
FRANK Stop crying, and fight your father!
GEORGE Ow! .. Ow! I give, I give! Uncle!
FRANK This is the best Festivus ever!
MANAGER Alright. That's enough. You're fired.
KRAMER Thank - you!
JERRY I'm not a foodie. I don't, "Oh, this is too rare. Oh, it's too salty." Just eat it and shut up. I'll eat anywhere, whatever they're having. I have eaten rotten rolls off of room service trays in hotel hallways. I have. It's not a joke. This is my life. I don't know, somebody left it. Why would someone poison a roll, and leave it in a hallway for some comic coming down at two o' clock in the morning? Why would they do that? Sometimes you go to a nice restaurant, they put the check in a little book. What is this? The story of the bill? "Once upon a time, there were some very hungry people.." What is this? A little gold tassle hanging down? Am I graduating from the restaurant? What is this about?
ELAINE Do you want some of mine?
JERRY Take some of mine.
GEORGE Why do I get pesto? Why do I think I'll like it? I keep trying to like it, like I have to like it.
JERRY Who said you have to like it?
GEORGE Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto.
JERRY I don't like pesto.
GEORGE Where was pesto 10 years ago?
JERRY Look at that guy. I'll bet you he's gettin' hair transplants. Any time you see a guy that age wearing a baseball cap, ten to one - plugs.
ELAINE The thing about that painting.. is with the colors and um.. Oh yeah, plugola.
JERRY Oh, one more thing about the car. Let it warm up for a minute.
GEORGE That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work.
JERRY I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab.
GEORGE Who?
JERRY Elaine is having a "houseguest." She's picking him up at the airport tonight.
GEORGE A guy?
ELAINE Yes, a guy.
JERRY He's from a.. Yakima, right?
ELAINE Seattle.
JERRY Everybody's moving to Seattle.
GEORGE It's the pesto of cities. So..?
ELAINE You tell him.
JERRY Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met a gentleman.
ELAINE Ed.
JERRY Who was in town on a business venture, and um..
ELAINE ..We shared an interpersonal experience. Go on.
JERRY So they went out a few times, but apparently, when the fellow returned home, he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash off so easily.
ELAINE On some people.
GEORGE Oooh.
JERRY So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week.
ELAINE It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became a week.
MANAGER What happened?
GEORGE Oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle.
MANAGER Sorry to the disturbance.
ELAINE I'm never eating here again.
JERRY Nice going. Thank you, that ought to get us a free dessert.. I think the busboy's in trouble.
GEORGE Did I get him in trouble? Because of what I said?! I just told him what happened.. he didn't do it on purpose.. He pointed at me. Why did he point at me?!
ELAINE I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had to know I was kidding.
JERRY I didn't say anything.
GEORGE I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!
ELAINE Oh, I said it in a kidding way.
GEORGE I didn't know he'd get fired.
JERRY He'll probably kill his family over this.
GEORGE What if he's waiting for me outside? He pointed at me! Did you see him point?!
JERRY A lot of ex-cons become busboys. They seem to gravitate twards 'em.
GEORGE Was it my fault?
ELAINE Was it my fault?
JERRY ..Maybe I'll try that pesto.
JERRY Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of grueling interviews.
GEORGE Oh, like you really know busboys.
JERRY Oh, like you do.
GEORGE Hey, at least I was a camp waiter.
JERRY Camp.
GEORGE It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me.
JERRY Elaine?
ELAINE Yeah.
JERRY Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs.
GEORGE Then why don't you try and get him another job?
JERRY I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins.
ELAINE I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am one clever chickadee.
GEORGE What? Did you get the busboy's number?
ELAINE His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D. Now, I did my job. May I have the car keys, please?
GEORGE How did you get all this?
ELAINE Does the word "charm" mean anything to you?
JERRY No. So now you're going to his apartment? I really think this is nuts.
GEORGE I'd like to apologize. I want to tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble.
JERRY You, you're going now?
GEORGE Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something.
JERRY Maybe the fat camp. You're not going?
ELAINE I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport.
JERRY I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till after my set?
GEORGE It'll take to long.
JERRY Take the K-man. A little support..
GEORGE I don't a..
KRAMER Take me where? Where?
GEORGE Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't mind - try not to say too much.
KRAMER What am I gonna say?
GEORGE I don't know.
KRAMER Well, I'm not an idiot.
GEORGE Certainly not.
KRAMER Then we're cool.
GEORGE Yeah.. yeah, we're - we're cool. Uh, I'm sorry to bother you, I was in the restaurant earlier and I was wondering if I could talk to you for a few minutes about what happened. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. It's just that I think I may have - without realizing it - been responsible for getting you fired. And.. and.. and I just want you to know that I didn't intend for that to happen.
KRAMER He's a hell of a guy.
GEORGE This is a guy I know.. Kramer.
KRAMER Habla espanol?
GEORGE Oh my God.
ANTONIO Si.
KRAMER Como se dice.. waterbed?
GEORGE Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll certainly be glad to do that. Well, I guess that's about it.
KRAMER You got anything to drink? Agua?
GEORGE Oy uy uy.. We really should get going.
KRAMER Let me get a glass of water.
GEORGE Hurry up.
ANTONIO Pequita? Pequita?
KRAMER His cat's gone.
ANTONIO La puerta esta abierta. La puerta esta abierta! Who left the door open? Who left the door open?! Come on, come on! Help me look!
KRAMER ..You know, cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt, she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never know. They got things in their brains where they remember where they're from. Unless, of course, somebody else starts feeding him. See, that's what you gotta worry about.
GEORGE Once again, Antonio, I can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything. The job, the cat.. the lamp.
KRAMER The wire was sticking out.. Yeah.
GEORGE Here's my card. I'm in real estate, so, if you're ever looking for something bigger, something nicer.. ..maybe not right now. Anyway..
KRAMER You oughta get that wire fixed. I got the door.
JERRY George, stop worrying about this guy. It wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey. He doesn't even know where you live.. Who told you to give him your business card?.. That's Elaine. Kramer.. George wants to know when you want to look for the cat again.
KRAMER It's been a week. It's up to the cat now.
JERRY Kramer says it's up to the cat now. It'll be on your conscience.
KRAMER Oh? How do you figure?
JERRY How do you figure? 'Cause you're the one who left the door open.
KRAMER Why was I in charge of closing the door?
JERRY Why was he in charge of closing the door? 'Cause you came in after him!
KRAMER So!
JERRY So! So, the last person in should close the door!
KRAMER Let me talk to him.
JERRY Talk - call him from your house. He's calling you now.. okay.
ELAINE Ed's downstairs. CAn I have the car keys?
JERRY No hello?
ELAINE Got any asprin? Hello. Now, lookit, you guarantee this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems?
JERRY Guarantee? ..Hey, it's a car.
ELAINE Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him, and everyone who tries to stop me.
JERRY So, did you have a nice week together?
ELAINE I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that ping?
JERRY There's no ping. Why are you so wacky?
ELAINE Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful guy, but I hate his guts!
JERRY So, you two been, uh..
ELAINE No! I told him I've been having my period for the last five days! I'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. But, I've only got fourteen hours to go. Nothing can go wrong now. I think I've taken care of everything. I've confirmed the plane reservation. I've checked the weather..
JERRY What's your airport route?
ELAINE I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel.
JERRY ..What about the Van Wyck?
ELAINE I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.
JERRY Oooh.
ELAINE Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 10:15. We're getting up at about eight. That gives us enough time, right?
JERRY You still using that old alarm clock?
ELAINE Oh, no, no. I bought a new one today. It's got everything - it's got everything... If you oversleep more than ten minutes, a hand comes out and slaps you in the face.
JERRY Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're getting on the plane, if you miss that plane, there's no alternative. On the ground, you have options. You have buses, you have taxis, you have trains. But, when you're taking a flight, if you miss it, that's it. No airline goes, "Well, you missed the flight, we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes. Would you be interested in that? It's not a direct cannon, you have to change cannons after you land." "I'm sorry, where you goin'? Chicago? Oh, Dallas? Alright, wait a second.. Dallas. That's about Dallas. Texas, anyway. You should hit Texas. Are you ready? Make sure you get out of the net immediately, because we shoot the luggage in right after you." 15 - they overslept. She gets frantic
ELAINE Get up! The alarm clock didn't go off! It's 9:15! You're gonna miss the plane! It's 9:15!
ED 9:15?
ELAINE Yes! 9:15!
ED We'll never make it. I'll leave tomarrow.
ELAINE Tomarrow?! Are you crazy? No, now, now! Let's go! You get dressed! Get dressed!
ED Can I shower?
ELAINE Shower?! ARe you out of your mind?!
ED I gotta shower. I'll feel dirty all day.
ELAINE Forget the shower! The shower's out. Move it! Put your clothes on! Put your clothes on! Where are you going?
ED The kitchen.
ELAINE The kitchen?!
ED I've got a bag of cashews in there.
ELAINE They're not making it! Let's get your pants on!
ED What's the big deal if we don't make it? I'll just go tomarrow or the next day.
ELAINE No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!
ED I'll never make it.
ELAINE Don't say that!
ED But it takes forty-five minutes to get there. That'll only leave me five minutes to get to the plane.
ELAINE Shut up and pack!
ED And what if I don't make the plane? You'll have already left. Then what will I do?
ELAINE You're talking too much!
ED Where's my sweater?
ELAINE What?!
ED My brown sweater.
ELAINE What? What sweater?
ED My brown sweater.
ELAINE You didn't bring a brown sweater.
ED I brought a brown sweater.
ELAINE Here! Here! You want a brown sweater?! You got a brown sweater!
ED That's not mine. I can't take your sweater.
ELAINE It's brown!
ED What are you doing?!
ELAINE No time for folding.. I think that's it.
ED My shoes. You packed my shoes.
ELAINE Shoes? Shoes?! Shoes?! Shoes weren't invented till the fourth century! People walked around for thousands of years without them! I got this. Let's go!
JERRY Anywhere in the city?
GEORGE Anywhere in the city - I'll tell you the best public toilet.
JERRY Okay.. Fifty-fourth and Sixth?
GEORGE Sperry Rand Building. 14th floor, Morgan Apparel. Mention my name - she'll give you the key.
JERRY Alright.. Sixty-fifth and Tenth.
GEORGE ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, the Met. Magnificent facilities.
ELAINE I never new I could drive like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in slow motion. I was seeing three and four moves ahead, weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold metal run. I knew I was challenging the very laws of physics. At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue, I used the median. I had it. I was there.. and then.. I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's ever beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen, I tell you this - I came as close as anyone ever has. And if it hadn't been for that five-car-pile-up on Rockaway Boulevard, that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs.
KRAMER ..The busboy's coming! The busboy's coming!
GEORGE The busboy's coming?
JERRY You don't mean here?
KRAMER Yeah. I just buzzed him in. He's on his way up..
GEORGE He's coming up?! I'll check you out later.
JERRY Where are you going?
GEORGE I'm the one he wants! He's coming to settle the score.
JERRY No. You three all know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game.
KRAMER No, he's not going to do anything. I guarantee it.
GEORGE Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me. I..
KRAMER Antonio. In here!
GEORGE Hey, Antonio. How's it going?
ANTONIO Three nights ago, a gas main beneath the restaurant exploded, killing five people in my section, including the busboy who replaced me. If I am not fired that night because of you and your thoughtless, stupid, insensitive remarks, it would have been me. You saved my life.
GEORGE Ah, come on..
ELAINE Yeah?
ED It's Eddie.
ELAINE He's coming up. He's coming up..
ANTONIO And that very same night of the accident, while looking for Pequita, I found a job in a restaurant where they pay me almost twice what I was making before - and when I returned to the apartment, Pequita, perhaps frightened from the explosion, had miraculously returned. Well, but now, I must go, for today I am starting my new and wonderful job. And I am very late. Thank you, thank you, thank you all.
ED Hey, watch were you're going. You almost knocked my head off!
ANTONIO Hey, why don't you watch where you're going, okay? 'Cause you bumped into me!
ED Who do you think you're talking to, pal?
ANTONIO Hey, get your hands off me!
ED Go to hell!
JERRY He'll get another job. He's a busboy!
GEORGE It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast comes off.
JERRY It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.
GEORGE That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with his knee.
ELAINE Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio. ..Thanks.
GEORGE So, much longer?
ELAINE Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can feed himself?
GEORGE I guess it's not important.
ELAINE Take care of yourselves.
GEORGE I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy.
JERRY Yeah.. How ya doing?
JERRY First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight. People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we have boxing either. It's really kind of an amazing thing. To me, the problem with boxing is - you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument. Why don't they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars, drive around a bit, have a little accident? They get out, "Didn't you see my signal?" "Look at that fender!" ..Then you'd see a real fight.
GEORGE I-I've given this a lot of thought. I'm sorry, but we, uh, we have to break up.
MAURA No.
MAURA We're not breaking up.
MAURA No.
GEORGE She said no.
JERRY What did you do?
GEORGE What could I do? We fooled around and went to a movie.
JERRY George, both parties don't have to consent to a breakup. It's not like you're launching missiles from a submarine and you both have to turn your keys. Obviously, you didn't make a convincing case. Let me hear your arguments.
GEORGE Well, I don't really like her.
JERRY That's good.
GEORGE I don't find her attractive.
JERRY Solid.
GEORGE I'd like to sleep with a lot of other women.
JERRY Always popular.
GEORGE Sometimes at restaurants she talks to her food. 'Oh, Mr. Mashed Potatoes, you are so good.'
JERRY You have an airtight case.
GEORGE And in bed--
JERRY I'm afraid we're out of time.
GEORGE What?
JERRY Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks that he actually wore in the movie Cinderfella. I got 'em at an auction.
GEORGE I got some cufflinks I could've loaned you.
JERRY No, Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this Friar's Club roast I'm goin' to next week. Now I have an in to strike up a conversation with him.
GEORGE You already have an in. You have the same first name. Jerry.
JERRY Oh, that'll intrigue him.
GEORGE Well, it worked when I met George Peppard last week.
JERRY George Peppard has been dead for years.
GEORGE Well, whoever he was, he knew a lot about The A-Team. based on the method of execution?
ELAINE Right, right. I mean, if I was getting the chair, I'd go for something hot and spicy. You know, thai, maybe Mexican. Lethal injection, feels like pasta. You know, painless, don't want anything to heavy.
GLENN So, um, why don't we get together some time?
ELAINE Oh, sure. Why don't you give me your number?
GLENN I think it'd be better if I called you.
ELAINE Oh. OK. Maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. Do-do you work around here?
GLENN Mmmm... no, not really.
ELAINE So, is there anything you can tell me about yourself?
GLENN I think you're very beautiful.
ELAINE Oh, ha ha. That'll do. I haven't talked to him in, like, three weeks. I think it might be over.
JERRY So, what's this guy about?
ELAINE I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, where he worked. I'll be he's in a relationship.
JERRY Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity. Elaine, you could be dating the Green Lantern!
ELAINE Which one is he?
JERRY Green suit, power ring.
ELAINE I don't care for jewellery on men.
KRAMER Hey. It happened again. Another robbery in the building.
JERRY So you bought a cooler?
KRAMER It's a strongbox to protect my irreplacables.
ELAINE And... what would those be?
KRAMER Some taxidermy that's been in my family for generations. My Tony, my... military discharge.
JERRY You were in the Army?
KRAMER Briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this key. Because if somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions.
ELAINE Literally.
KRAMER 'Literally'? What's that supposed to mean? You mind if I hide this somewhere?
JERRY No, go ahead.
JERRY Oh, come on!
KRAMER Come on, Jerry, this is a security issue. Boy, you wouldn't last a day in the Army.
KRAMER Well, that's classified.
JERRY Kramer?
ELAINE No, the Green Lantern.
KRAMER ok
ELAINE Well, I don't know. I may never marry. It might be the closest I get.
KRAMER You peeked!
JERRY This is your hiding place?!
KRAMER It was under a spoon! officially broken up. Thank you, and good night.
MAURA No, George, we're not.
GEORGE But I proved it!
MAURA I refuse to give up on this relationship. It's like launching missiles from a submarine. Both of use have to turn our keys.
GEORGE Well, then, I am gonna have to ask you to turn your key.
MAURA I'm sorry, George, I can't do that.
GEORGE Turn your key, Maura. Turn your key!
ELAINE So, how is a guy like you notinvolved?
GLENN Well, I might ask you the same thing.
ELAINE_MIND That's true, maybe he's not married.
ELAINE Oh, that is so sweet.
ELAINE_MIND How long do I have to hold this?
ELAINE Who is it? me show you a short cut. Come on.
ELAINE_MIND Married. That's it, I'm chucking the flower.
ELAINE "Jerry! Jerry!"Jerry, looking down from his window:
JERRY Elaine, what are you doin' down there?
ELAINE You didn't hear me buzzing?
JERRY Oh, I guess it's broken.
ELAINE Throw down your key.
JERRY It's liable to bounce and go into a sewer.
ELAINE I'll catch it!
JERRY You'll chicken out at the last second.
ELAINE Yeah, you're right.
ELAINE All right. Well, will you at least keep me company until somebody comes out?
JERRY All right.
JERRY Hey, you know what's weird?
ELAINE Huh?
JERRY I used to be able to have a huge meal, go right to sleep. But I can't anymore.
ELAINE Nodding off!
ELAINE Well, I was right. He's an adulterer. And he's cheating on his wife with me.
ELAINE I'm hungry. Can you throw something down?
JERRY All right. Here! I'm gonna try and fix the buzzer.
ELAINE It went in the sewer!
JERRY Hey
KRAMER What are you doing?
JERRY You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom!
KRAMER You just had to go lookin' for it, didn't you? See, you hate it that I have a little secret. Anything I do -- oooh, oooh! -- you gotta know everything about it. You're so obsessed with me.
JERRY I'm going to let Elaine in.
KRAMER What are you doing with her?
JERRY Kramer!
KRAMER Security issue!
JERRY Oh hey, you got in.
ELAINE Yeah, flirted with the menu guy.
JERRY Oh, thanks.
KRAMER That wasn't me!
JERRY So, he's definitely married, huh?
ELAINE Yeah...
JERRY Boy, I would've loved to have been there when you told him off.
ELAINE Hmm...
JERRY Oh, come on!
ELAINE Well, he could be a superhero! You should've seen him run.
KRAMER All right, Jerry. Let's see if you can get it in your head that this is not an Easter egg hunt for your childish amusement.
GEORGE Jerry!
JERRY George, the buzzer's broken! I'll come down! I believe this belongs to you.
KRAMER Heyyyy!
JERRY Where did you get that?
GEORGE I bought it.
PHIL Thanks.
JERRY I'm sorry, I I don't know you.
PHIL What?
JERRY There's been some robberies in the building. I-I can't let you in.
PHIL But, I live here. I ran out to get some birdseed, and-and I forgot my key.
GEORGE Sounds like a scam.
JERRY Very sorry.
GEORGE So I broke up with Maura
JERRY Great, you're lonely and miserable again.
GEORGE Feels right.
JERRY Is that guy still there?
GEORGE He's staring at us
JERRY Don't look at him. We don't hear that.
GEORGE Want a bite?
JERRY No, I don't.
GEORGE_MIND I think that ginger ale at the coffee shop is just Coke and Sprite mixed together. How can I prove it? Ah! Can't, dammit.
MAURA Hey honey.
GEORGE What? M-Maura, what are you doin' here? I ended this relationship, twice.
MAURA George, you didn't mean that. That was just a fight.
GEORGE Why does it only seem like I'm the only one working at this breakup?
MAURA George, I listened to your arguments, and they were rambling and flimsy. I'm not convinced. Come on, get dressed and let's get some dinner.
GEORGE All right.
MAURA Eww, Mr. Apple. You have a brown spot.
ELAINE So, this is yourlittle... love nest?
GLENN It's nothing special, just a little place I keep.
ELAINE Oh.
GLENN Ah, should I light a fire?
ELAINE Oh, that sounds romantic.
GLENN I'm having a little problem withthe heat. Uh, I got some cardboard out here.
ELAINE_MIND This is wrong. I should go.
GLENN Can you get that, please?
ELAINE Oh, sure.
LADY Where's Glenn?
ELAINE You're the woman from the street, and I am so sorry. You know, I'm not really a home-wrecker. I-I-I-I thought he was a superhero. I swear.
LADY Lady, I'm not his wife, I'm his welfare caseworker. Is he home?
ELAINE This is his home?
LADY Yes.
ELAINE So, he's...
LADY Poor.
GLENN I think this will burn!
JERRY So you do live here.
PHIL Yeah.
JERRY You live on this floor?
PHIL Yeah.
JERRY So you live right... there.
PHIL Yeah.
JERRY So I guess I'll see--
ELAINE He wouldn't give me his number because hedoesn't have a phone. He's not married. He's poor.
JERRY Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels, with the straps?
ELAINE He probably busted it up and burned it for heat.
JERRY So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers?
ELAINE How can I end it over money? I feel bad.
JERRY Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other situation?
ELAINE Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage cans.
JERRY Good. How did you handle that?
ELAINE Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes in the alley across the street.
JERRY Same situation. Pay him off, and you're clean.
ELAINE Well, I am not paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship. Wh-what am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand him... well, how much do you think it would be?
GEORGE Hey.
JERRY Hey, where have you been?
GEORGE Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt.
ELAINE If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things would have been so much simpler.
GEORGE Who's this, Blue Arrow?
ELAINE Green Lantern.
JERRY We found out his super power was lack of money.
ELAINE All right.
JERRY He's invulnerable to creditors.
ELAINE We get it.
JERRY He's the 'Got-no-Green' Lantern.
ELAINE Thank you.
JERRY Hey, Elaine. Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan.
ELAINE Well crafted.
GEORGE Hey, maybe this cheating thing is what I could use to ditch Maura.
JERRY Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair. George, now on the same side as the booth of Jerry, with Elaine's side
GEORGE She's like a district attorney. If it's not the truth, I'll break under the cross. I actually have to do it.
JERRY Could you move over there?
GEORGE Hey, you know, there's this secretary at work that always had a crush on me.
JERRY Really? How come you never pursued her before?
GEORGE She's too tan. It's the middle of the winter, she's like a carrot.
ELAINE Did I leave my glasses here?
JERRY He can wipe out his checking account in a single bound!
ELAINE Keep em
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY There's a giant parrot in the hallway.
KRAMER It's Phil's.
JERRY Who?
KRAMER Our neighbor that you turned against. Anyway, I told him it'd be fine with us if he wanted to let it stretch its wings out in the hallway.
JERRY What'd ya tell him that for?
KRAMER Because since you've been playing God with the front door, I've been tryin' to smooth things out, Jerry. In fact, I was just hanging out at his place.
JERRY Really? What's it like? Is it nicer than mine? Where does he have the couch?
KRAMER Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved. I hid it at Phil's
JERRY He let you?
KRAMER No, he doesn't know. So, uh, Phil won't be compulsively looking for it like some people. You!
GEORGE So, you, you say you've been in the city all winter?
LORETTA I was in Maine for a couple days.
GEORGE Well... here we are.
LORETTA George, I've always fantasized about jumping into bed with you.
GEORGE Ho ho!
LORETTA But... I don't want to spoil things by sleeping with you too soon.
GEORGE Are you sure? 'Cause it could really help me out of a jam.
LORETTA I want to build something with you, George.
GEORGE Oh, not more building.
LORETTA And I won't take no for an answer.
GEORGE No?
LORETTA No.
GEORGE All right.
ELAINE So what are we doing in this alley anyway?
GLENN It's a surprise.
ELAINE Oh.
ELAINE What are you doing? What is that?
GLENN It's a bag of donuts.
ELAINE It's garbage.
GLENN No, no, no, no, no, When they make the new ones, the old ones come out right here.
ELAINE All right, that's it. How do you spell your last name?
GLENN It's a bear claw! You have no idea how rare this is.
ELAINE I'll make it out to cash. How 'bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty?
GLENN Mmmm!
ELAINE Make it three hundred.
GLENN You know Elaine, you are the bear claw in the garbage can of my life.
ELAINE Aw, Glenn.
JERRY Hi, is Phil there?
PHIL Yes I'm here.
JERRY Phil... hi. I-I know we kind of got off to a bad start. But your bird, which is lovely, by the way, made a mess on my door.
PHIL And?
JERRY I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid, there.
PHIL That's my wife.
JERRY All right, I think we're done here.
JERRY So, you're in a relationship with a woman you don't like, and you're having an affair with a woman who won't have sex with you.
GEORGE This isn't going well.
JERRY I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks. Without 'em, I have no in!
GEORGE You don't need the cufflinks. You have the samename. Jerry!
JERRY Where are you goin'? Help me look.
GEORGE It's a big night. I'm, uh, ice skating with one, and going to a staged reading of Godspell with the other.
JERRY Which is with who?
GEORGE It doesn't matter.
KRAMER Whoo! Boy. Yeah, youclean up nice.
JERRY I can't go until I find my cufflinks.
KRAMER Yeah, see? I knew you would lose 'em. That's why I took 'em out of your dresser drawer and put 'em in my strongbox.
JERRY You're a lifesaver. Would you get them, please?
KRAMER Yeah, we'll stop by Phil's, we'llpick up the key.
KRAMER Hey, what's going on?
PHIL Fredo is dead.
JERRY That strange Portuguese guy that lives next-door to the incinerator?
PHIL No! my bird. We just got back from the pet cemetery.
JERRY Oh, Phil. Mrs. Phil. I'm so sorry.
PHIL Oh, I'll bet you are! They told us he was poisoned! Something in his food.
JERRY But I, I didn't--
JERRY Kramer, they think I killed Fredo! And who buries a bird?
KRAMER Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese guy, and he... puts it in the incinerator.
JERRY Just get the key and let's get out here.
KRAMER You know, it's a funny thing about that bird dying. I hid the key in Fredo's food dish. Whew! That's a weird coincidence.
JERRY Kramer!?
KRAMER What?
JERRY You killed Fredo!
KRAMER Fredo was weak and stupid. He shouldn't've eaten that key.
JERRY Kramer, I need those cufflinks, but now they're in the box, and the key is in the bird. What are we gonna do?
KRAMER You just answered your own question.
JERRY Oh, no.
KRAMER I'll get the shovel.
GEORGE The uh, actor thay played Jesus made some odd choices.
LORETTA What?
GEORGE I mean, uh... I had fun ice skating.
MAURA George?
GEORGE Maura. Oh, my God! What are you doing here?!
MAURA You told me to meet you here for lunch.
GEORGE Oh, I'm caught in my own web of lies!
MAURA I'm Maura.
LORETTA I'm Loretta. You want to join us?
GEORGE This is all blowing up in my face! My serious girlfriend, and my torrid love affair have accidentally crossed paths. I have ruined three lives. Well, I understand if you never want to see me again, so...
MAURA George, what we have is too important. We can work through this.
LORETTA So can we.
GEORGE What? So, this is still not over?
MAURA No.
GEORGE You?
LORETTA No.
GEORGE All right.
GLENN Elaine, wow, a TV stereo?
ELAINE Yeah, and I got you a cord of wood, so you won't have to burn 'em.
GLENN Oh my god Allison, you're home early.
ELAINE Who is this?
ALLISON His wife.
ELAINE You're poor and married?
GLENN Looks like it.
ALLISON Who the hell are you?
ELAINE I guess I'm Lois Loan.
JERRY Kramer, I can't believe we're grave robbers.
KRAMER Man's best friend. Jerry, I want somethinglike that on my tombstone.
JERRY Oh my God. Here he is. I don't want to dig him up.
KRAMER All right, then you're the one getting the key out of him.
JERRY I'll dig.
KRAMER Listen, I heard that Lassie 3 is buried around here. I'm gonna go check it out.
JERRY Well, that was easy.
PHIL All right,Honey, one last look, then you have to let Fredo rest in peace.
JERRY Hey, Kramer! I dug Fredo up, now let's cut him open!
PHIL Oh my god!
MRS._PHIL Oh!
JERRY Hey, neighbor.
GEORGE All right. I'mgonna try givin' them fifty-five dollars each. What do you think?
ELAINE Give me forty, you'll never see me again.
ELAINE So, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna live here, or are you gonna move out, or what?
JERRY Ah, I'll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building.
GEORGE So, what's in the cooler?
KRAMER Oh. Well, would you look at that. Guess I forgot to lock it.
JERRY You mean it was open? We desecrated a pet cemetery for something?
KRAMER Well, this is one for the books, huh, Jerry? Really one for the books.
GEORGE All right. So, what theatre you wanna go to tonight? We got 61st and 3rd or 84th and Broadway.
JERRY Which one you wanna go to shmoopy?
SHEILA You called me shmoppy. You're a shmoopy.
JERRY You're a shmoopy!
SHEILA You're a shmoopy!
JERRY You're a shmoopy!
GEORGE All right, shmoopies...what's it gonna be? Pick a theater.
JERRY Uh..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to the soup place?
SHEILA No. You have a good lunch. But I'll meet you back here for the movie.
GEORGE Hey.
ELAINE Hey.
SHEILA Hi Elaine.
ELAINE Hi Sheila.
JERRY All right, then. I'll see you later.
SHEILA Bye shmoopy.
JERRY Bye shmoopy.
ELAINE Okay. We ready to go?
GEORGE Yes. Please. Please, let's go.
ELAINE Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.
JERRY No. We gotta go to the soup place.
ELAINE What soup place?
GEORGE Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there.
JERRY He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned.
ELAINE Stunned by soup?
JERRY You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.
ELAINE Huh. All right. Come on.
JERRY There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi.
ELAINE Why? What happens if you don't order right?
JERRY He yells and you don't get your soup.
ELAINE What?
JERRY Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.
GEORGE All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again.
JERRY All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right.
ELAINE What?
JERRY The main thing is to keep the line moving.
GEORGE All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive.
JERRY Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.
ELAINE Oh, boy, I'm really scared!
JERRY Elaine.
ELAINE All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi. Whoa! Wow! Look at this. You know what this is? This is an antique armoire. Wow! It's French. Armoire.
JERRY Ar-moire.
ELAINE How much is this?
FURNITURE_GUY I was asking 250, but you got a nice face. 2 even.
ELAINE Huh? Ha. 200. You know, I've always wanted one of these things.
JERRY He gave you the nice face discount.
ELAINE Yeah. All right. You guys go ahead.
JERRY What about the soup?
ELAINE I'm getting an armoire, Jerry.
JERRY Pardon.
GEORGE This line is huge.
JERRY It's like this all the time.
GEORGE Isn't that that Bania guy?
JERRY Oh, no. It is. Just be still.
GEORGE Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent.
BANIA Hey, Jerry! I didn't know you liked soup.
JERRY Hard to believe.
BANIA This guy makes the best soup in the city, Jerry. The best. You know what they call him? Soup Nazi.
JERRY Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in line.
BANIA Why not?
JERRY Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again.
BANIA Okay. Okay.
GEORGE Medium turkey chili.
JERRY Medium crab bisque.
GEORGE I didn't get any bread.
JERRY Just forget it. Let it go.
GEORGE Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread.
SOUP_NAZI Bread -- $2 extra.
GEORGE $2? But everyone in front of me got free bread.
SOUP_NAZI You want bread?
GEORGE Yes, please.
SOUP_NAZI $3!
GEORGE What?
SOUP_NAZI No soup for you!
ELAINE What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here.
SUPER It's Sunday, Elaine. There's no moving on Sunday. That's the rule.
ELAINE But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception? Please. I've got a nice face.
SUPER Tomorrow, okay? You can move it in tommorrow. I'll even give you a hand, all right?
ELAINE Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me.
FURNITURE_GUY I'm a guy on the sidewalk. I don't have layaway.
ELAINE Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away.
JERRY Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?
GEORGE You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not even offer me any?
JERRY I gave you a taste. What do you want?
GEORGE Why can't we share?
JERRY I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!
GEORGE Do you hear yourself?
JERRY I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.
GEORGE Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila.
SHEILA Hi. Hi shmoopy.
JERRY Hi shmoopy.
SHEILA No, you're a shmoopy!
JERRY You're a shmoopy!
GEORGE I'm going.
JERRY Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?
GEORGE You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think so.
JERRY Why?
GEORGE I just don't feel like it anymore.
JERRY Just like that?
GEORGE Just like that.
SHEILA Boy, he's a weird guy, isn't he?
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER Yeah.
JERRY Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wha -- what are you doing?
KRAMER Yeah. Elaine, she has to leave her armoire on the street all night...I'm gonna guard it for her. I need something to sit on.
JERRY Well, sit on one of your couch cushions.
KRAMER Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there!
ELAINE Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this.
KRAMER Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it.
ELAINE Do you need anything?
KRAMER Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot.
ELAINE Mulligatawny?
KRAMER Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection by one of the great soup artisans in the modern era.
ELAINE Oh! Who? The Soup Nazi?
KRAMER He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. Most geniuses are.
ELAINE All right. I'll be back.
KRAMER Wait a second. You don't even know how to order.
ELAINE Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it.
KRAMER No. No, Elaine!
ELAINE Hey, I got it. Hey. Didn't you already get soup?
GEORGE No. I didn't get it.
ELAINE Why? What happened?
GEORGE I made a mistake.
ELAINE 
GEORGE All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you.
ELAINE Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of there with a bowl of soup.
GEORGE Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or do you find it unbearable to be around Jerry and that girl?
ELAINE Oh, I know! It is awful!
GEORGE Why do they have to do that in front of people?
ELAINE I don't know.
GEORGE What is that with the shmoopy?
ELAINE Ohh!
GEORGE The shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmmopy, shmoopy!
ELAINE Ohh! Stop it! I know.
GEORGE I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one is actually called shmoopy.
ELAINE Ugh!
GEORGE And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight.
ELAINE You know, we should say something.
GEORGE You know, we absolutely should.
ELAINE I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff that is?
GEORGE I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes.
ELAINE Yeah.
GEORGE I still haven't figured him out.
ELAINE No. Me neither.
GEORGE All right. Shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode.
ELAINE Oh, God!
GEORGE Good afternoon. One large crab bisque to go. Bread. Beautiful.
SOUP_NAZI You're pushing your luck little man.
GEORGE Sorry. Thank you.
ELAINE Hi there. Um, uh -- Oh! Oh! Oh! One mulligatawny and, um.... what is that right there? Is that lima bean?
SOUP_NAZI Yes.
ELAINE Never been a big fan. Um..you know what? Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Al Pacino? You know, " Scent Of A Woman." Who-ah! Who-ah!
SOUP_NAZI Very good. Very good.
ELAINE Well, I --
SOUP_NAZI You know something?
ELAINE Hmmm?
SOUP_NAZI No soup for you!
ELAINE What?
SOUP_NAZI Come back one year! Next!
RAY Look at this.
BOB It's an antique.
RAY It's all hand made and I love the in-lay.
BOB Yes. Yes. me, too. Ay, it's gorgeous. Completely. Pick it up. No. No. Pick it up from the bottom over there.
KRAMER Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing?
BOB What does it look like we're doing? We're taking this.
KRAMER You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine.
BOB Look, you wanna get hurt?
KRAMER Huh?
BOB I don't think you wanna get hurt. Because if you wanna get hurt I can hurt you. Now, just back off.
RAY Bob.
BOB Just pick it up.
KRAMER What is this, huh?
BOB You have some kind of problem here? What is it you not understanding? We taking the armoire and that's all there is to it. Okay?
ELAINE I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! I'm gonna call the states' attorney office. I really am.
GEORGE Oh, this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste this.
ELAINE All right. All right. Give me a tsate. Mmm! Oh God, I gotta sit down. What happened? Where's my armoire?
KRAMER Well, b -- it was stolen.
ELAINE Wha--?
KRAMER These street toughs, they robbed me.
ELAINE Street toughs took my armoire?
KRAMER Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You should've seen the way they talked to me.
ELAINE I can't believe this!
KRAMER Well, where's the soup?
ELAINE Wha -- the Soup Nazi threw me out.
KRAMER Oh...yeah!
JERRY What are you gonna get?
SHEILA I'll decide at the last minute.
JERRY You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!
JERRY Uh-oh.
SOUP_NAZI Hey, what is this? You're kissing in my line? Nobody kisses in my line!
SHEILA I can kiss anywhere I want to.
SOUP_NAZI You just cost yourself a soup!
SHEILA How dare you? Come on, Jerry, we're leaving. Jerry?
JERRY Do I know you?
ELAINE So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?
JERRY It was a bisque.
ELAINE Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become much more normal than you.
JERRY Really?
ELAINE Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to be married. Your top priority is soup.
JERRY Have you tastes the soup?
ELAINE Yeah. All right. You made the right decision.
JERRY See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the Soup Nazi.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER Yeah.
ELAINE Hey.
KRAMER Yeah.
JERRY Oh, thanks.
ELAINE There he is.
KRAMER Elaine, I'm really sorry about the armoire.
ELAINE Yeah. I know. Me, too.
JERRY So, did these thieves want any money?
KRAMER No.
JERRY They just wanted the armoire?
KRAMER Yeah. They were..quite taken with it.
JERRY Yeah?
GEORGE Hup! Hup!
JERRY Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately?
ELAINE No. In what way?
JERRY I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, or something.
ELAINE I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody.
GEORGE Hello.
JERRY Hello.
KRAMER Hey.
GEORGE Hello.
ELAINE Hello.
GEORGE Were you just talking about me? What's going on?
JERRY Absolutely not.
GEORGE Something's going on here.
KRAMER All right, I'm gonna go get some soup.
ELAINE One of these days that guy is gonna get his.
GEORGE So, how was the movie?
JERRY Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.
GEORGE Oh, yeah?
JERRY Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?
GEORGE Happy? Why should I be happy?
JERRY I don't know, but you look like you're happy.
GEORGE Why should I care?
JERRY You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know when you're happy.
GEORGE All right. I am happy, and I'll tell ya why -- because the two of you were making me and every one of your friends sick! Right, Elaine?
JERRY Is that so?
GEORGE Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy out in public like that. It's disgusting!
JERRY Disgusting?
GEORGE People who do that should be arrested.
JERRY Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her.
GEORGE Ye - yeah. And we had a pact, you know.
JERRY What?
GEORGE You shook my hand in that coffee shop.
JERRY You're still with the pact?
GEORGE Mmm-hmm. You reneged.
JERRY All I did was shake your hand.
GEORGE Ah-ha!
KRAMER And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that.
SOUP_NAZI Ohh! This city.
NEWMAN One large jambalaya, please.
SOUP_NAZI So, continue.
KRAMER Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, she's very emotional.
NEWMAN Thank you. Jambalaya!
SOUP_NAZI All right, now listen to me. You have been a good friend. I have an armoire in my basement. If you want to pick it up, you're welcome to it. So, take it, it's yours.
KRAMER How can I possibly thank you?
SOUP_NAZI You are the only one who understands me.
KRAMER You suffer for your soup.
SOUP_NAZI Yes. That is right.
KRAMER You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup.
SOUP_NAZI How can I tolerate any less from my customer?
CUSTOMER Uh, gazpacho, por favor.
SOUP_NAZI Por favor?
CUSTOMER Um, I'm part Spanish.
SOUP_NAZI Adios muchacho!
KRAMER Git.
JERRY It was stupid of me.
SHEILA Well, it was very insulting.
JERRY No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.
SHEILA Well, behind every joke there's some truth.
JERRY What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth to that. Nobody with a terminal illness goes from the United States to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they get there and they don't have it he says " Aw, I'll just have some coffee." There's no truth to that.
SHEILA Well, I guess you're right.
JERRY So, am I forgiven, shmoopy?
SHEILA Yes, shmoopy.
JERRY Aw!
SUSAN Hey, Jerry!
JERRY Oh, hi Susan, George. You remember Sheila.
GEORGE Oh, yes. Hello.
SHEILA Hello. Won't you join us?
GEORGE No, thanks.
SUSAN Of course.
GEORGE Yes. Well -- So, uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh?
JERRY Yeah. That's right. You got a problem?
GEORGE I, uh, just think it's a little unusual. Two people to sit on one side...and leave the other side empty.
JERRY Well, we're changing the rules.
GEORGE Ahh. Good for you.
SUSAN Aw, what are you getting George?
GEORGE I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? I want you to get anything you want...'cause I love you so much. I want you to be happy. Okay, sweetie?
SUSAN Oh, George, you're so sweet.
GEORGE Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie.
SUSAN Aww!
JERRY What about you, shmoopy? How 'bout a little tuna? You want a little tuna fishy?
SHEILA Yeah.
JERRY Yum yum little tuna fishy?
GEORGE Come here.
KRAMER And..voila!
ELAINE 
KRAMER Yeah.
ELAINE Oh! Oh, I love it! I absolutely love it!
KRAMER Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it?
ELAINE The K Man did it!
KRAMER Yeah!
ELAINE How much did you pay for this thing?
KRAMER How 'bout zero?
ELAINE What?
KRAMER Yeah.
ELAINE What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it?
KRAMER I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously refer to as the Soup Nazi.
ELAINE Get out!
ELAINE The Soup Nazi gave it to you?
KRAMER Yeah.
ELAINE Why?
KRAMER Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have it. Wha -- Yeah. He's a wonderful man.
ELAINE 
KRAMER Yeah. Well, a little bit misunderstood but, uh....
ELAINE Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I mean, I had this guy all wrong. This is wonderful!
KRAMER Yeah. Well, he's a dear.
GEORGE How much tip do you leave on $8.15?
SUSAN You know sweetie, I just want you to know that I was so proud of you today expressing your feelings so freely in front of Jerry and all. Just knowing that you're not afraid of those things is such a great step forward in our relationship.
GEORGE Huh?
SUSAN Because you love your little kiki don't you?
CUSTOMER How is he today?
BANIA I think he's in a good mood.
ELAINE Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful. I'm mean, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it.
SOUP_NAZI You? If I knew it was for you, I never would have given it to him in the first place! I would have taken a hatchet and smashed it to pieces! Now, who wants soup? Next! Speak up!
JERRY I'm heading over to Elaine's.
KRAMER Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire.
JERRY Those two?
KRAMER Yeah.
JERRY Are you sure?
KRAMER Yeah. That's them.
JERRY Well, let's confront 'em.
KRAMER No. No. No. No. Let's get a cop.
JERRY There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on.
KRAMER No!
JERRY Let's go.
BOB Oh, wow look, that one is gorgeous. I would just kill for that one.
RAY Oh, not in blue. Blue does not go with all.
BOB Oh, please. Do you know what you're talking about? Because I don't think you know what you're talking about. Take a look at that.
KRAMER Excuse me.
RAY Are you talking to me?
KRAMER Uh, well, uh, we --
RAY I said, are you talking to me?
BOB Well, maybe, he was talking to me. Was you talking to him? Because you was obviously talking to one of us. So what is it? Who?! Who was you talking to?!
KRAMER Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking to each other, weren't we?
ELAINE I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life. There's something really wrong with this man. He is a Soup Nazi. What? What is that?
JERRY I don't know. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds of celery, chopped parsley..."
ELAINE Let me see this. You know what this is? This is a recipe for soup, and look at this. There are like thirty different recipes. These are his recipes!
JERRY So?
ELAINE So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these to every restaurant in town. I could have 'em published! I could - I could drop fliers from a plane above the city.
JERRY Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going?
ELAINE What do you care?
JERRY Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand. I happen to love that soup.
ELAINE Get out of my way, Jerry.
JERRY Elaine, let the man make his soup!
ELAINE Don't make me hurt you, Jerry.
SUSAN Look, they have it in blue...for my baby bluey. Are you my baby bluey?
GEORGE Oh, yes. I - I'm your baby bluey.
JERRY Well. Well.
SUSAN Hi, Jerry.
JERRY Hey, Susan, George.
SUSAN You know, I really like Sheila a lot.
JERRY Oh, really?
SUSAN Mmm-hmm.
JERRY Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.
SUSAN Oh, no! That's too bad.
JERRY Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I love that - but mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection.
GEORGE Really?
JERRY Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that.
SUSAN Mmm-hmm.
GEORGE You did?
JERRY Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya.
GEORGE Yeah. See ya.
SOUP_NAZI Go on! Leave! Get out!
WOMAN But I didn't do anything.
SOUP_NAZI Next!
ELAINE Hello.
SOUP_NAZI You. You think you can get soup? Please. You're wasting everyone's time.
ELAINE I don't want soup. I can make my own soup. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds celery."
SOUP_NAZI That is my recipe for wild mushroom.
ELAINE Yeah, that's right. I got 'em all. Cold cucumber, corn and crab chowder, mulligatawny.
SOUP_NAZI Mulliga...tawny?
ELAINE You're through Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
NEWMAN Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!
JERRY What is it?
NEWMAN Something's happened with the Soup Nazi!
JERRY Wha - wha - what's the matter?
NEWMAN Elaine's down there causing all kinds of commotion. Somehow she got a hold of his recipes and she says she's gonna drive him out of business! The Soup Nazi said that now that his recipes are out, he's not gonna make anymore soup! He's moving out of the country, moving to Argentina! No more soup, Jerry! No more soup for any of us!
JERRY Well, where are you going?
NEWMAN He's giving away what's left! I gotta go home and get a big pot!
JERRY I tell ya, I never really understood the importance of the conductor. I mean between you and me, what the hell is this guy doing? Do you really need somebody waving a stick in your face to play the violin? Does that really help you out? I could see how we need him at the beginning. Okay, tap-tap-tap, start. Okay, I can see how you need that. But once we're going, okay, once it's all happening, what do we need him for then? I don't see the cellist looking up, go, "I'm confused. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do." And the conductor goes, "Do this. Like this" "Oh, okay, thank you very much."
GEORGE Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet anybody, I should just accept it.
JERRY Oh, yes you will.
GEORGE No, I won't.
JERRY Yeah, maybe you won't.
GEORGE I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.
JERRY Are my nostrils getting bigger?
GEORGE No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, "Hi. I'm George. How are you?" Is that so terrible?
CYNTHIA There's just no men out there, you know?
ELAINE I know.
CYNTHIA I mean the problem is that the good ones know they're good. And they know they're in such demand they're just not interested in confining themselves to one person.
ELAINE I hate the good ones.
CYNTHIA Is Jerry one of the good ones?
ELAINE That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.
CYNTHIA Well, the mediocre ones are available, but they're so insecure about not being one of the good ones that they're always going, "Well I'm not good enough for you, what are you doing with me?" and eventually I just go, "You're right."
ELAINE You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.
CYNTHIA No, maybe I need somebody who has nothing, somebody who just has to appreciate being with me because he's so desperate.
GEORGE I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone. I almost made a date with one.
JERRY Oh, so there's still hope.
GEORGE I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive.
JERRY Oh, so hopelessness is the key.
GEORGE It's my only hope.
CYNTHIA See, I wouldn't really mind so much, but I feel badly for my mother. I mean, if my mother weren't around, it wouldn't be so bad. But, I'm telling you, if I'm not married by the time I'm forty, I'm gonna have to kill her because it's the only fair thing to do. I just couldn't put her through that.
ELAINE Well, at least you're not bitter.
CYNTHIA Who says I'm not bitter?
ELAINE Aren't you too young to be bitter?
CYNTHIA No, you can be young and bitter, just maybe not as bitter as I'm gonna be ten years from now, but I'm bitter. Anyway, don't tell anyone.
ELAINE Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me.
CYNTHIA Um, order me a piece of cake. I'm gonna go throw up.
JERRY Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.
ELAINE So what'd you do last night?
JERRY Went out with George, you?
ELAINE Went out with Cynthia.
JERRY How was it? What'd you talk about?
ELAINE Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest. Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get rid of it in one fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. What about you?
JERRY We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't find anybody.
ELAINE I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.
JERRY George too.
JERRY_AND_ELAINE Yeah, right.
JERRY I've never fixed anybody up.
ELAINE Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.
JERRY Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for George?
ELAINE I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?
JERRY Well you implied it.
ELAINE I didn't say it.
JERRY Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong. Dead wrong. Who is she?
ELAINE Who is he?
JERRY He's George!
ELAINE She's Cynthia!
JERRY So what?
ELAINE What, you don't think she's beautiful?
JERRY I don't know, what's with the eyebrows?
ELAINE You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.
JERRY I went out with you.
ELAINE That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know, women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. Bald above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.
JERRY Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook.
ELAINE He can really do that?
JERRY Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along.
ELAINE What, are you into this?
JERRY Yeah, come on, it's a good match.
ELAINE No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how their dates went. Are we gonna share that information?
JERRY Naturally.
ELAINE Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean every secret?
JERRY Everything.
ELAINE What if it worked out?
JERRY Yeah right.
GEORGE Out of the question. Out of the question!
JERRY Why?
GEORGE No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads! And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she look like?
JERRY She's good looking.
GEORGE How good looking?
JERRY Very good looking.
GEORGE Really good looking?
JERRY Really very good looking.
GEORGE Would you take her out?
JERRY Yes, I would take her out.
GEORGE Oh, you hesitated.
JERRY What hesitate? I didn't hesitate!
GEORGE No, something's off here, you hesitated.
JERRY I'm telling you, she's good looking.
GEORGE What about the body, what kind of body?
JERRY Good body, nice body.
GEORGE How nice?
JERRY Nice.
GEORGE Just nice?
JERRY Pretty nice.
GEORGE Really good?
JERRY Really very nice and good.
GEORGE What about personality?
JERRY Good personality. Funny. Bright.
GEORGE Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me.
JERRY How could she be smarter than you?
GEORGE Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, what does she do?
CYNTHIA First of all, what does he do?
ELAINE He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now-
CYNTHIA He's not working?! How come he's not working?
ELAINE Well, um, he, he got fired.
CYNTHIA Why did he get fired?
ELAINE Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss.
CYNTHIA Excuse me?
ELAINE Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems at work.
CYNTHIA Is he nuts?
ELAINE No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy.
CYNTHIA What does he look like?
ELAINE Pardon?
CYNTHIA What does he look like?
ELAINE Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short. Um, he's stocky.
CYNTHIA Fat. Is that what you're saying, that he's fat?
ELAINE Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's kind of, just kind of losing his hair.
CYNTHIA He's bald?
ELAINE No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding.
CYNTHIA So he will be bald.
ELAINE Yup.
GEORGE What kind of hair?
JERRY You know, long dark hair.
GEORGE Flowing?
JERRY Flowing?
GEORGE Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is very important to me.
JERRY 'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?
GEORGE Yeah, that's right.
JERRY Just clarifying.
GEORGE Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to get it out?
JERRY Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to get it out?
GEORGE I'd like to be able to get it out.
JERRY I think you'll get it out.
GEORGE What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek.
JERRY She's got a fine cheek.
GEORGE Is there a pinkish hue?
JERRY A pinkish hue?
GEORGE Yes, a rosy glow.
JERRY There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her eyebrows.
GEORGE Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? I like sweet. But not too sweet, you could throw up from that.
JERRY I don't think you'll throw up. She likes to throw up.
CYNTHIA Has he ever been married?
ELAINE No.
CYNTHIA Has he been close?
ELAINE He once spent a weekend with a woman.
CYNTHIA He didn't really try to poison his boss?
ELAINE Yeah, he did.
GEORGE We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You know, I thought she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber?
JERRY I think it's tamber.
GEORGE Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials, why didn't you tell me about her voice?
JERRY I didn't notice the voice.
GEORGE It's mellifluous!
JERRY So, Saturday night.
GEORGE She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a great performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they should just have two phones on the table at the restaurant, done.
ELAINE Hi.
GEORGE Hey! Saturday night!
ELAINE I know!
GEORGE So, what did she say?
ELAINE She said you're getting together Saturday night!
GEORGE That's it?
ELAINE Yeah!
GEORGE She didn't mention anything about the conversation?
ELAINE No.
GEORGE Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention it?
ELAINE What?
JERRY She could have mentioned the conversation.
GEORGE Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER You know my friend, Bob Sacamano?
JERRY Oh, the guy from Jersey?
KRAMER Yeah. He just got a job at a condom factory in Edison. Look at this, he gave me a gross.
GEORGE What are you gonna do with all of them?
KRAMER Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. Grab 'em.
JERRY No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box.
KRAMER Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag.
ELAINE Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap.
GEORGE I'll take one. It's possible.
JERRY The problem with the condom is still buying them. I think we should have like a secret signal with the druggist that you just walk into the drugstore, you go up to the counter, he looks at you and if you go like this he puts them in the bag for you, that's it. You show up there, you put your little shaving cream, your little toothpaste, you know, "How are you today?" "Have a nice day." "You too."
JERRY So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back by now, what did they do?
ELAINE I think they went out to dinner.
JERRY Wait, I got another call. That must be him. Hello?
GEORGE Yeah, it's me, I just got home.
JERRY Oh, hold on. It's George, he just got home.
ELAINE Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line.
JERRY Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.
ELAINE Remember our pact. Full disclosure.
JERRY Of course. Yeah, go ahead.
GEORGE Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, we swore we were not going to tell you and Elaine.
JERRY You can tell me, I'll vault it.
GEORGE It's in the vault?
JERRY I'm locking the vault. What?
GEORGE We had sex.
JERRY Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?
GEORGE I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.
JERRY At your apartment?
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY She didn't stay over?
GEORGE No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine. Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal.
ELAINE Oh my god.
CYNTHIA He was uncomfortable because it was our first time so he felt he would perform better if we did it in the kitchen. He said the kitchen is always the most sociable room in the house. And he was serious.
ELAINE So? How was it?
CYNTHIA How good could it be? My head was on a hot plate.
ELAINE Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry.
CYNTHIA Oh wait, don't you tell him any of this.
ELAINE Yeah, ok. Hello?
JERRY So, what did she have to say?
ELAINE What did he have to say?
JERRY He said they had a good time.
ELAINE Her too.
JERRY Oh, good.
ELAINE Anything else?
JERRY Nope. You?
ELAINE Nope.
JERRY You sure?
ELAINE Yup. You?
JERRY Yeah.
ELAINE Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control.
JERRY Yeah. Okay then.
ELAINE Alright. Goodnight.
JERRY Goodnight.
GEORGE I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. What kind of a person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated.
JERRY Well, I'm gonna do something about this.
GEORGE What are you gonna do?
JERRY Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever. She's not going to get away with this.
GEORGE I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people.
JERRY I'm gonna call her.
GEORGE No, don't call her.
JERRY No, I'm calling her.
GEORGE No, Jerry, don't call.
JERRY No, forget it, I'm gonna call.
GEORGE I don't want you to call.
JERRY Get away from me, I'm gonna call her.
GEORGE Give me the phone!
JERRY George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?
GEORGE Jerry, I'm gonna kill you!
KRAMER Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!
JERRY I'll just call her when you leave!
GEORGE You can't do that, it's none of your business!
JERRY It is so my business!
KRAMER Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one of you!
GEORGE But tell him to give me the--
KRAMER Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet I know what this is about. It's about a woman, isn't it?
GEORGE No.
JERRY Yeah, but--
KRAMER Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you like that.
JERRY But Kramer--
KRAMER Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are plenty of women out there for all of us, let's go. Jerry and George shake hands.
KRAMER Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean, you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the way George, you know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them.
GEORGE What?
KRAMER Right.
GEORGE Defective?!
KRAMER Defective.
GEORGE How could you give me a defective condom?!
KRAMER I didn't even know they were defective.
KRAMER Didn't even think you were gonna use them.
GEORGE What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!
JERRY Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if anything was wrong she would have called you already!
CYNTHIA I missed my period.
ELAINE Oh my god.
CYNTHIA I am very worried, I am never late.
ELAINE But he used a condom, right?
CYNTHIA I know, but these things aren't always foolproof.
ELAINE Oh no.
CYNTHIA What?
ELAINE Was it blue?
CYNTHIA Yeah. How'd you know?
ELAINE Just a hunch.
JERRY Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off!
JERRY Oh, hi. Soda?
ELAINE No thanks.
JERRY So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She doesn't return calls?
ELAINE Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's good and ready. You don't even know her.
JERRY Oh, I know her. I know her type.
ELAINE Her type? What type?
JERRY The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!
ELAINE You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!
JERRY I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend.
ELAINE She's not bitter!
JERRY Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!
ELAINE Twisted? God, I did you a favor.
JERRY I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're keeping from me?
ELAINE Are you calling me a liar?
JERRY I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?
ELAINE Are you?
JERRY Get your finger out of my face.
ELAINE You get yours out, I was here first!
JERRY I don't care.
ELAINE Get it out!
KRAMER Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with each other? I mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around out there looking for something that's not even there, when everything that you dream of is right here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? By the way, when you see George give him these, these'll work.
ELAINE I knew those condoms were defective!
JERRY How did you know they were defective?!
ELAINE Because! Because she missed her period!
GEORGE She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father! I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!
CYNTHIA So he shows up. He's all out of breath. He's disheveled. And he tells me that no matter what happens, whatever I decide is fine with him and that I could depend on him, and that he would be there to support me in whatever way I need. Elaine, I was speechless.
ELAINE Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody.
CYNTHIA I said to him, "I really appreciate this, but I just got my period."
ELAINE Hi!
GEORGE Sorry, we're a little late. We got so hung up in traffic.
ELAINE What happened?
JERRY Acting.
ELAINE Very mature.
JERRY Thank you. Hi Cynthia.
CYNTHIA Hi.
JERRY Well this is a great place to sit you got here.
CYNTHIA Best seat in the house. right next to the kitchen.
GEORGE Stop it, stop it.
JERRY So what are these?
ELAINE Oh, we ordered some appetizers. Start eating.
GEORGE This is good. Oh, this is good.
JERRY Have you ever fixed anybody up? Why do we do it? Why? You thought they would have a good time. And a little power trip for you, isn't it? Now, you're playing god. Of course god was the first person to fix people up. He fixed up Adam and Eve. You know, I'm sure he said to Adam, "She's nice. She's very free about her body, doesn't really wear that much. She was going out with a snake, I think that's over though."
JERRY At parking lots now they have these 'compact car only' spots, isn't that discrimination against the size of your car? If I want my ass hanging out of the back of my parking spot, that's my business. There are people out there with real asses hanging out of their pants, nobody's stopping them. Nobody goes, "Hey, hold it, sir. Those are compact jeans, you can't pull that in there."
KRAMER Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. I think your car got stolen again.
JERRY What are you talking about?
KRAMER Well you parked it on eighty-fourth and Columbus, right?
JERRY Yeah.
KRAMER Yep, well I just walked by there and that car is gone.
JERRY Oh yeah, I know.
KRAMER Well, where is it?
JERRY What's the difference?
KRAMER Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious.
JERRY You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?
KRAMER What happened to the car?
JERRY If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?
KRAMER Yeah, yeah, it'll kill me.
JERRY You have to know, you must know.
KRAMER I must know.
JERRY Well, I'm not telling you.
KRAMER Oh, come on.
JERRY Nope. I don't think so.
KRAMER Well, please?
JERRY Not today, pal.
KRAMER Okay, I beg you.
JERRY Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put some beg into it.
KRAMER Okay, please! Please tell me!
JERRY Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work.
KRAMER Okay, okay, what is it? Come on.
JERRY I loaned the car to George.
KRAMER Ah, George, alright. Well, what for?
JERRY George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!
KRAMER Alright.
JERRY Huh?
KRAMER Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for?
JERRY Will you stop it already?!
KRAMER You know, why didn't they ask me to go?
JERRY I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!
KRAMER What, they don't like me?
JERRY I don't like you!
KRAMER If they like me, why don't they ask me to go? Oh yeah.
GEORGE I really think it looks good.
ELAINE Ten bucks, how can you go wrong?
GEORGE All bald people look good in hats.
ELAINE You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore hats all the time then.
GEORGE What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew.
ELAINE Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?
GEORGE No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her face.
ELAINE Are you sure you like these sunglasses?
KRAMER Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know I'm somebody you don't want to have on your bad side.
JERRY Why not?
KRAMER Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got problems. Oh, is this for the fight?
JERRY Yep. Starts in thirty-five minutes.
KRAMER Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. You don't mind, do you?
JERRY No, I like Mike.
KRAMER Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great conversation.
JERRY Oh yeah? What did you talk about?
KRAMER Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. He had some pretty interesting things to say.
JERRY Oh yeah? What did he say?
KRAMER You have to know everything, don't you?
JERRY No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?
KRAMER Why is that? Why do you have to know everything?
JERRY Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.
KRAMER Beg me.
JERRY Please, don't make me beg.
KRAMER No no no, I want you to beg me. And I don't want you to say it, I just want you to put some beg into it. Go on.
JERRY Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.
KRAMER No no no, that's no good. No, I really don't think that's a beg. No, it's close, but uh...
JERRY Kramer!
KRAMER Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff in confidence, I'd be betraying a friend.
JERRY Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.
KRAMER Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him.
JERRY I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault, it's a vault!
KRAMER He thinks you're a phony.
JERRY He what?
KRAMER I told you, he thinks you're a phony.
JERRY A phony? He called me a phony?
KRAMER A big phone. A big one.
JERRY Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!
KRAMER You begged me.
GEORGE Do you hear that?
ELAINE Of course I hear that.
GEORGE You had to move the mirror?
ELAINE I wanted to check out my sunglasses.
GEORGE I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my equilibrium.
ELAINE Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George.
GEORGE I can't drive?
ELAINE Yeah.
GEORGE Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane? Watch this.
ELAINE No, I really don't.
GEORGE And I can make a left turn from the right lane too.
ELAINE I'm sure you could.
GEORGE What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?
ELAINE I don't know.
GEORGE Alright, start looking for spaces.
ELAINE Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a garage.
GEORGE Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.
ELAINE Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend an hour looking for a space.
GEORGE I can't park in a garage.
ELAINE Why?
GEORGE I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking, it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother, nobody. We can't do it.
ELAINE I'll pay for it.
GEORGE You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I could get it for free? What? What do you want? Go around me, I'm looking for spaces.
ELAINE Oh George, there's a space right there!
GEORGE Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come true, what did I tell you?
ELAINE You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.
GEORGE Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. How I wish you could make a living parallel parking. It's all geometry, knowing all the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in, that's the key.
ELAINE Will you just park it already?
GEORGE There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's so inborn, I can't pass it on. Look at this guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my space!
ELAINE George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking space in this city.
GEORGE No no no, he's not getting away with this.
ELAINE George?
GEORGE Hey, what are you doing?
MIKE I think I'm parking my car.
GEORGE You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that.
MIKE I'm not sneaking. I didn't even know you were parking, you were just sitting there three spaces up.
GEORGE Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head first?
MIKE Well that's the way I park. Anyway, you didn't start backing in until I pulled in.
GEORGE I was in the middle of a conversation.
MIKE Hey, buddy, what can I tell you?
GEORGE The point is I was here first.
MIKE I was closer to this space than you were.
GEORGE But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!
MIKE I can if I have room!
GEORGE Are you gonna move the car?
MIKE No, I'm not gonna move the car.
GEORGE Jerk!
MIKE Oh, you're not?
GEORGE Do you believe this guy?
ELAINE Come on, we'll put it in a garage.
GEORGE I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space.
ELAINE What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh. I'm going upstairs.
GEORGE Are you coming back down?
ELAINE Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom.
GEORGE Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car?
ELAINE Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo.
GEORGE Oh, come on, you're good at this.
ELAINE What am I gonna say?
GEORGE I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something.
ELAINE Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?
JERRY Yeah, under the counter. What happened?
ELAINE Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home. You wouldn't believe it.
JERRY Tell me what happened.
ELAINE the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?! So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a great driver.
JERRY He is?
ELAINE Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air.
JERRY A gun?!
ELAINE I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home.
JERRY My god, are you okay?
ELAINE Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now it's making a clanking noise.
JERRY Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.
ELAINE Exactly.
JERRY Where's George now?
ELAINE Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy about a parking space.
JERRY What are you talking about?
ELAINE Look out the window, you'll see.
JERRY Hey Georgie!
GEORGE Hey!
JERRY Are you okay?
GEORGE Yeah, I'm fine.
JERRY Crazy kids, huh?
GEORGE What?
ELAINE Ow!! It's my cuticle.
MIKE Is that Jerry? Jerry?!
JERRY Oh, hey Mike.
GEORGE What, you know Jerry?
MIKE Yeah, I know Jerry.
GEORGE How do you know him?
MIKE What's the difference?
GEORGE Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you.
MIKE Well, bully for you. Hey, Jerry! You know your friend here's a real piece of work!
JERRY I'm coming down.
MIKE Hey, will you tell Kramer I'm outside?
GEORGE What, you know Kramer?!
ELAINE Hi.
KRAMER Hello.
JERRY Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you.
KRAMER Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting!
GEORGE And you're watching the fight at Jerry's?
MIKE Yeah.
GEORGE Oh great.
ELAINE You know that guy downstairs?
JERRY Yeah, he's a real phony.
KRAMER What's going on?!
MIKE Hey, will you come on down? This guy's in my space!
GEORGE It's my space!
KRAMER I'll be down in a minute.
ELAINE Are you going down?
KRAMER Yeah.
ELAINE Is anything wrong?
KRAMER Why should anything be wrong?
ELAINE Be down in a minute.
MIKE Hey pal, you're not getting that space. I mean, I'll sleep in my car if I have to.
GEORGE I'll die out here.
BYSTANDER_1 He was down there. Once he passed his front bumper, it's no longer his space.
BYSTANDER_2 No, it doesn't matter. He was-
MIKE Hey! Jerry! Long time no see!
JERRY Hi Mike. Indiana.
MIKE Hey Krame! You know this guy?
KRAMER Yeah, yeah, I know him.
MIKE You're looking tremendous. What are you on some kind of regimen?
JERRY Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent.
MIKE Ha ha ha ha!!! That's killer! Killer! I love that! Ha ha ha!!! You gotta use that, that's a definite!! Ha ha ha!!!
GEORGE Oh, come on.
MIKE Hey! Your friend here has some real problems.
GEORGE Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my space?
MIKE Hey, just 'cause I went in front first doesn't mean I'm sneaking in.
GEORGE You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you didn't have room to parallel park!
MIKE I only went in front first 'cause I could make it in front first and if you pull out I'll show you!
GEORGE You've got a prayer.
KRAMER I go in front first all the time.
JERRY Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.
GEORGE Did you talk to him?
ELAINE Yeah, it's all taken care of.
GEORGE You told him? What did you tell him?
ELAINE I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have been there to appreciate it.
GEORGE I don't believe it, what did you say?
ELAINE I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city.
GEORGE A pack of teenagers?
ELAINE Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car.
GEORGE You are a genius, it's as simple as that.
ELAINE What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it but, you know it's inborn.
KRAMER By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market.
ELAINE What?
KRAMER Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it.
GEORGE Oh great.
JERRY I didn't know.
ELAINE Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny.
GEORGE Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.
MIKE A flea market? You went to a flea market??
GEORGE Hey, who's talking to you?
ELAINE We just didn't think of you.
KRAMER You said it, sister.
GEORGE What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing? People forget. Look at "Home Alone". They forgot.
GEORGE Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move.
JERRY I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!
GEORGE Judgement, Jerry, judgement! You exercised no judgement.
JERRY You're right. My fault.
ELAINE Kramer? I'm so sorry, really.
GEORGE Yeah, I'm sorry.
KRAMER I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry.
GEORGE What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that a good sorry?
JERRY It was a so-so sorry.
TRUCK_DRIVER Hey! Move this car, I gotta get through!
GEORGE You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.
MIKE And like you're not gonna just back it in if I do that?
TRUCK_DRIVER Well somebody better move something soon! I got a truck full of ice cream here!
ELAINE You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them.
JERRY Wild pack of teenagers, huh?
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.
ELAINE Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?
GEORGE Uh huh.
JERRY Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,
GEORGE Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what you're capable of.
ELAINE Right.
GEORGE I learned a lot about myself.
JERRY What did you do to my car?!
GEORGE I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated.
ELAINE Oh, like you've ever been bobulated.
JERRY I thought you said you were a good driver!
GEORGE No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker.
JERRY I think you said driver.
GEORGE Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker.
MIKE Will you move it up a little bit?
GEORGE No no no, that's in the right position.
MIKE No no, I was further in.
GEORGE No you weren't. Stop there, that's fine.
MIKE Do you mind?
GEORGE Do you?
SID Hey, somebody better move these cars, you're making a commotion.
JERRY Hey Sid.
MIKE Who are you?
SID Never mind who I am. I know who I am. Do you know who you are? Why is it every time you park a car in this block, everything gets disrupted and disjointed?
GEORGE Sid, it's completely his fault.
MIKE Oh, right.
SID Why don't you start taking the bus?
JERRY Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The fight's starting in two minutes.
GEORGE Don't do it!
JERRY What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?
GEORGE Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space.
ELAINE Why don't you just flip a coin already?
GEORGE No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well I'm making a stand here. I'm saying no to head first parking. I'm not putting up with that. We put up with too much crap in this city, we're not putting up with head first parking.
ELAINE You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about what a great parker you were, you might have got the space.
GEORGE So you're against me now? An old man and Matthew, the boy who's father owns the 'fat free' frozen yogurt store, are discussing the incident.
ANGRY_MAN He could have pulled up to the car and backed in, but he chose to go in head first.
MATTHEW No he couldn't, because the other car was already backing in.
ANGRY_MAN No he wasn't.
MATTHEW All that matters is who was there first.
ANGRY_MAN Ahh, you're not even old enough to drive, you little puke.
MATTHEW You just spit on me!
ANGRY_MAN Don't you raise your voice to me!
MATTHEW You're not my father.
JERRY Hey Matthew.
MATTHEW Hi Jerry. This guy's really a jerk.
JERRY How ya doing?
MATTHEW Okay.
JERRY Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store.
MATTHEW What?!
JERRY Oh no, nothing.
MATTHEW What's happened to daddy? He's going out of business?
JERRY No, no, no, no.
MATTHEW We're not going to have any money? We're out of money?
JERRY No, of course not, of course not!
MATTHEW Mommy!? Jerry says daddy's closing the store. He's going out of business. We don't have any money?
MARYEDITH Jerry?! What's the matter with you?
JERRY I didn't--
MARYEDITH Boy, I don't know about your friend, Jerry. He says some pretty stupid things sometimes.
KRAMER Oh, congratulations.
MARYEDITH What for?
KRAMER Well, you're pregnant.
MARYEDITH What?
KRAMER You're not pregnant?
MARYEDITH No, I'm not pregnant.
KRAMER Are you sure you're not pregnant?
MARYEDITH Yes, I'm sure!
KRAMER That's weird.
MARYEDITH Come on, Matthew.
MATTHEW No.
MARYEDITH Come on, Matthew!
KRAMER I thought she was pregnant.
JERRY Hey, do you think I'm phony?
ELAINE What?
JERRY Mike thinks I'm a phony.
ELAINE He thinks you're a phony?
JERRY Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell me.
ELAINE Oh, you have to say something.
JERRY I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.
ELAINE You gotta open the vault.
JERRY Open my vault?
ELAINE Open your vault.
JERRY Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.
ELAINE You have no choice.
JERRY Oy ga-vault.
NEWMAN You wanna know why you can't go in front first? I'll tell you why. because it signals a breakdown in the social order. Chaos. It reduces us to jungle law.
KRAMER When can you park head first?
NEWMAN Never.
MIKE What are you asking this guy for?
NEWMAN Who's talking to you?
GEORGE He's right. never.
MIKE Oh yeah? What if you got ten car lengths? You have to pull all the way up to the front car?
NEWMAN Well, I suppose if you got ten car lengths.
GEORGE When do you ever have ten car lengths?
KRAMER What about Sundays and holidays?
GEORGE Oh please.
SHEILA What's going on here?
GEORGE Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space.
SHEILA I really hate people who do that. I hope you don't let him get away with it.
GEORGE Well, thank you for your support.
SHEILA Hey, that's a great hat.
GEORGE Really? You like it? I got it at a flea market today.
NEWMAN Hey George, nice hat.
GEORGE Yeah, thanks.
NEWMAN Can I try it on?
GEORGE No! It, uh, it wouldn't fit you.
NEWMAN Well sure it would.
GEORGE No! Get out of here, Newman.
NEWMAN Come on, let me try it on.
GEORGE No, Newman, stop it.
SHEILA Let him try it on.
GEORGE I don't want him to!
SHEILA What is wrong with you?
GEORGE You wanna see?! There! There it is! Alright, here! You wanna try on the hat?! Here! Try on the hat!
NEWMAN Stop it, George, stop it. I was defending your parking.
GEORGE Alright, just keep the hat!
JERRY Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs, who's coming? Elaine?
ELAINE It depends on who's going. Are you going?
KRAMER I'm not going if he's going.
NEWMAN Me either.
GEORGE I'm not going if he's going.
MIKE Well I'm going.
JERRY Well if he's going then I'm not going.
NEWMAN But it's your house.
JERRY I still don't have to go.
ELAINE Well I don't want to go if Jerry's not going.
MIKE Why won't you go if I go?
JERRY Why? I'll tell you why.
KRAMER No. Don't, Jerry.
JERRY Like you didn't call me a phony?
MIKE What? Thanks! Real good! Jerry! First of all, I think you completely misunderstood what I said. I meant it in a complementary way. I mean, you know when people say, 'He's bad', it really means he's good, sort of thing? You know, slang.
JERRY Use it in a sentence.
MIKE Man, that Michael Jordan is so phony. Why'd you tell him?!?
KRAMER He begged me.
MIKE He begged you?!
JERRY Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight?
COP_1 Okay, who's cars are these? Let's move 'em. Let's go.
GEORGE Officer, could I just explain something to you?
COP_1 Hey. Let's go or I'm gonna write both of you a ticket in about two minutes.
GEORGE Officer, he can't pull in head first.
MIKE Officer, he backed up from down the street. He was double-parked, he was sitting there.
COP_1 Alright, you move your car. It's his space, you can't go in head first.
COP_2 Wait a second. Why can't he go in head first? He said the guy was just sitting over there.
COP_1 What are you talking about? This guy was here first.
COP_2 But he didn't take it.
COP_1 Hey, it's his space.
COP_2 No, it's his space.
GEORGE Well, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom!
MIKE Well, you're gonna have to go to work!
GEORGE I don't have a job!
MIKE Neither do I!
REFEREE Seven... Eight... Nine... Ten. ding
JERRY People will kill each other for a parking space in New York because they think, 'If I don't get this one, I may never get a space.' You know? 'I'll be circling for months until somebody goes out to the Hamptons.' I think because everyone in New York City knows there's gotta be way more cars than parking spaces. You see cars driving in New York all hours of the night. It's like Musical Chairs except everybody sat down around 1964. The problem is car manufacturers are building hundreds of thousands of new cars every year, they're not making any new spaces. That's what they should be working on. Wouldn't that be great? You go to the Auto Show, they got that big revolving turntable, and there's nothing on it. New from Chrysler, a space.
JERRY Do you believe this? The car was parked right out front.
GEORGE Was the alarm on?
JERRY I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; I'm not tuned in to it like it's my son.
GEORGE I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?
JERRY They cross the wires or something.
GEORGE Cross the wires? I can't even make a pot of spaghetti. Kramer enters.
JERRY They stole my car.
KRAMER Who did?
JERRY They did.
KRAMER Was it more than just one?
JERRY What should I do, should I call the police?
KRAMER What are they gonna do?
JERRY I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service.
GEORGE Maybe you should call your car phone.
JERRY Yeah, he's probably driving it right now.
GEORGE Wait a minute, call the car phone, see what happens.
JERRY Are you serious?
GEORGE Yeah, go ahead, call.
JERRY I don't even know if I remember the number. Jerry dials.
JERRY What do I say if he picks up?
CAR_THIEF Hello?
JERRY Hello? Is this 555-8383?
CAR_THIEF I have no idea.
JERRY Can I ask you a question?
CAR_THIEF Sure.
JERRY Did you steal my car?
CAR_THIEF Yes I did.
JERRY You did?!
CAR_THIEF I did.
JERRY That's my car!
CAR_THIEF I didn't know it was yours.
JERRY What are you gonna do with it?
CAR_THIEF I dunno, drive around.
JERRY Then can I have it back?
CAR_THIEF Mmmm, nah, I'm gonna keep it. Kramer gestures for Jerry to hand him the phone.
KRAMER Hello?
CAR_THIEF Yeah, who's this?
KRAMER Kramer.
CAR_THIEF Hello, Kramer.
KRAMER Listen, there's a pair of gloves in the glove compartment.
CAR_THIEF Wait, hold on... Brown ones?
KRAMER Yeah. Listen, could you mail those to me? Or bring them by my building, it's 129 West 81st St.
CAR_THIEF One-two-nine, okay.
KRAMER Thanks a lot, uh here's Jerry.
JERRY Gloves. Hello?
CAR_THIEF Jerry?
JERRY Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires?
CAR_THIEF I didn't cross any wires, the keys were in it.
JERRY Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive carefully.
CAR_THIEF Jerry, when's the last time you had a tune-up? Because I can't find the-- Jerry hangs up.
JERRY Sid left the keys in the car.
GEORGE Who's Sid?
JERRY He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block.
GEORGE What do you mean?
JERRY He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get a ticket.
GEORGE What, do you pay him for that?
JERRY Yeah, like fifty bucks a month.
GEORGE How many people does he do that for?
JERRY The whole block, forty, fifty cars.
KRAMER He only works three hours a day. He makes a fortune. Course he's been doing that for years, right Jerry?
GEORGE Could anybody do that? Sid enters.
JERRY Hey Sid, what happened?
SID I'm sorry, Jerry. Maybe I'm getting too old for this stuff.
JERRY You left the keys in the car?
SID Well, you know they're making that Woody Allen movie in the block, and all those people and trucks everywhere, when I saw him I must have got a little distracted.
KRAMER You know I'm in that movie?
GEORGE You are?
KRAMER Yeah, I'm an extra.
GEORGE How'd you get that?
KRAMER Well, I was just watching them film yesterday and some guy just asked me.
GEORGE Right out of the clear blue sky?
KRAMER Clear blue sky!
GEORGE Well, why didn't they ask me?
KRAMER I got a quality.
SID Jerry, you got insurance, right?
JERRY Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one.
SID Well I'm going down to visit my sister in Virginia next Wednesday, for a week, so I can't park it.
JERRY This Wednesday?
SID No, next Wednesday, week after this Wednesday.
JERRY But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.
SID If I meant this Wednesday, I would have said this Wednesday. It's the week after this Wednesday.
GEORGE Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away?
SID Whoever wants to move them, why do I care who moves them? They can move themselves if they want.
GEORGE Maybe I could move them until you get back.
SID What's a young man like you want to move cars for? You don't work?
GEORGE I'm in a transition phase right now.
SID Well if you want to move the cars, move the cars. Just don't forget to take the keys out, that's all. Phone rings.
JERRY Hello? Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom, just slide it all the way over. You're welcome. New scene. Jerry and Elaine are in line at the rental car agency.
ELAINE I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading from one of his novels.
JERRY Owen March, I never heard of him.
ELAINE Well, he's not a baseball player.
JERRY Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty good.
ELAINE Yeah. Well, there is one little problem.
JERRY What's that?
ELAINE He's sixty-six years old.
RENTAL_CAR_AGENT Next please.
ELAINE Well, go, go.
AGENT Can I help you? Name please?
JERRY Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm kidding around, of course.
AGENT Okay, let's see here.
JERRY Sixty-six years old?
ELAINE Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. You'd really like him.
JERRY Why do people always say that? I hate everyone, why would I like him?
ELAINE What do you think, would you go out with a sixty-six year old woman?
JERRY Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant, she'd be spinning.
AGENT I'm sorry, we have no mid-size available at the moment.
JERRY I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?
AGENT Yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out of cars.
JERRY But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation.
AGENT I know why we have reservations.
JERRY I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to hold the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.
AGENT Let me, uh, speak with my supervisor. The agent goes into an office with a window in the door so she can be seen speaking with someone.
JERRY Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying over there?
ELAINE What?
JERRY Hey Marge, you see those two people over there? They think I'm talking to you, so you pretend like you're talking to me, okay now you start talking.
ELAINE Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something but I'm not really saying anything at all?
JERRY Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought I was checking with you.
ELAINE Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, see you later. The agent returns.
AGENT I'm sorry, my supervisor says there's nothing we can do.
JERRY Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there.
AGENT But we do have a compact if you would like that.
JERRY Fine.
AGENT Alright. We have a blue Ford Escort for you Mr. Seinfeld. Would you like insurance?
JERRY Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car.
AGENT Please fill this out.
ELAINE What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake?
JERRY Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important.
ELAINE I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's okay being with him. New scene. Elaine and Jerry are at Jerry's apartment.
ELAINE I just don't enjoy being with him.
JERRY Well that's what's important.
ELAINE I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, do I have to break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over the phone?
JERRY How many times you been out with him?
ELAINE Seven?
JERRY Face to face.
ELAINE Seven dates is a face-to-face break up?
JERRY If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over the limit. Unless, of course, there was no sex.
ELAINE Hmm... How's the pasta over there? Kramer enters, as he's walking in, George rushes in, pushes him out of the way and heads for the kitchen sink.
KRAMER Whoa, whoa!!
JERRY What is going on out there?
GEORGE I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating, I got an alarm that won't go off, I'm pressing 'one', I'm pressing 'two', nothing! What do I do?! Help me! Help me! George runs off into the bathroom.
KRAMER Hey, you know they were supposed to do my scene today?
ELAINE Today?!
KRAMER You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the block carrying this bag of groceries.
ELAINE Yeah.
KRAMER So I start to walk, and I trip, and the grocery bag goes flying, and Woody, Woody starts laughing.
ELAINE He was laughing?!
KRAMER Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out of his nose.
JERRY So then what?
KRAMER I got a line in the movie!
ELAINE Get out!
JERRY That's great!
GEORGE You got a line in the Woody Allen movie?
KRAMER Pretty good, huh?
GEORGE You're in the movie? Is he in the scene?
KRAMER Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him. I might have a whole new career on my hands, huh?
JERRY You mean a career.
ELAINE So was Mia Farrow there?
KRAMER Uh, I didn't see him.
ELAINE What's your line?
KRAMER Oh, well uh, okay I'm there with, uh, Woody, you know, I'm at this bar and, uh, I'm sit-- you know it's Woody Allen, did I mention that? The other three impatiently encourage Kramer to continue.
KRAMER So I'm sitting there with Woody and I say, I turn to him and I go, "Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty."
GEORGE Is that how you're gonna say it?
KRAMER No, no, I'm working on it.
ELAINE Do it like this. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."
JERRY No. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."
KRAMER No, no. See, that's no good. See, you don't know how to act.
GEORGE "These pretzels are making me thirsty!!" Jerry pinches his nose.
GEORGE That was no good?
KRAMER I didn't say anything.
ELAINE I'm gonna go break up with Owen.
GEORGE What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you know anything about this pretzel guy?! Maybe he's been in the bar a really long time and he's really depressed because he has no job and no woman and he's parking cars for a living! Alright! Alright! Shut up! Shut up! I hear you! I'm coming down! These pretzels are making me thirsty! George storms out. New scene. Still Jerry's apartment, some time later. There's a pounding on the door, Jerry opens it and Elaine enters with an unconscious older man.
JERRY Oh my god.
ELAINE Call an ambulance.
JERRY Boy, he took it hard. New scene. Owen is now lying on Jerry's couch and Elaine is explaining what happened.
ELAINE We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch.
JERRY Hello? Yes, I need an ambulance at one twenty nine west Eighty-first Street, apartment five-A.
ELAINE Tell then to hurry! Hurry!
JERRY It's an ambulance. I don't know but he's unconscious. Kramer enters.
KRAMER These pretzels are making me thirsty. Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty.
JERRY Kramer.
KRAMER What happened here?
ELAINE I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance, does anyone know first aid?
JERRY Shouldn't you do something with the extremities?
ELAINE What extremities?
KRAMER What's an extremity?
JERRY You raise the feet, get blood to the head.
KRAMER You raise the head, you get blood to the feet.
ELAINE Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that.
JERRY I don't have a washcloth.
ELAINE Well use a paper towel.
JERRY You can't put a paper towel on his head.
KRAMER What about a big sponge?
JERRY How you gonna hold it on there?
KRAMER Use a belt.
ELAINE No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him.
JERRY Should we walk him around?
ELAINE_AND_KRAMER Yes, yes.
KRAMER Yeah, I've seen them do that.
JERRY No, no that's for a drug overdose.
KRAMER Maybe that's what he's got.
ELAINE No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the table.
KRAMER Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking.
ELAINE He is not a drug addict!
JERRY Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, he might just need a cookie or something.
ELAINE A cookie!
KRAMER Can you give him a cookie?
ELAINE How's he gonna chew it?
JERRY We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him. Kramer puts a cookie into Owen's mouth and starts working his jaw up and down.
ELAINE Careful, you're getting crumbs all over him.
KRAMER I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow.
ELAINE You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink it.
JERRY Cookies don't liquefy.
ELAINE Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie.
KRAMER Alright I'll get a blender.
JERRY What blender? I don't have a blender.
KRAMER You got a blender.
JERRY I would know if I had a blender.
ELAINE Where is the ambulance?! Just then a siren can be heard followed by a skidding sound followed by a crashing sound. The frame dissolves out and in as if to show time passing.
JERRY Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five minutes ago.
ELAINE I can't believe what's going on out here.
JERRY This is an emergency, what's taking so long? Wait a second, maybe that's them. Hello?
VOICE Paramedics.
JERRY Come on up. Okay, they're here.
ELAINE He seems to be breathing.
JERRY Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy.
ELAINE I know.
JERRY Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?
ELAINE Almost.
JERRY Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there.
ELAINE It's not an easy thing to bring up.
JERRY Yeah, that's true.
ELAINE Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk.
JERRY Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers.
ELAINE He does, how'd you know that?
JERRY I could tell. Two paramedics enter with a stretcher.
ELAINE What happened, what took you so long?!
PARAMEDIC We got here twenty minutes ago but we couldn't move, the whole intersection is gridlocked, I've never seen anything like it. So finally we make the turn and this guy who's running around triple-parking cars slammed into us with a blue Escort.
JERRY Blue Escort? That's my rent-a-car! George enters, blotting his forehead with a washcloth.
GEORGE Oh man.
JERRY What happened to the car?
GEORGE Sorry, you don't know what's going on out there! Who's he?
ELAINE This guy I'm seeing.
GEORGE What happened?
JERRY We don't know!
PARAMEDIC Who put cookies in his mouth?
JERRY_AND_ELAINE Cookies?
PARAMEDIC You're not supposed to do that.
JERRY So how'd you hit the car?
GEORGE I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen and I got all distracted.
JERRY It's not even my car, it's a rental. Kramer enters.
KRAMER What are you doing out there?! You're holding up the production of the movie! We can't shoot and Woody, he's really mad at you.
GEORGE Woody mentioned me? What did he say?
KRAMER He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all screwed up?'
GEORGE Should I apologize to Woody?
KRAMER Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring it up. I'll feel him out. Mid-episode Monologue. What do you think first aid was like though, like hundreds of years ago? You know, I mean they had no medicine, no drugs, no technology, no equipment. Basically, they were there first. That was it, that was the whole first aid. They sit with you. That's all they could do. 'Can you help me?' 'No, no we can't help you, we were the first ones here, I don't know if you know that. Did you see out truck? First aid, that's our motto. We show up before anybody.' New scene. Jerry, George and Sid are in Jerry's apartment.
SID Now you didn't tell me you didn't know how to drive. You should have mentioned that.
GEORGE Well I know how to drive.
SID Then how'd all those cars get damaged? Why are people calling me up screaming on the phone? Most of them cancelled out on me.
JERRY Can I get anybody anything?
SID Moving cars from one side of the street to the other don't take no more sense than putting on a pair of pants. My question to you is who's putting your pants on?
GEORGE I put my pants on, Sid.
SID I don't believe you. If you can put your pants on, you can move those cars.
GEORGE Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.
SID Who's gonna send money to my sister in Virginia? Her little boy needs surgery on his foot. Now he'll be walking around with a limp because you can't park a few cars.
GEORGE Maybe I could call my father. Kramer enters holding a newspaper.
KRAMER Hey, you seen the paper yet?
JERRY Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper.
KRAMER Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer. Jerry Owen March, prominent author and essayist suffered a stroke yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend.
KRAMER Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. You're the friend.
JERRY The extent of the damage would have been far less severe had paramedics been able to reach him sooner.
SID Oh lord.
JERRY The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in New York were over. New scene. Elaine and Jerry are back at the car rental agency, Jerry's eating a bag of pretzels.
ELAINE Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with him. Five seconds. The next words out of my mouth were, 'Owen, it's over.'
JERRY Can he communicate?
ELAINE Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy it when I read to him.
JERRY Alright, she's free. Hi, I called before, uh, my car got smashed.
ELAINE So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now it'll look like I'm abandoning him because of his condition, I'll be ostracized from the community.
JERRY What community? There's a community?
ELAINE Of course there's a community.
JERRY All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea.
AGENT Sir the estimate on the damage to your car is two thousand eight hundred and sixty-six dollars.
JERRY Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so...
AGENT Yes, now, uh, in your report you said that you were not the driver of the car at the time of the accident.
JERRY That is right, somebody else was driving.
AGENT Alright, well, sir, you're only covered for when you're driving the car.
JERRY Uh huh, what's that?
AGENT You're not covered for other drivers.
JERRY Other drivers?
AGENT Um hm.
JERRY Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car. That's who's driving it, other drivers. Doesn't my credit card cover me or something?
AGENT Not that particular one.
JERRY Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you want, go ahead, whichever one, I don't care.
AGENT Sir, if you had read the rental agreement--
JERRY Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration of Independence, who's gonna read that?
AGENT Mr. Seinfeld, as it stands right now, you are not covered for that damage and there is absolutely nothing that can be done about that.
JERRY These pretzels are making me thirsty. New scene. Elaine and Owen are at Owen's apartment, Owen is in a wheelchair and in generally unresponsive as Elaine feeds him soup.
ELAINE Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean in the south, are they offended? Huh? Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like my Yankee Bean. Owen, I think we have to talk. I mean, uh, I have to talk. It would be nice if we could, but, uh, whatever. Um, don't get me wrong, I like coming here, and uh, feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills, that's good stuff. Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! But at this point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment to one person. I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common. For example, I like running in the park, bicycling, roller skating, tennis and skiing, and um, well, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now, Owen, it's a bitch to get here. It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to take the double-R. Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends. These pretzels are making me thirsty. New scene. Coffee shop. Elaine, Jerry and George are at their usual booth.
ELAINE Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked in a vomitorium for two weeks, could you actually die from the odor?
JERRY An overdose of odor? Good question.
GEORGE Do I smell?
ELAINE No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street subway today, it is disgusting. Guess who I bumped into. Owen.
JERRY Ahh.
GEORGE He's alright?
ELAINE Yeah, he's almost fully recovered. He told me he was just using me for sex. The waitress brings the check.
JERRY Let me get that.
GEORGE No no no, I got it.
JERRY Please.
GEORGE No come on, let me, let me. I smashed your car, it cost you over two thousand dollars,
JERRY Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it. Kramer enters and sits down.
JERRY What are you doing here?
KRAMER I got fired from the movie.
GEORGE Get out of here, why?
KRAMER Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 'These pretzels are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and I slammed the glass down on the bar and it shattered.
ELAINE Aww.
KRAMER Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, she came up to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that scene. Kramer drops a pair of gloves on the table. Jerry picks up the gloves.
JERRY Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud. I think the best part of a relationship is when you're sick. And the best part of being sick is when you're in a relationship. And if I was to get married, you know all those vows; for richer or for poorer, for better or for worse, all I need is the sickness. That, to me, is the most important one. Do you take this man in sickness? That's the only time I need somebody there. Rest of the time, go out, have a ball, do whatever you want, but if I get the sniffles, you better be there.
JERRY The other thing I love is when you're in the middle of a dream, and the alarm goes off. You incorporate the sound of the alarm into the dream, so you can keep sleeping. And you'll make any adjustment in the dream to do it. I was with Marie Antoinette in a dream last night, and she was on the guillotine, the blade came down, her head fell into the basket, it rolled over and she started singing Neil Diamond's 'Solitary Man'. And, I thought, "That is not my alarm going off. This is actually happening."
GEORGE June. It's June. Hey!
GEORGE It's June.
GEORGE June, June, June.
GEORGE Hey, he-hah. It's June, June.
GEORGE It's Juu-uu-une! Hey hay. Yes.
GEORGE I love Juu-uuu-uu-uune!
GEORGE June. Juune, baby!
JERRY What?
GEORGE The catering hall screwed up. The wedding is delayed until June. It's like a stay of execution.
JERRY Dead man walking.
GEORGE Ha-ha-hah. This is my lucky day.
JERRY Well, one outta twenty thousand. That's not bad.
GEORGE Yeah. Hey, wait a second, you know, good news for you too. Susan's best friend, Hallie? Broke up with her boyfriend.
JERRY She did?
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY So? Wheels?
GEORGE In motion. The wheels are in motion.
JERRY Beautiful.
GEORGE Aah, hey. If this works out, forget about it.
JERRY So, set it up. You know what, we could have dinner at the Friars Club.
GEORGE The Friars Club?
JERRY Yeah, I'm thinking of joining. Pat Cooper said he would put me up for membership.
KRAMER Hey everybody. Listen, uh, do me a favour, will you? I got a hot date tonight with Connie. Knock on my door, wake me up in twenty minutes, alright?
JERRY Catnap?
KRAMER No, no, no, no. This is evolutionary. I been reading this book, on Leonardo de Vinci. See, that means 'from Vinci', d'you know that?
JERRY That must be some book.
KRAMER Yeah, well, turns out that the master slept only twenty minutes every three hours. Now, that works out to two and a half extra days, that I'm awake per week, every week. Which means, if I live to be eighty, I will have lived the equivalent of a hundred and five years.
JERRY Just imagine how much more you'll accomplish.
KRAMER Oh, I got a lot of things in the hopper, buddy.
JERRY I didn't know you had a hopper.
KRAMER Oh, I got a hopper. A big hopper.
PETERMAN Alright, people, I'd like to begin with a hearty hail and well-met good fellow, to Bob Grossberg, who's joining us from Business Affairs.
BOB Thanks. Hi everybody.
PETERMAN Bob, we have a little baptism by fire for you, so to speak.
ELAINE Poor bastard.
PETERMAN I want you to handle all the fact-checking and the copy-editing for the new catalogue.
BOB Ah, could you repeat that?
PETERMAN Why don't you handle all the copy-editing?
BOB I..I'm sorry. What?
PETERMAN Copy-editing!
PETERMAN Eh, never mind. Elaine, you do it.
JERRY Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. Pat Cooper made a reservation for me. MAITRE D' Yes, Mr Seinfeld, but uhm, all gentlemen are required to wear jackets in the dining room.
JERRY Oh, I'm sorry.
HALLIE How embarrassing this must be for you.
JERRY You just bought your own dinner.
MAITRED No problem. Please, follow me.
JERRY 'Scuse me.
GEORGE Ho ho. Funny. Isn't he funny? Funny guy. Ha ha ha.
GEORGE Friars.
JERRY Hey, not bad. I kinda like this little thing here. r.
MAITRED This way please.
GEORGE Hup, here we go. Here we go.
GEORGE Ah, c'mon! I'm telling you, I can coach for the NFL. It's not that hard
SUSAN Mmm, mm, mm. Hallie taste this fish. It's really delicious.
JERRY That might be the stupidest thing you've ever said.
GEORGE Oh, get outta here.
JERRY I mean, come on. No, the stupidest thing you ever said was when you said Steve Kroft from Sixty Minutes is the same guy from Seals and Croft.
HALLIE Mmm, it is good.
SUSAN What do you think about having fish for the wedding?
GEORGE You watch the old videos. I'm telling you, look at him.
HALLIE Oh. Remember wedding?
JERRY Oh, come on.
GEORGE Look...
JERRY Alright.
JERRY This is nice.
KRAMER Yeah, morning.
JERRY Morning?
KRAMER Yeah, what time is it?
JERRY Ten-thirty.
KRAMER Ah, see. I got the whole night ahead of me. Boy, that's a nice jacket, huh?
JERRY Ohh, I don't believe this. I forgot to give it back. It belongs to the Friars Club.
KRAMER Yeah, I like that crest. Alright, here we go.
JERRY Breakfast?
KRAMER Oh yeah. Most important meal of the day.
JERRY So this Da Vinci sleep is working out?
KRAMER Oh, I'm percolating, Jerry. I'm telling you, I have never felt so fertile. I'm mossy, Jerry. My brain is mossy. Listen to this idea. A restaurant that serves only peanut butter and jelly.
JERRY What d'you call it?
KRAMER P B and J's. What d'you think?
JERRY I think you need more sleep.
KRAMER Ahh.
JERRY So, how'd your date work out with the mysterious Connie?
KRAMER I am telling you, this woman is strange. She never wants to leave the apartment. It's almost like she doesn't wanna be seen with me.
JERRY Oh, now you're being ridiculous.
KRAMER He he, yeah.
JERRY No milk?
KRAMER Oh, I'll be back.
KRAMER Jerry. Hey Jerry. C'mon buddy.
JERRY Kramer!
KRAMER You awake?
JERRY Wha..? What time is it?
KRAMER W...It's four.
JERRY Four in the morning?!
KRAMER Yeah.
JERRY Well, what's wrong with you?
KRAMER I'm bored. I got all this free time on my hands, I dunno what to do. You wanna do something?
JERRY No. Would you just get out?
KRAMER You wanna rent a movie?
JERRY No!
KRAMER Well, what am I gonna do?
JERRY Ready for lunch?
ELAINE I'm stuck here, editing the stupid catalogue, because of stupid Bob Grossberg.
ELAINE Listen, there is something really suspicious about this guy. Every time Mr Peterman tries to assign him any work, he says he can't hear, and it all gets dumped on me.
JERRY You think he's faking?
ELAINE I don't know. But I'd like to try that earpiece on, see if it's real.
BOB Hey Elaine. Oh, you have a friend.
BOB Just wanted to say hi.
ELAINE Bob, you know what? I'm kinda swamped here. You think you could give me a hand with some of the catalogue?
BOB I..I'm sorry. What?
ELAINE I'm kind of swamped.
BOB Thank you. I'm having lunch with Mr P. I better get going.
ELAINE Did you see that? Did you see that, Jerry?
JERRY That was him?
ELAINE Yes.
JERRY Somehow I thought he'd be taller.
ELAINE Alright, listen, we'll have to do this again some other time, okay? I got a lotta work to do.
JERRY Alright, I'll see you later.
ELAINE Alright.
JERRY Hey, Bob.
JERRY Bob.
JERRY Hey, Bobby, over here.
JERRY Bob. Oh, Bob.
JERRY Bob!
BOB Hi.
JERRY Elaine.
ELAINE 
JERRY I was just in the bathroom.
ELAINE Okay, Jerry, please, please. I'm really busy here.
JERRY No, no, no. I was just in the bathroom with that Bob guy.
ELAINE So what?
JERRY No, I kinda tried to test his hearing.
ELAINE Get out! What'd you do?
JERRY Well, I kinda snuck up behind him at the urinal and tried to see if he could hear me.
ELAINE And?
JERRY Well, he flinched, sort of.
ELAINE What d'you mean, sort of? What'd he do?
JERRY Well, he kinda moved his head, you know. It mighta been on the zip up, I dunno.
ELAINE So you don't know anything?
JERRY Actually, no.
ELAINE Alright, good job.
JERRY Right.
JERRY Come in.
GEORGE Last night, huh? Was that something, or was that something?
JERRY That was something.
GEORGE Ah. She's great, isn't she?
JERRY Fantastic. Fantastic woman.
GEORGE I told you.
JERRY I'm nuts about her.
GEORGE You think she could be an 'it'? Could she be an 'it'?
JERRY She could be an 'it'.
GEORGE We might have an 'it'!
JERRY She's got 'it' written all over her.
GEORGE She's got everything, right? She's intelligent, she's smart, she's got a great sense of humour.
JERRY Well, I dunno. I didn't really talk to her.
GEORGE Well, she's smart. You take my word for it.
JERRY Whatever.
GEORGE Hehee. W..we could be like the Gatsbys. Didn't they always like, you know, a bunch of people around, and they were all best friends?
JERRY That doesn't sound right.
GEORGE No. So, tonight she's got tickets for that show she's been working on. The Flying Sandos Brother.
JERRY Flying Sandos. Beautiful.
GEORGE Great. Seven-thirty, alright?
JERRY Walk me down to the Friars.
GEORGE Sure. So, uh, Jerry, there's an empty apartment in my building. If you and Hallie want, we could try and hold it, may...
JERRY It's not here.
GEORGE What?
JERRY Th..the jacket, it's not here. It's gotta be here somewhere.
KRAMER Oh, boy.
JERRY Thanks for that four a.m. wakeup call last night. Where the hell is that jacket?
KRAMER Oh, the one with the crest.
JERRY Yeah.
JERRY Oh, well, that's at the cleaners.
JERRY The cleaners? How did it get there?
KRAMER Well, I, uh, I borrowed it last night and it got a little dirty.
JERRY Great.
KRAMER Somehow I dozed off and woke up in a pile of garbage.
JERRY Somehow? You've had an hour and twenty minutes sleep in three days!
KRAMER Well, so, look, the cleaner said you could pick it up tonight at six.
JERRY Alright. I just hope I can get it to the Friars Club before the show.
GEORGE Won't be a problem...
JERRY Hey.
JERRY Hey!!
KRAMER Watch out, boy.
ELAINE Can you give us a hand with some of these boxes, Bob?
ELAINE Bob!
ELAINE I want you so bad, Bob. You turn me on...
ELAINE ...so much. You're so damn...sexy.
ELAINE Ohh. I'm starting to unbutton.
ELAINE Anything getting through? Bob?
HALLIE Well, they perform all over. Europe mostly.
GEORGE A-ha, huh. tours.
HALLIE Yeah.
JERRY Sorry, sorry I'm late.
GEORGE_AND_SUSAN Hey!
SUSAN Jerry.
GEORGE Isn't that the uh, Friars Club jacket?
JERRY Yeah, it wasn't ready on time. I have to return it after the show.
GEORGE Sure, sure, sure, sure. How about these seats? Are these fantastic, huh? Huh? I feel like Lincoln.
JERRY Yeah. Well, let's hope this evening turns out a little better.
KRAMER So, uhm, are you sure you don't wanna go to the movies?
CONNIE Mmm, no, Cosmo. I like just being here with you.
KRAMER Oh, it's uh, it's a bold adventure.
KRAMER Ooh. Well, this is uh, risky business, huh? I'm all a-twitter.
SANDOS_BROTHER_1 How would you kind people like to lend a hand with our next trick?
JERRY I don't think so.
SANDOS_BROTHER_1 Please, take off your jacket.
JERRY My jacket?
SANDOS_BROTHER_1 Yes, the jacket. What do you say, ladies and gentlemen?
SANDOS_BROTHER_1 Can't argue with that.
HALLIE C'mon.
SUSAN Do it. Come on, Jerry.
GEORGE Give him the jacket.
JERRY Alright.
SANDOS_BROTHER_1 And now, we say the magic word. Agrabah! And we make it disappear.
CONNIE Oh Cosmo. Mm-mmm, Cosmo. Oh Cosmo.
CONNIE Uh, honey, can you move a little, this hurts.
CONNIE Cosmo?
CONNIE Oh my god. Cosmo, wake up!
CONNIE Cosmo?
CONNIE Oh my god! He's dead! He's dead.
CONNIE Yeah, Tommy, this is Connie. You gotta help me. Some guy dropped dead on top of me. I can't call the cops, 'cos Joey might find out. I can't. I'm stuck. You gotta help me.
GEORGE This is very exciting. The inner sanctum.
JERRY Hi. I..I was in the audience earlier. You threw my jacket down. I just wanted to pick it up.
SANDOS_BROTHER_2 Jacket? What jacket?
JERRY I had a jacket with a crest on it. You came into the audience, you threw it away. Agrabah.
SANDOS_BROTHER_2 A..are you sure it was me?
JERRY Well, it was either you or one of your brothers.
SANDOS_BROTHER_2 Well, two of them have left already.
SANDOS_BROTHER_2 No.
JERRY It doesn't even belong to me. It belongs to the Friars Club.
SANDOS_BROTHER_2 Sorry.
HALLIE Jerry, I'm sure it'll turn up.
JERRY I'm sure it won't.
HALLIE Don't worry. I'll get the jacket back.
GEORGE Alright, there you go. She's gonna get the jacket back. So, let's go get some coffee, huh?
JERRY No, I'm a little tired. I think I'll go home.
SUSAN Aww, that's too bad.
GEORGE Really?
JERRY Yeah, we'll do it another time.
SUSAN George, we'll go.
GEORGE I, uh, oh, broke a shoelace today.
SUSAN Oh, I can get you shoelaces tomorrow.
GEORGE Okay.
SUSAN So, what colour?
GEORGE Brown.
GEORGE Maybe a black.
SUSAN Mmm.
WAITRESS More coffee?
GEORGE No! Check! Please.
JERRY That nut is always up to something.
KRAMER Hey!! Sh..! Shii! Mama!! AAH! AAGH!
PETERMAN Elaine. I think I've been working you a little too hard, lately.
ELAINE Oh.
PETERMAN So, I have two tickets for you to the Flying Sandos Brothers magic show.
ELAINE Ah.
PETERMAN It is a real hoot.
ELAINE Well, thank you Mr Peterman.
PETERMAN Ah, the tickets are for tonight. So you and Bob can knock off a little early, so you both can get ready.
ELAINE Mr Peterman, you...
PETERMAN There's no need to deny it, Elaine. I heard every word you said.
PETERMAN And I know you wouldn't be just having fun with his handicap. That kind of cruelty would be grounds for dismissal.
ELAINE Of course, Mr Peterman.
JERRY Tell 'em I'll come down and talk to 'em. Okay, bye. Well, that was the Friars Club. D'you think they're gonna let a jacket-stealer join? I don't think so! They're gonna charge me eight hundred dollars for the jacket, and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper!
JERRY Wh..what kinda show is that Sandos Brothers? They take your jacket, then they just throw it? I never heard of that!
GEORGE It's a little unusual. So, uh, Susan and I were thinking, uh, dinner at our house Saturday night. Just the four of us.
JERRY Uhh, I don't think so.
GEORGE Why not?
JERRY Ah, I'm a little turned off.
GEORGE C'mon, what're you talking about?
JERRY Ahh, I'm, I'm kinda soured.
GEORGE You're soured?
JERRY Yeah, I'm soured.
GEORGE Don't be soured.
JERRY I'm sorry. I'm soured.
GEORGE What're you kidding me? We were all getting along so well. Where is all this coming from?
JERRY Well, you know, frankly, I don't think she was too concerned about my jacket.
GEORGE What're you talking about?! She's very concerned! She said she was gonna get it back.
JERRY Yeah, we'll see.
GEORGE Because if she gets it back, then you'll have no reason to be sour. You'll de-sour, right?
JERRY I'll try and de-sour.
GEORGE Oh, that's not good enough! You don't try and de-sour. You have to sweeten too!
JERRY I'll try! I'll try and de-sour and sweeten.
GEORGE I wanna get it back when we were the Gatsbys.
JERRY I still don't know what that means.
GEORGE Yeah, well.
KRAMER God.
JERRY Oh god! What happened to you?!
KRAMER She tried to kill me Jerry!
JERRY Who?
KRAMER Connie!
JERRY What'd she do?
KRAMER I don't know! But I woke up in the Hudson river in a Sack!! I think she drugged me, but she's a murderer and I'm calling the cops.
JERRY Why would she try and kill you?
KRAMER Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't want anybody else to have me!
KRAMER Gah!
JERRY Hey, there's uncle Milty.
GEORGE Yeah, it is.
JERRY And there's David Steinberg.
GEORGE The comedian, or the manager?
JERRY The manager.
JERRY Hey, there's Pat. Hey, Pat.
PAT Hey, Jerry. What the hell went wrong? What's the matter with you? Are you a kleptomaniac, or what?
JERRY I forgot to take it off.
PAT You forgot to take it off? Oh, you go into a department store, you put a suit on, and you walk right out. What are you some sort of an idiot?
JERRY I'm sorry.
PAT Where's the jacket?
JERRY Well, one of the gypsies took it.
PAT Aww, the gypsies took it! Of course, New York has a lot of gypsies! Oh, on every block there's a gypsy!
GEORGE Well, it's true. I saw it.
PAT Excuse me, are you an entertainer? Are you in showbusiness?
GEORGE No, I uh...
PAT Then what am I talking to you for? Jerry, bring the jacket back tomorrow.
JERRY Alright.
GEORGE Wait a minute, wait a minute.
GEORGE Look at that guy. Right there. Isn't that the guy from the show? He's..he's wearing the jacket.
JERRY God, you're right.
GEORGE C'mon.
MAITRED Wait a second! Excuse me gentlemen, are you members?
JERRY Well, I'm a prospective member.
MAITRED Until then, that's the way out.
JERRY But that guy has my jacket.
MAITRED C'mon, let's go.
GEORGE Excuse me, the guy is wearing a jacket that my friend is...
MAITRED Come on.
JERRY Come on.
MAITRED Let's go.
GEORGE If I could talk to the guy for just a sec...
BOB These seats are fantastic. It was really nice of Mr Peterman to give us these tickets.
ELAINE Yeah, yeah. Was nice.
BOB Yeah. Got our own little private box here, don't we?
ELAINE Get offa me! Stop it. Stop it.
ELAINE Get offa me!
ELAINE Get a hold of yourself, Bob! Get a hold of yourself!
JERRY I dunno how that guy gave us the slip at the Friars Club.
GEORGE I told you, he probably went out the back.
JERRY Ouf. Jerry recognises the guy.
JERRY Hey. It's you! Th..that's my Friars Club jacket!
SANDOS_BROTHER_1 No, it is not. It is my jacket.
JERRY No, no, no. That's my jacket, give it back.
SANDOS_BROTHER_1 No, it is not. This is mine.
JERRY C'mon I need it.
JERRY I wanna join. I need it to become a member.
GEORGE Give 'im the jacket already!
SANDOS_BROTHER_1 Help! Help! Azobar! Azobar disay!
GEORGE What's he yelling about? They're stealing jackets here!
JERRY Can you believe it?!
JERRY Hey George, you know what? I think this crest is different. It's got a moose on it.
GEORGE Moose?
JERRY Yeah. I don't think this is the jacket.
HALLIE No, it's not.
HALLIE This is the jacket.
JERRY Ohh, you got the jacket back.
GEORGE Ohh, yeahh.
JERRY Thank you.
HALLIE It got a little dirty, so they wanted to clean it before they gave it back to you.
JERRY Oh. Oh, that's nice of 'em.
GEORGE That is really nice.
HALLIE Yeah.
JERRY Yeah.
HALLIE Yeah.
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE This is nice.
JERRY Yeahh.
HALLIE Yeah.
GEORGE Hey, you know, let's call Susan, we'll go have coffee.
HALLIE I'll see you at the wedding.
GEORGE Great! Now she's sour!
JERRY Maybe she'll sweeten.
GEORGE She won't sweeten, and I'm bitter!
SANDOS_BROTHER_1 There they are!
GEORGE Here. We'll leave it here for you!
KRAMER That's her, officer.
CONNIE Kramer! Oh my god, I thought you were...
KRAMER What? Sleeping with the fishes? I guess I woke up!
DETECTIVE You're under arrest for the attempted murder of Cosmo Kramer.
CONNIE I didn't do anything.
KRAMER Oh, yeah! Yeah!
DETECTIVE Get your coat, we gotta take you in.
CONNIE Can I call my lawyer?
DETECTIVE Okay, go ahead.
CONNIE You gotta meet me at the police station. They're arresting me for attempted murder.
JACKIE Attempted murder? Of whom?
CONNIE This guy, Kramer.
JACKIE Oh. Cosmo Kramer?
CONNIE Yeah, that's right.
JACKIE I don't want nothing to do with it.
NINA Kramer, would you hold still? I can't do this if you keep moving.
KRAMER You sure you don't want me to take my clothes off? I'll do it!
NINA No, that's the last thing in the world I want you to do.
KRAMER Well, why don't you take your clothes off?
NINA I don't know... I don't think Jerry would like that.
KRAMER Well, it'd be our little secret.
GEORGE Button fly! Why do they put buttons on a fly? It takes ten minutes to get these things open!
JERRY I like the button fly.
GEORGE What?
JERRY That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth. It's like a mink trap down there. What are you doing today?
GEORGE Nothing.
JERRY I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her paintings?
GEORGE I don't get art.
JERRY There's nothing to get.
GEORGE Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have someone explain the explanation.
JERRY She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer right now.
GEORGE What for?
JERRY She sees something in him.
GEORGE So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall.
KRAMER Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown. Or, really, they're dark brown, like rich, Columbian coffee.
NINA Tell me about Elaine.
KRAMER She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.
NINA But, they're still friends.
KRAMER Oh yeah, they're like this .
NINA Don't you think that's strange?
KRAMER Why, what's the difference?
NINA Well, are you still friends with any of your ex-girlfriends?
KRAMER Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships.
GEORGE You know, I'm a little nervous.
JERRY Why?
GEORGE Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel like I'm getting fixed up for a friendship.
JERRY I don't know how long this is gonna last.
GEORGE Really? I thought you liked her.
JERRY I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having fun with anyone but her.
GEORGE You know, it's a miracle you're not married. Hey, I'm not obligated to buy anything, am I?
JERRY Hi, Nina. This is my friend George.
NINA How nice to meet you, I've heard a lot about you.
JERRY Hey, look at this guy!
KRAMER Yeah!
JERRY I brought George up to see some of your paintings.
NINA Oh, are you interested?
GEORGE Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested.
KRAMER George, you gonna buy a painting?
GEORGE Yeah, sure.
NINA Are you an art-lover?
GEORGE I am an art-adorer! I adore art.
NINA Great! Well, take a look around. Pick out something you like.
JERRY May I?
NINA Get outta here! Here, play with this. Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm going out of town.
NINA Oh, well. I'm not gonna go without you. Do you guys want 'em?
KRAMER Yeah.
JERRY They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!
GEORGE Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them?
NINA Oh, my father's the Yankees accountant... it's the owner's box.
GEORGE All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the dugout!
NINA You like that one?
GEORGE Look at where we are! He's not stopping! He just keeps going and going and going! We're not in the first row?
USHER No, no, these are your seats.
GEORGE She said first row! Right behind the dugout!
ELAINE Well, it's the second row. It's just as good.
GEORGE I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my feet up on the dugout!
ELAINE Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than this.
GEORGE Oh, there's better, right there, that's better.
KRAMER Right. Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog? What a great day!
ELAINE I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.
GEORGE You're supposed to do that?
ELAINE Yeah. What makes you think anyone would want to go to a circumcision?
GEORGE I'd rather go to a hanging.
ELAINE Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father in the hospital in Maryland.
KRAMER You better catch it, Johnny, cause this ain't Philidelphia!
MAN George?
GEORGE Yeah?
MAN Hi. I'm Leonard West, Nina's father.
GEORGE Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine--
ELAINE Hi!
KRAMER Hey, 230 ain't gonna cut it in this town babe!
GEORGE --and this is Kramer.
KRAMER Oh, hey.
WEST So how are the seats?
GEORGE Okay.
ELAINE Great, great.
KRAMER Yeah.
WEST George, I heard you bought one of Nina's paintings.
GEORGE Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs. Not, uh, too expensive, is it?
WEST Well, if you have a lot of money.
WEST Well, enjoy the game. I think you better take off that Orioles cap.
ELAINE Yeah. I better!
WEST No, no, no. Seriously. You're in the owner's box, and I don't think it's a good idea.
ELAINE You're not serious.
WEST Yes, yes, yes, I am!
ELAINE Well, did he say that?
WEST No, no, but he gave me the seats. I don't think he'd like it if you wore an Orioles cap.
ELAINE Well maybe you should ask him!
WEST I don't have to ask him! Now are you gonna take the hat off or not?
ELAINE No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This is ridiculous!!
GEORGE Just take the cap off.
ELAINE George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!
WEST Look. Either you take the cap off, or you'll have to leave.
ELAINE Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off.
GEORGE Just take the cap off!
ELAINE No!
KRAMER Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here!
GEORGE Do you want us to go with you?
KRAMER I'll go get your hat, George.
ELAINE Stay!
GEORGE Okay, we'll go!
ELAINE ...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over the railing!
JERRY Is he okay?
ELAINE Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room, and you know, the x-rays were all negative. It was quite a day!
JERRY This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane!
ELAINE I know! Can you imagine that?
JERRY How you feeling?
KRAMER Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. Hey, we made the paper. Eh? Look at this- page 2, sports section... we're all in the picture.
ELAINE Wha- a picture?
KRAMER A picture.
ELAINE Our picture's in there?
KRAMER Uh-huh.
ELAINE I cannot believe this!
JERRY There's George!
KRAMER Yup, yup!
ELAINE Ohmygod! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting my father! Oh my g-I make up one little white lie and they put my picture in the paper!
ELAINE Hi, Mr. Lippman.
LIPPMAN How's your father?
ELAINE My, my father?
LIPPMAN Yeah. You, you went to see him, right?
ELAINE Yeah.
LIPPMAN Uh-huh.
ELAINE I went to visit him.
LIPPMAN Uh-huh. So, what was wrong with him?
ELAINE Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia...
LIPPMAN But--but he's feeling better now?
ELAINE Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit must have buoyed his spirits.
LIPPMAN Boo-eed.
ELAINE What--what did I say?
LIPPMAN You said "boyed."
ELAINE I did?
LIPPMAN Yeah.
LIPPMAN Well, I got a plane to catch.
ELAINE Oh! Where are you going?
LIPPMAN Going to Houston. It's a publisher's convention. Can I have my sports section?
ELAINE Ah. ...Yeah.
LIPPMAN I've been saving it for the plane. I never miss the Sunday sports section.
ELAINE There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You know, the Yankees won, the Mets lost, Ricky Henderson's unhappy...
LIPPMAN Right, right. What, what are you doing?
ELAINE Wha-- oh! Oh, god! That is the third time today I have done that! Blaah! Grabbing newspapers... I'm just tugging at 'em...
LIPPMAN Gotta go.
ELAINE Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, and uh... alrighty! I'll just hold down the, uh, fort!
MRS._ARM I sense great vulcrability. A land child crying out for love, an innocent orphan in the post-modern world.
MR._ARM I see a parasite.
MRS._ARM A sexually-depraved miscrient, who is seeking to gratify only his most basic and immediate urges.
NINA She was a guest of my father's. She should've taken the cap off.
JERRY It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game. How can you defend that?
MRS._ARM He is struggled, he is man-struggled. He lifts my spirit!
MR._ARM He is a loathsome, offensive brute, yet I can't look away.
JERRY Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other.
NINA Oh, well, you wouldn't want that because you always have to remain friends!
JERRY Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!
NINA Hey -- why don't you just go then! And -- oh, give this to George. Tell him he owes me $500!
MRS._ARM He transcends time and space.
MR._ARM He sickens me.
MRS._ARM I love it.
MR._ARM Me too.
GEORGE Five-hundred dollars?! What?
JERRY That's what she told me!
GEORGE I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk!
JERRY That's what it costs!
GEORGE Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!
JERRY I wasn't thinking! I don't know.
GEORGE You weren't thinking.
JERRY Well, she framed it and everything.
GEORGE Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this! I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly lines! Are you telling me you couldn't paint this?
JERRY Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint you some- thing!
GEORGE I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her, it'd be a different story.
KRAMER This was in front of your door.
GEORGE Hey, Kramer.
KRAMER Hi, Mike.
JERRY Wow, a letter from Nina!
KRAMER Whoa, man! That is the ugliest thing I've ever seen!
JERRY Oh my god!
GEORGE What?
JERRY This is amazing, you can't believe this!
GEORGE What's it say?
JERRY Listen to this: "I don't know what you expect to find out there, Jerry, you know what you want better than me. But there's one thing I do know. I know I can stand here watching you destroy everything I've ever wanted in my life, wanting to smash your face with my fists, because you won't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness and still know that I love you. You mean so much to me that I'm will- ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity."
GEORGE Wow!
KRAMER She's deep.
JERRY "...'cause that's what you need to do to prove I'm not going to leave you. I'm sick and tired of running from places and people and relationships. You want me, that fight for me, becau-" "...because I'm sure as hell fighting for you!"
KRAMER You know Jerry, she sounds like a poet!
JERRY No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about her!
KRAMER Yeah! Get in there and give her a call. Pick up the phone and call her!
JERRY Should I?
KRAMER Yes! You're damn right you should! Fight for her, Jerry, she's sure as hell fighting for you!
JERRY All right, all right! I'll call her.
JERRY Shot! I told ya! Yeah?
GEORGE It's George.
JERRY Come on up. Well, now we gotta get a posse together. I love a good posse.
NINA What's the appeal of the posse?
JERRY The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away from the job, camp out, you're with your friends... Come on, it's a week-long game of hide-and-seek on horseback.
NINA Hello, George.
GEORGE Hey, Nina! I owe you some money, don't I?
NINA Well, I really love that piece.
GEORGE Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, in fact, I've been thinking about it, and I feel like I'm stealing from you! Five-hundred dollars! It's gonna be worth thousands soon! You know what? On second thought, I can't even accept it.
NINA No, no no no, George! A deal's a deal. I want you to have it!
GEORGE This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with me! It should really be in a doormanned building.
NINA Honestly, George, the money's not important.
GEORGE Who said anything about money?
JERRY Yeah?
ELAINE It's Elaine.
JERRY Come on up.
NINA Elaine?
JERRY ...Yeah.
NINA This person does not believe in telephones, does she?
JERRY She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in. He likes the pop-in, too.
GEORGE I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy.
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE How 'bout Kramer.
JERRY Huge pop-in guy!
NINA Well, I was leaving anyway, so, uh, we're on for tomorrow?
JERRY Yeah.
NINA Okay.
JERRY Okay!
NINA Bye.
ELAINE Hello!
ELAINE Chatty gal. Lippman's coming back tomorrow, I'll be fired!
JERRY If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston!
ELAINE No, he wants to torture me. later on that night. George, Elaine, and Jerry are watching TV.
ELAINE Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when you're the clicker! You go too fast!
JERRY I'm a great clicker! Great instincts. How dare you impune my clicking.
ELAINE You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! I've never seen you stay on anything for more than 5 seconds. Gimme that.
JERRY Let go!
ELAINE No, come on! I want it, Jerry!
JERRY Let go, Elaine!
ELAINE Well at least let George do it!
JERRY Oh, George can't click!
GEORGE Give it! Give it! Pinheads.
JERRY Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that.
ELAINE It's Chapter 2, it's Neil Simon.
JERRY Wait a second... wait a second!! The letter, that's the letter!
ELAINE What letter?
JERRY This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie!
JERRY "...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness still know that I love you!!"
GEORGE This is incredible!
JERRY I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She cop- ied it right out of Chapter 2! She a thief, a bunko-artist!
GEORGE Maybe I won't send her that check.
ELAINE You know, it's not really that terrible.
JERRY What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented herself! I don't offer happiness. I offer happiness! James Caan doesn't offer happiness!
LIPPMAN ...yeah, yeah. But she wouldn't take the cap off? But didn't she know they were the owner's seats? Aw, that's unbelievable. Yeah. Okay. Alright Lenny, thanks again. Take care. That was Lenny West, my accountant, who is a hell of a guy. And he handles the Yankees too; it's his biggest account. So every once in a while they throw him a couple of seats and last weekend he gave them to his daughter. She's an artist, by the way. Anyway, her daughter gives 'em to some friends, you know. One of her friends shows up wearing a Baltimore cap! You're from Baltimore, right?
ELAINE Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is near Baltimore.
LIPPMAN Yeah, but you're an Oriole fan, right?
ELAINE Well, uh, fan. My father--
LIPPMAN Anyway, she refused to take the cap off; caused a whole big scene!
ELAINE Really?
LIPPMAN Yeah.
ELAINE So... impudent.
LIPPMAN Yeah, so Lenny gave me the tickets for tomorrow night. I'm inviting Frank and Marsha. 'Wantcha to come.
ELAINE Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li--
LIPPMAN Well, break 'em. You missed the bris, I want you at the game.
ELAINE Okay.
LIPPMAN Good. Oh--and Elaine. You know the Baltimore cap you got in your office? Wear it. I'm gonna have a little fun with him.
ELAINE That will be fun.
JERRY How's it coming?
NINA Good, good.
JERRY Seen any good movies lately?
NINA No... not really. You?
JERRY No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil Simon?
NINA Neil Simon? Uh, some of his stuff.
JERRY I've seen most of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh... Chapter 2. Have you ever seen that?
NINA I don't know... maybe.
JERRY I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night. Happened to catch it. I couldn't help notice a stunning similiarity--
MR._ARM Well, we've made our decision. We want "The Kramer."
GEORGE Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000?
JERRY Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!
GEORGE So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?
JERRY Yeah. And by the way, can you get this thing outta my house?
GEORGE Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you right now for ten bucks.
TV Uh, there's seems to be a lot of trouble in the area just behind the Yankee dugout.
GEORGE Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other day.
TV Well, we're not going to show it, we don't want to encourage that kind of behavior. Say, it's a young lady, and boy she's really going at it with the security guard. She's a fiesty one. And now they're getting the other security guard to come down. How do you like that Seegers? Boy, she's someting. And a ball to left field..."
KRAMER ...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and hopped a steamship to Sweden. This steak is excellent, by the way.
MRS._ARM More potatoes?
KRAMER Yeah, sure. Please.
MR._ARM Yes, yes. Go on. You hopped a steamship to Sweden?
KRAMER Yeah. And, it was a big one.
JERRY Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?
ELAINE Na.
JERRY What are you doing? We're going out for dinner in ten minutes.
ELAINE Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE It's George.
JERRY Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. You've got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?
ELAINE I don't know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?
JERRY I think I'll take out the garbage.
ELAINE Hey, have you ever fasted?
JERRY Well, once I didn't have dinner until, like 9:00 o'clock, that was pretty rough. Hey, do me a favour will ya'? Throw out my garbage for me.
GEORGE Yeah, right.
JERRY Come on, it's just down the hall.
GEORGE Give me two bucks. I'll do it for two bucks.
JERRY I'll give you 50 cents.
GEORGE There's no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.
JERRY Come on. Fifty cents. a piece of Drake's coffee cake
GEORGE You're not getting no Drake's Coffee Cake for fifty cents. Yae, Hey, I'm all set. I got the ticket. I'm going to the Cayman Islands this Friday.
JERRY I don't get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What do you need a break from getting up at eleven?
GEORGE It's an incredible deal. I don't know why you don't come with me.
JERRY Nah, I don't go for these non-refundable deals. I can't commit to a woman. I'm not going to commit to an airline.
GINA Hi.
JERRY Hi.
GINA How are you?
JERRY Gina, do you know what a Drake's Coffee Cake is?
GINA Of course, the plane cake with the sweet brown crumbs on the top.
JERRY How much do they cost?
GINA The junior?
GEORGE No, no the full size.
JERRY No, no the junior.
GEORGE You didn't say "junior".
GINA I haven't had one of those since I was a little girl.
JERRY Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! How ya' doing?
MARTIN Good enough.
JERRY Boy she's sexy isn't she?
JERRY Do you believe that guy?
ELAINE What guy?
JERRY My neighbour:
ELAINE Oh, that creepy guy?
JERRY Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?
GEORGE He didn't seem too pleased.
ELAINE Maybe I'll get a steak with french fried onion wings.
GEORGE hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream about that guy last night. This is amazing.
JERRY What's so amazing? You've seen him before.
GEORGE I haven't seen him for months.
JERRY What was the dream?
GEORGE I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.
JERRY I think I've played there.
GEORGE I've had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.
JERRY You're a little paranormal
ELAINE Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.
GEORGE Really?
ELAINE Uh uh, you should go some time.
GEORGE I'd love to go. Make an appointment.
JERRY Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job?
GEORGE I just got fired.
JERRY Alright, come on, lets get out of here.
ELAINE I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.
JERRY I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.
ELAINE Really?
JERRY Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits.
JERRY Who is it? Who is it?
GINA It's Gina.
JERRY Who?
GINA Martine's girl friend.
JERRY Martine?
GINA You next door neighbour.
JERRY Oh, Martin!
GEORGE It's Martine. I think he's dying. He tried to kill himself with pills.
JERRY What?
GINA Come on.
JERRY In my pajamas? I better get my robe.
GINA We don't have enough time.
JERRY It'll take two seconds.
GINA There is no time.
JERRY We don't have two seconds?
GINA All right. Go ahead.
JERRY Nah, forget it.
GINA No, go ahead.
JERRY Nah. I'll just wear the pajamas.
GINA Will you just get it.
JERRY Are you sure?
GINA Forget it. Come on.
JERRY Nah, I'll go get the robe.
JERRY That's not too bad. It's not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.
GINA You know why he did this? Because I told him it was over. I did not want to see him anymore.
JERRY Really? It's over?
GINA I could not stand it another minute. Yesterday he turned over a man's hot dog stand because he thought the man was looking at me. And then after he saw you in the hall. Ach, he was crazy with jealousy.
JERRY Oh boy, did he say anything about me?
GINA He does not like you. And all indications are he does not like Drake's Coffee Cake.
JERRY He said that?
GINA He was screaming about it all night. How it's too sweet and it falls apart when you eat it.
JERRY I'm sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.
GINA I wasn't.
JERRY You weren't?
GINA No, I have thought about you many times. Have you thought about me?
JERRY Of course.
GINA Tell me everything.
JERRY Are you sure he can't hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.
GINA I wish he was not in a coma. I wish he was dead. I wish I could pull the plug out from him.
JERRY I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how they're going to look at a thing like this.
GINA I saw you looking at your watch. You want to leave? Go ahead.
JERRY No, I just wanted to see what time it was.
GINA Are you afraid of him?
JERRY No.
GINA Then kiss me.
JERRY Here?
GINA Yes, right here.
JERRY Is this the proper venue?
GINA You don't want to?
JERRY No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.
GINA Then kiss me right in front of him.
JERRY I can't. What if he wakes up?
GINA A man is lying here unconscious and you're afraid of him? What kind of a man are you?
JERRY A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guy's got a coma going like this ... you don't want to mess with it.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER Did you hear about Martin?
JERRY Yeah, I heard.
KRAMER I can't believe he's in a coma.
KRAMER He's got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?
JERRY Who told you about Martin?
KRAMER Newman! He's good friends with him. Jx; Oh, big mouth Newman. I should have guessed.
KRAMER He's got all of my attachments, you know.
JERRY Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?
KRAMER What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?
JERRY You know I don't get that whole suicide machine. There's no tall buildings where these people live? They can't wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?
KRAMER So what's going on between you and Gina?
JERRY Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.
KRAMER Uh, uh.
JERRY So we're in the room and she's trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.
KRAMER Uh, uh, you see that's the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?
JERRY Nothing.
KRAMER Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you don't have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?
JERRY I didn't know what the coma etiquette was.
KRAMER There is no coma etiquette. You see that's the beauty of the coma, man. It doesn't matter what you do around it.
JERRY So you're saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, it's all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.
KRAMER I'd give him 24 hours to get out of it. They can't get out of it in 24 hours, it's a land rush.
JERRY So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, he's thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, there's nothing left?
KRAMER NOTHING LEFT! That's why I'm trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebody's going to grab it.
RULA Martin's spirit came to you as a warning.
ELAINE Why would he come to George?
RULA Because George has heightened extra sensory perception
._FAYGY_GET_YOUR_FINGER OUT OF YOUR NOSE.
OUT_OF_YOUR_NOSE. GEORGE
GEORGE I knew it. I always felt different.
RULA You are. Some coffee cake?
GEORGE Drakes?
RULA Yes.
GEORGE Did you buy this for me?
RULA No, why?
GEORGE Ha, because I love Drake's Coffee Cake.
RULA Maybe I did.
ELAINE Take it away.
GEORGE She hasn't eaten in two days.
RULA Who's Pauline?
GEORGE Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline.
RULA Do you think about her?
GEORGE When I hear her name mentioned.
RULA Cut these with your left hand.
GEORGE There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.
RULA I see an Audrey, but with a small nose.
GEORGE Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?
RULA Not in this life.
ELAINE Should you be smoking?
RULA Does it bother you?
ELAINE You're pregnant.
GEORGE Elaine.
RULA I smoked when I had Faisy.
RULA Ah oh.
GEORGE Ah oh? What? What Ah oh?
RULA I don't know about this trip George.
GEORGE You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What?
ELAINE It's really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.
GEORGE Elaine, she's a psychic. She knows how the kid's going to be.
GEORGE Should I not go on this trip?
RULA George, I am going to tell you something and I want you to really hear me.
ELAINE Now listen. I just don't know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.
GEORGE Elaine, what are you doing?
ELAINE It's disgusting.
RULA I DON'T BELIVE IT. I would like you both to leave.
ELAINE Oh fine, I don't like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.
RULA Get the hell out.
GEORGE A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
RULA Do you want me to call the super? He was an Israeli commando.
GEORGE If you don't say anything I will assume it's a plane crash.
RULA Get out.
GEORGE Not a plane crash. Is it a plane crash?
GINA I do not like your toothbrush. There are no bristles.
JERRY You can say what you want about me but I'll be damned if I'm going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.
GINA It is too small for someone with such a big mouth . Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a mouse?
JERRY No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.
GINA Who are these Stooges you speak of?
JERRY They're a comedy team.
GINA Tell me about them. Everything.
JERRY Well, they're three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot.
GINA You will show me The Stooges?
JERRY I will show you The Stooges.
GINA When?
JERRY Well, I don't really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know.
GINA Come, you walk me to a cab.
JERRY Well, uh, I uh, I don't want you to get upset or anything but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe it's not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here.
GINA You're still afraid. You are not a man.
JERRY Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?
GINA Are you going to walk me to a cab or not?
JERRY Yeah, all right. All right.
KRAMER You should just eat fruit.
NEWMAN I can't eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.
KRAMER ???
NEWMAN Hello Gina. Hello Jerry.
JERRY Hello Newman.
JERRY Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind of sicko would do that? He could kill me.
GEORGE People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didn't hurt me.
ELAINE Did you see that wall move?
JERRY Boy, it's a good thing we came.
GEORGE Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe there's native unrest.
ELAINE Hi, I haven't eaten in three days. I was wondering how much longer it would be until I get my X-ray.
NURSE We'll call you.
JERRY George, I want you to promise me something. If I'm ever in a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage.
GEORGE How come?
JERRY Looters.
ELAINE How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it?
JERRY She's really hungry.
KRAMER Hey.
ELAINE Kramer
KRAMER Well, Newman's upstairs visiting Martin.
GEORGE Would you buy my Cayman Island ticket?
KRAMER You're not going?
GEORGE No.
KRAMER Why not?
GEORGE The psychic said something terrible will happen.
KRAMER I dig.
KRAMER I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, she's going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, she's going to kill me. W He can't hear you, you idiot. Why don't you just buy another one.
KRAMER Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this one? W I have a carpet sweeper you can use.
KRAMER I don't want a carpet sweeper. They don't do anything. W It gets my rug clean.
KRAMER The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American public since One Hour Martinizing. W Well, you should take a look at my rug then.
KRAMER I wouldn't set foot in your house.
JERRY Hello.
NEWMAN Hello Jerry.
JERRY How's he doing?
KRAMER He looks happy to me.
NEWMAN I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.
JERRY Why wouldn't he?
NEWMAN No reason.
JERRY He'll have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
NEWMAN I'll bring him up to date.
JERRY How up to date?
NEWMAN Oh, all the way up.
JERRY And nothing could change your mind?
NEWMAN Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something you earn.
KRAMER Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands for this weekend. He's not going.
NEWMAN I don't care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that a,..
JERRY Drake's Coffee Cake
NEWMAN Wow, where did you get that?
JERRY From my house. I got a whole box of them.
NEWMAN Boy, that's the full size.
JERRY That's your big boy.
NEWMAN Can I have a bite?
JERRY I don't give out bites. I got another one. But I'm saving it for later.
NEWMAN Just one bite?
JERRY I don't think so. You know they, they're so fragile.
NEWMAN All right! All right. I won't say anything.
JERRY You swear?
NEWMAN I swear.
JERRY On your mother's life?
NEWMAN On my mother's life.
KRAMER oh oh oh oh oh
NEWMAN Oooh,
ELAINE And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, but juicy tender breasts of duck.
GEORGE ...sweetheart, no come here, ... sweetheart
RULA pew, pew, pew, pew
GEORGE how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is phenomenal.
RULA The nurse said she would be right back. They're supposed to take me into the delivery room.
GEORGE Oh, that's great. That's great. By the way I have to apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I don't even know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldn't get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off ..
RULA Oh, where's the nurse
GEORGE I don't know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why don't you get a nurse for mommy? ... Anyway I was just curious. Remember the other day you were saying something about my trip.
RULA Don't take that trip.
GEORGE Yeah, why? Why?
RULA EEEY, beegit, beegit beegit.
DX All right, Rula, it's time to go.
GEORGE Because? Because?
ELAINE Assassins! How dare they keep a person waiting like this! ... Drake's Coffee Cake? ... Give me that.
NEWMAN Jerry, you better stop her or I'll tell.
JERRY Elaine! No! No!
MARTIN Ooooh, ahhhh,
GEORGE Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
NEWMAN He did it right in this bed, Martin. Right in front of you.
KRAMER I want my vacuum cleaner!
JERRY Hey!
NEWMAN It was disgusting.
JERRY What are you doing? We're going out to dinner in ten minutes.
GEORGE I never assisted in a birth before. It's really quite disgusting.
JERRY What did she name the kid?
GEORGE You wouldn't believe it. Rasputin.
KRAMER Heey!
GEORGE Hey.
JERRY Hey.
GEORGE when did you get back?
KRAMER A couple of hours ago.
GEORGE So how was it?
KRAMER George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days I ever spent in my life.
JERRY osh.
KRAMER They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right in the hotel pool.
JERRY Woah.
KRAMER Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down there.
JERRY Wow!
KRAMER I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson
JERRY Oh!
KRAMER We played Backgammon in the nude.
JERRY Oh!
KRAMER She's a sweet kid.
JERRY Nude backgammon with swimsuit models!
KRAMER Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. That's probably what Rula was trying to warn you about.
GEORGE Yeah, you gotta' watch for the jellyfish.
KRAMER Yeah.
KRAMER What's this?
JERRY Oh, it's an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina.
KRAMER They moved in together?
JERRY Yeah, it's some place down in the village.
KRAMER Phew.
JERRY Yeah.
ELAINE It's Elaine.
JERRY All right we're coming down.
KRAMER Hey, where ya' going?
JERRY We're taking Elaine to dinner. She's got to start the fast again. Um, you want to go?
KRAMER Um, I'd like to but a bunch of us from the islands, we'll be getting together.
GEORGE Elle McPherson going to be there?
KRAMER OH! I got to call her back.
GEORGE When are they gonna have the flying cars, already?
JERRY Yeah, they have been promising that for a while..
GEORGE Years. When we were kids, they made it seem like it was right around the corner.
JERRY I think Ed Begley Jr. has one.
GEORGE No. That's just electric.
JERRY What about Harrison Ford? He had one in, uh, Blade Runner. That was a cool one.
GEORGE What's the competition, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?
JERRY Well, what do you think the big holdup is?
GEORGE The government is very touchy about us being in the air. Let us run around on the ground as much as we want. Anything in the air is a big production.
JERRY Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities?
GEORGE And the underwater bubble cities?
JERRY It's like we're living in the '50s here.
KRAMER It's good suspension!
JERRY Would you stop it? You'll have plenty of time to destroy it after I get it. Hey, George, I'm buyin' this car.
GEORGE What is wrong with you? You never tell 'em you like the car. You're not sure what you want. You don't even know why you're here.
JERRY There's that vein again.
GEORGE I'm starving. We should have had lunch first..
JERRY It'll be twenty minutes. I told ya, Puddy's getting me an insider deal.
GEORGE Since when is Elaine's boyfriend selling cars? I thought he was a mechanic.
JERRY I guess he graduated.
GEORGE That's an easy move: go from screwin' you behind your back to screwin' you right to your face.
JERRY Thank you.
GEORGE Puddy's just gonna give you the car, huh? You'll see. First they stick you with the undercoating, rust-proofing, dealer prep. Sudeenly, you're on your back like a turnip.
JERRY Alright. Calm down.
GEORGE My father had a car salesman buddy. He was gonna fix him up real nice. Next thing I know, I'm gettin' dropped of in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof. All the kids are shoutin' at me, "Hey, Le George! Bonjour, Le George! Let's stuff Le George in Le Locker!"
KRAMER Jerry, I don't think this thing is hooked up right.
JERRY Alright, we're goin' in.
SALESMAN You've got a good eye, there. I see you've noticed the uni-body construction. I'm Rick. Are you looking to buy or lease?
KRAMER Uh, borrow. It's for my friend. Yeah, he'll be buying..
RICK Maybe I should talk to him.
KRAMER Oh, I don't think so. No, he's an entertainer. You know, all over the place. That's where I come in.
RICK I see. So, you're his manag-
KRAMER Yeah, neighbor. That's right. Yeah, why don't we take this boiler out for a shakedown?
GEORGE Look at these salesmen. The only thing these guys fear is the walk-out. No matter what they say, you say, "I'll walk out of here right now!"
SALESMAN Can I help you with something?
GEORGE Hold it! One more step and we're walkin'!
JERRY George. Sorry, we're just waiting for David Puddy.
GEORGE He is. You don't know what I'm doin' here.
ELAINE Hey.
JERRY Hey.
PUDDY Sorry I'm late.
ELAINE My new salesman boyfriend took me out to celebrate his promotion.
JERRY Ah. Where'd you go?
ELAINE Uh, to a restaurant.
PUDDY Arby's.
ELAINE I had the roast beef..
JERRY So, Puddy, I decided I'm gonna go with another 900 convertible.
PUDDY Alright. Classic. High-five.
ELAINE David, can you tell me where the Xerox machine is?
PUDDY Oh, sure, babe. Salesman-only copy room right there.
ELAINE Oh.
PUDDY Hey, come on, guys. I'll show you the 900.
GEORGE Yeah, you show us the 900.
RICK .. And look at these features, Mr. Kramer: Anti-lock breaks, automatic climate control. Uh, make a right at this corner, please. Adjustable steering wheel, and.. Oh, Mr. Kramer, you missed the turn..
KRAMER No. No, I didn't.
RICK Well, that's okay. We'll make this next right, and swing around to get back to the dealership.
KRAMER Well, it's a test drive, right? I never drive around here. If I'm gonna recommend this car, I need to see that it'll handle my daily routine.
RICK So where are we going?
KRAMER Just a little place I like to call, "You'll see". Puddy's office
GEORGE I'm starving. You got any of those free donuts you use to soften people up?
PUDDY By the service department.
GEORGE Alright, remember: no rust-proofing. Commit to nothing. If you have to speak - mumble.
JERRY Au revoir, Le George.
GEORGE Don't think it can't happen!
JERRY So, Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? No more "grease monkey".
PUDDY I don't care for that term.
JERRY Oh. Sorry, I didn't know..
PUDDY No, I don't know too many monkeys who could take apart a fuel injector.
JERRY I saw one once that could do sign language.
PUDDY Yeah, I saw that one. Uh.. Koko.
JERRY Yeah, Koko.
PUDDY Right, Koko. That chimp's alright. High-five.
GEORGE Hey, hey, hey! What's goin' on here? You didn't agree to anything, did ya?
JERRY No. We both just saw the same monkey.
GEORGE Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were none left.
PUDDY Well, there's a vending machine. I could show you where it is.
GEORGE Hey, gimme a dollar.
JERRY Where's your money?
GEORGE I'm here helpin' you.
ELAINE Hey. Where's Puddy? The copy machine is broken.
GEORGE Heh, heh, heh. That's what they want you to think.
JERRY Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed an annoying little habit?
ELAINE The squinting?
JERRY No.
ELAINE The staring?
JERRY No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five.
ELAINE I thought all guys do that.
JERRY Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual. In fact, even some of them have moved on - they're using sign language now.
ELAINE Is that bad?
JERRY What do you think the Nazis were doin'? That was the heil-five.
ELAINE Isn't that from your act, like, ten years ago?
JERRY It was a good bit in the 80's, and it's still relatable today.
PUDDY Good news. We got a 900 in black. That's the hot color. High-five.
ELAINE Um, David, you know what? Can you come help me fix the copy machine?
PUDDY You owe me five. Dealership back room
GEORGE Twix.. B-5.
GEORGE Ah, come on!
GEORGE Ah, excuse me. Do you have change of a dollar?
MECHANIC No.
GEORGE Could I, uh, could I trade you for another dollar?
MECHANIC Don't have one.
GEORGE Excuse me. When your, uh, when your wallet was open, I glanced inside, and I couldn't help but notice that you had several crisp dollar bills.
MECHANIC You're incorrect.
GEORGE Perhaps you could look again, please? I'm very hungry.
MECHANIC We had donuts earlier.
GEORGE I guess everyone here enjoys giving the old screwgie, huh?! You're all doin' a hell of a job! Ho, ho. What I would do with you.. Dealership car
RICK Mr. Kramer, we're really not allowed to use the cars to run errands.
KRAMER No, look, Rick. I'm very close to giving this car, that my celebrity friend is considering, my full endorsement. Oooh, Let's see if I can get a smile from these femininas.. Hey, Ladies! It's the Saab 900! What do you think? Can I interest you in a little supplemental restraint?! Geeze.. Dealership back room
JERRY I think the candy comes out over there.
GEORGE People can drop change down here, Jerry. And they're too lazy to pick it up.
JERRY Either that, or they've got a little hang-up about lying face-down in filth. Why don't you just go to the cashier?
GEORGE The cashier is at lunch - which is where I'd like to be.
JERRY How much was under there?
GEORGE I think somethin' bit me. I just need another nickel.
JERRY Hey, Puddy thinks I should go for the CD player. What do you think?
GEORGE Ho, ho, ho! He's got a live one. He's just reeling his big fish in!
JERRY Hey, can I have my dollar back?
GEORGE It's wrinkled. It's worthless.
GEORGE Ha, ha, ha, ha! Come on! Jump!
MAN They just put out some more donuts.
GEORGE They did?
MAN Last one. Dealership car
KRAMER Well, just one more errand and we can head back.
RICK Actually, it looks like we're gonna need some gas.
KRAMER Oh? Well, how much gas do you think is in there right now?
RICK Well, it's on "E".
KRAMER You know, uh, oftentimes, Jerry - he lend me his car and I find myself in a situation where the car is almost out of gas. But, for a variety of reasons, I don't want to be the one responsible for purchasing costly gasoline.
RICK So, you want to know how far you can drive your friend's car for free.
KRAMER Well, I make it up to him in other ways. Dealership back room
GEORGE As you will see, the candy bar is paid for, and yet, remains dangling in the machine. Hey, it's gone. Where is my Twix? What?! That guy's eatin' it!
SALESMAN Well, how do you know that one's yours?
GEORGE Uh, it was dangling! There were only two left in the machine! He must've bought one, and gotten both.
SALESMAN Sir, are you gonna buy a car?
GEORGE No! Hey! Hey! I can see you! That is my Twix! Oh, ha, ha! Ho, ho!
PUDDY Paper jam.. Got it! High-five. On the flip side.
ELAINE David, um, I..
PUDDY Don't leave me hangin'
ELAINE You're a salesman now - and the high-five is.. it's very grease monkey.
PUDDY What did I tell you about that?
ELAINE I'm sorry, but the high-five is just so stupid.
PUDDY Oh yeah? I'll tell you what's stupid. You. Stupid.
ELAINE Well, that is really mature.
PUDDY Yeah? So are you.
ELAINE Huh?
PUDDY You're the grease monkey.
ELAINE Uh.. that doesn't make any sense. I am leaving.
PUDDY Yeah, if you leave, we're through.
ELAINE Fine! We're through!
PUDDY Oh, so you're leaving?
ELAINE That's right. High-five! On the flip side! Takin' me to Arby's..
JERRY Hey! Wh-where are you..?
PUDDY Let's finish this up.
JERRY Did you two break up?
PUDDY That chick's whacked. We're history. I just left out a couple of things: rust-proofing..
JERRY "Rust-proofing"?
PUDDY Transport charge, storage surcharge, additional overcharge, finder's fee
JERRY "Finder's fee"? It was on the lot!
PUDDY Yeah, that's right. Floor mats, keys..
JERRY Keys?
PUDDY How ya gonna start it? Dealership's shop
GEORGE Excuse me. I believe you just ate my Twix bar. It was dangling. And when you purchased your Twix bar, you got a little freebie, and you never bothered to ask why, or seek out its rightful owner.
MECHANIC First of all, it wasn't a Twix. It was a 5th Avenue bar.
GEORGE Huh. You must think I'm pretty stupid. That was no 5th Avenue bar. I can see the crumb right there in the corner of your lip! Now, that-that-that is a cookie - and we all know Twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch.
MECHANIC Yeah, it's just a little nougat.
GEORGE Nougat? Please. I think I've reached the point in my life where I can tell between nougat and cookie. So, let's not just say things that are obvious fabrications.
MECHANIC You know, you're gettin' a little vein there..
GEORGE I know about the vein! I can't believe this guy..
JERRY Hey, George!
GEORGE Hey, starving!
JERRY No, last one. Listen, you gotta help me out. Elaine and Puddy just broke up, he's treatin' me just like a regular customer, now!
GEORGE I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't listen. No, ho, ho! You were gonna get a deal, huh? There's now laws in this place. Anything goes! It's Thunderdome!
SALESWOMAN Is someone helping you?
GEORGE Stay back! Dealership car
RICK Where is it now?
KRAMER There's still some overlap between the needle and the slash below the "E".
RICK How long are you gonna go?
KRAMER Oh, I've been in the slash many times. This is nothing. You'll get used to it. Just, get it out of your mind.
RICK Have you ever been completely below the slash?
KRAMER Well, I almost did once, and I blacked out. When I came to, the car was in a ditch, and the tank was full. I don't know who did it, and I never got to thank them..
RICK Mr. Kramer, the road!
KRAMER Whoop! Whoop! Puddy's office
JERRY So, listen, Puddy. When we first started this deal, I thought things were gonna be different. Now, if you want to play hard ball, I got my friend, George, here, and he can play pretty hard.. ball. George, vein it up.
GEORGE Alright, Puddy, listen, and listen good: I need to know the name of that mechanic that walks around here. Big guy, a liar. Short name. Sam? Moe? Sol?!
JERRY George! Can we focus on the car, here?
GEORGE I'm starving! I can feel my stomach sucking up against my spine.
PUDDY Jerry, I just need your signature, here, and we'll get you that yellow car ready to go.
JERRY Yellow? I wanted black.
PUDDY I can't give you black at that price.
JERRY George, could you help me, please?
GEORGE Yes. This is wrong!
JERRY Sing it, sister!
GEORGE Just because a candy bar fails to fall from its perch..!
JERRY Uhhh..
GEORGE ..does not imply transfer of ownership. Moe, Sol, or... Lem is not gonna get away with this!
JERRY I'll be right back.
PUDDY Okay.
JERRY Hey, George! Dealership car
RICK Is it just the angle I'm looking from?
KRAMER No, Sir. We are down there.
RICK Oh, this is amazing! Oh, I've never felt so alive!
KRAMER Yeah, well, alright. I'm satisfied. We better get some gas.
RICK What? Well, we can't stop now.
KRAMER What do you mean?
RICK We have to keep going - all the way back to the dealership. That was the plan.
KRAMER There was no plan.
RICK Well, let's make it the plan! Let's just.. go for it! Like Thelma and Louise.
KRAMER What, they drove to a dealership?
RICK No, they drove off a cliff.
KRAMER You are one sick mama.. I like it.
RICK Mr. Kramer, the road!
KRAMER Yup! Yup! Elaine's apartment
ELAINE Hello?
JERRY Elaine, you've got to get back down to the dealer. Puddy is screwin' me on this car, which is yellow now!
ELAINE Who is this?
JERRY Elaine!
ELAINE What?!
JERRY You gotta get back together with Puddy so I can make this deal.
ELAINE You know, just that you cared enough to call means so much, Jerry.
JERRY You're gonna get back together, anyway. It's thousands of dollars!
ELAINE Oh, I don't know..
JERRY Come on. Then you don't have to see him again til my 15,000-mile check.
ELAINE Well, will you pay my cab fare out there?
JERRY Fine.
ELAINE And I didn't like that roast beef, so how bout some lunch?
JERRY No. No lunch.
ELAINE I'll hang the phone up right now!
JERRY Alright! Lunch!
ELAINE I'll see ya.
JERRY Bye.
JERRY Everybody's ripping me off!
GEORGE I'd like to report a problem with one of your mechanics.
WILLIE When did you bring the car in?
GEORGE Yeah right.. I'm gonna get my car repaired at a dealership. Huh! Why don't I just flush my money down the toilet?
WILLIE Sir, what, exactly, is the problem?
GEORGE One of your guys - Kip, or Ned, short name - stole my Twix candy bar!
WILLIE Are you saying he grabbed the candy bar away from you?
GEORGE He might as well have! I caught him, and his face was covered in chocolate and cookie crumbs.
WILLIE I thought you said it was a Twix.
GEORGE Oh, it was. But he claimed it was a 5th Avenue bar.
WILLIE Maybe it was.
GEORGE Oh, no, no. Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch.
WILLIE What about the $100,000 bar?
GEORGE No. Rice and caramel.
WILLIE Nougat?
GEORGE No.
WILLIE Positive?
GEORGE Please.
WOMAN You know they changed the name from $100,000 bar to 100 Grand?
GEORGE All I want is my seventy-five cents back, an apology, and for him to be fired!
WILLIE_SR I remember when you used to be able to get a Hershey for a nickel.
MAN What's the one with the swirling chocolate in the commercial?
GEORGE They all have swirling chocolate in the commercial!
WILLIE_SR Not Skittles.
WILLIE Dad, I told you you could sit here only if you don't talk.
WOMAN You make your father sit here all day?
WILLIE He likes it!
GEORGE Alright! Do you mind? I have the window! Now, what are you gonna do about my Twix?
MAN Twix has too much coconut.
GEORGE No! There's no coconut!
WOMAN I'm allergic to coconut.
WILLIE I'm not.
WILLIE_SR ..A nickel! Dealership office showroom
ELAINE Cab receipt. Hey, Puddy.
PUDDY I'm with a customer.
ELAINE Uh..
JERRY No, no. No, Elaine, the car can wait. What's important is you two getting back together. Eh, then we'll talk about the car.
PUDDY I don't want to get back with her. She's too bossy.
ELAINE David..
JERRY Okay. Now, I know this is an important decision. Why don't we all just sit down and talk about it? Come on, come on. Now, look, you both find each other attractive, right?
ELAINE_AND_PUDDY Right.
JERRY Clearly, no one else can stand to be with either one of you..
ELAINE I guess.
PUDDY Good point.
JERRY Alright. Now, what do I have to do to put you two in a relationship today? Gas station
KRAMER Cars can go on empty, but not us humans, huh, fella? I'll get us a couple of Twix bars.
RICK No, no coconut for me.
KRAMER Alright, I'll get ya a Mounds bar. Keep the engine running.
RICK Ahh!
KRAMER No, man! Not the gas!
RICK But it needs it, Kramer! It needs it bad!
KRAMER Do you think that this'll make you happy? Cause it won't!
RICK Ah, you can just go on without me.
KRAMER Listen to me. When that car rolls into that dealership, and that tank is bone dry, I want you to be there with me when everyone says, "Kramer and that other guy, oh, they went further to the left of the slash than anyone ever dreamed!"
RICK Maybe we better get moving.
KRAMER It's good to have you back, Stan.
RICK It's Rick, by the way.
KRAMER No time! Dealership's customer service room
WILLIE Mr. Costanza, I really don't have time for this.
GEORGE Now, if this mechanic guy, was, in fact, eating a 5th Avenue bar, as he claimed, wouldn't you agree he would have no problem picking one out from a candy line-up?
WILLIE "Candy line-up"?
GEORGE I've spent the last hour preparing ten candy bars with no wrappers of identification of any kind for him to select from.
WILLIE It took you an hour?
GEORGE Only I hold the answer key to their true candy identities. And so, without further ado, I give you.. the candy line-up.
SALESWOMAN Hey, Willie, check it out! Free candy!
GEORGE That's my candy line-up! Where are all my cards?! They're - they're all on the floor!
GEORGE And you! How many Twix does that make for you, today?! Like, 8 Twix?!
MECHANIC No.
MAN Hey, this Clark bar is good.
GEORGE It's a Twix! They're all Twix! It was a setup! A setup, I tell ya! And you've robbed it! You've all screwed me again! Now, gimme one! Gimme a Twix!
MECHANIC They're all gone.
GEORGE Ttttttwwwwiiiiiixxxxx!
ELAINE What was that?
PUDDY There's a mental hospital right near here.
JERRY Alright. Elaine, David, I believe we have a deal here in principle: Arby's - no more than once a month. In exchange, Elaine comes to your softball game, and doesn't read a book.
ELAINE Yeah, well, that's not bad.
PUDDY I can live with that.
JERRY So, you're back together?
PUDDY Yeah.
JERRY Alright, alright. Alright, that's enough! Let's get back to my deal. That undercoating, that's just a rip-off, isn't it, David?
PUDDY Oh, we don't even know what it is.
JERRY So, I'm gettin' the insider's deal?
PUDDY Insider's deal. High-five. Dealership car
RICK There's the dealer!
KRAMER Hey!
RICK We did! We pulled it off! I can't believe it! Where's the needle?
KRAMER Oh, it broke off, baby! Woo, hoo, hoo!
RICK Oh, Mr. Kramer, I gotta thank you. I - I learned a lot. Things are gonna be different for me now.
KRAMER Well, that's a weird thing to say..
RICK I wonder how much longer we could have lasted.
KRAMER Yeah, yeah. I wonder.. hmm. NYC Cab
ELAINE This is nice. What kind of car is this?
CABBIE Caprice Classic.
ELAINE You couldn't just give him one high-five?
JERRY And where does it end? Then, everyone's doin' it. It's like the wave at ball games. Air quotes. The phrase, "Don't go there." - Someone's gotta take a stand!
GEORGE This Arby's is good.
ELAINE So, George, I still don't understand - how was that a setup?
JERRY And who were you tryin' to set up, anyway? The mechanic or the manager?
GEORGE I don't know. All of em. They're all crooks! Besides, I couldn't get all different candy bars, anyway.
GEORGE What was that?
JERRY I think there's a mental hospital near here.
ELAINE Very near.
KRAMER Whew! Well, I think we stopped.
RICK You - you can probably let go of my hand now.
KRAMER Oh, yeah. Well, I'll think about it..
RICK Do you have my card?
JERRY Can you give me an explanation as to why the pharmacist has to be two-and-a-half feet up above everybody else? What the hell is he doing, he can't be down there on the floor with you and me? Brain surgeons, airline pilots, nuclear physicists, we're all on the same level. Oh no, he's gotta be two-and-a-half feet up. "Look out, everybody, I'm working with pills. Spread out, give me some room." The only hard part of his whole job that I could see is typing everything onto that little tiny label. He has to try and get all the words on there, keep the paper in the- it's a little piece of paper, in the roller of the typewriter. Oh no, he's gotta be two-and-a-half feet up. "Yeah, I'd like to get this prescription filled." "Alright, and you wait down there, only I'm allowed up here."
GEORGE Where'd you meet her?
JERRY I met her on an elevator.
GEORGE On an elevator? You met a woman on an elevator?
JERRY Impossible, right?
GEORGE You got less than sixty seconds. That's like dismantling a time bomb. What got into you?
JERRY I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex. The words just came out of my mouth.
GEORGE Wow. What'd you say?
JERRY You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England.
GEORGE Wow.
JERRY Can you believe I did that?
GEORGE What did she say?
ISABEL What crop circles?
JERRY Not a good sign.
GEORGE Not everybody knows what the crop circles are. Do you know what the crop circles are?
NEWSSTAND_OWNER Crop circles? Why don't you buy something?
JERRY You got something in your teeth there.
GEORGE What?
JERRY It's green.
GEORGE Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all afternoon.
JERRY Did you bump into anybody you knew?
GEORGE I had a job interview.
JERRY How'd it go?
GEORGE Take a guess.
INTERVIEWER Well, Mr. Costanza, we have nothing available at the present time, but should anything open up, we'll be in touch.
GEORGE Ok, thanks.
JERRY What do you need a job, you got Audrey.
GEORGE Yeah, right.
JERRY What's the matter?
GEORGE Oh, nothing.
JERRY What?
GEORGE You won't think I'm a bad person?
JERRY Too late for that.
GEORGE 'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a psychiatrist, maybe. Well, her nose is a little big.
JERRY Yeah, she's got a big nose.
GEORGE I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big.
JERRY It's a schnoz.
GEORGE Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little short of perfection.
JERRY A little.
GEORGE So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should be grateful someone like her even looks at me. I have no job, nothing. But I have to say, I think about the nose. I don't want to think about the nose. I don't ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed at night, I tell myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it. I look at her, I see nose.
JERRY Stop being so concerned with looks.
JERRY Have you said anything to her about it?
GEORGE I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, I know that. And I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose.
JERRY Alright, shut up, here they come.
GEORGE How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing.
KRAMER So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house so, you know, she gives it to me. Well, two years later he shows up and he takes it back. And now he's in prison. He got arrested for mail fraud. So Elaine, all you have to do is go over to the apartment, tell the landlord that you're his daughter and you want to bring him the jacket in prison.
ELAINE Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?
KRAMER No no, he's never met her. She's in California.
ELAINE Are you coming with me?
KRAMER Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fiance, Peter Von Nostrand.
GEORGE Why don't you just commit yourself already?
AUDREY What is so special about this jacket?
ELAINE He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women.
AUDREY What's the smudge on your hand?
KRAMER Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm going back there tonight, you know, I'm not gonna pay another cover charge.
GEORGE What, you didn't wash all day?
KRAMER Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women at this club. Ohh, man.
AUDREY It's amazing how many beautiful women live in New York. I actually find it kind of intimidating.
KRAMER Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.
ELAINE Kramer!
KRAMER What? What?
ELAINE How could you say something like that?!
KRAMER What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job.
ELAINE No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey.
AUDREY No, it's ok.
ELAINE What did you have to say that for?
KRAMER Well, I was just trying to help out.
ELAINE Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin.
KRAMER You see what happens when you try to be nice?
JERRY But what would the world be like if people said whatever they were thinking, all the time, whenever it came to them? How long would a blind date last? About thirteen seconds, I think. "Oh, sorry. Your rear end is too big." "That's ok, your breath stinks anyway. See you later, no problem, good-bye, ok, thank you very much."
AUDREY Elaine said I could stay with her another month until Tina gets back. What are you thinking about?
GEORGE Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking?
AUDREY You look like you've got something on your mind.
GEORGE Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind. So how about that Kramer, huh?
AUDREY How about him?
GEORGE They way he just says stuff.
AUDREY He sure does.
GEORGE Yeah. Yeah, he's quite a character.
AUDREY So, what did you think?
GEORGE About the pizza?
AUDREY No, about the nose job.
GEORGE Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?
AUDREY Well, I've thought about it, but I don't know.
GEORGE Yeah. Not that I care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined. And again, I'm not suggesting.
AUDREY I know, they're good.
GEORGE Peter Jennings had one.
AUDREY Really?
GEORGE Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so...
AUDREY Uh huh.
GEORGE It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.
AUDREY I hate the dentist.
GEORGE It's a cleaning.
AUDREY So you really think I should do this?
GEORGE If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you this. Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society. I don't condone it, but it's a fact of life.
AUDREY Well, maybe I should.
GEORGE What the hell.
ELAINE Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?
GEORGE Me? I didn't say anything.
ELAINE You encouraged her to get one.
GEORGE I didn't encourage. No encourage.
ELAINE Peter Jennings had one?
GEORGE It's possible.
ELAINE Well, I think you should accept her for who she is.
AUDREY No, George is right. I want to get one.
ELAINE I think it's a mistake.
GEORGE Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one.
GEORGE I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it.
JERRY Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes.
GEORGE Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the bandages off at four o'clock.
JERRY We have time.
GEORGE It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face.
JERRY It is exciting.
GEORGE Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but...
JERRY Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. It's like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win.
GEORGE You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.
JERRY Then what?
GEORGE He still wins but it's not a blowout.
JERRY She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless, I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day.
JERRY I don't want to see this woman anymore but I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help me.
KRAMER I'm proud of you.
JERRY So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey.
GEORGE Good for you.
JERRY I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was just completely uninhibited.
GEORGE It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring.
JERRY It's not like that at all.
ELAINE How do you even know the jacket is there?
KRAMER Well I don't, I'm guessing.
GEORGE Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? Now that you're gonna be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began. You know, like if you'd listened to your friend, Elaine,
AUDREY George?
GEORGE Yeah?
AUDREY Enough.
JERRY Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road.
ELAINE Are you sure you want us here for this?
AUDREY Yes.
JERRY Shouldn't a doctor do it?
AUDREY No, he said I could do it. Okay, here goes.
GEORGE Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth.
ELAINE It looks good.
JERRY Great job.
KRAMER You got butchered.
JERRY Let's put him over here.
KRAMER Where are you going?
AUDREY To the doctor!
KRAMER Wait, wait, wait, I'll go with you.
ELAINE How ya feeling?
GEORGE Too much salt in my diet.
ELAINE Can I get you anything?
GEORGE Nah, I'm good.
ELAINE You sure? Anything?
GEORGE Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?
ELAINE No, it didn't. No, it didn't.
GEORGE It's like, all dented.
ELAINE Seems to be.
GEORGE Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be stopped, no way, no how, science just marches--
ELAINE Shut up, George.
GEORGE Shut up?
ELAINE Yeah.
GEORGE Interesting.
JERRY Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!
KRAMER I don't have it, I threw it out.
JERRY You're lying! You got it, I want that number!
KRAMER I told you, I threw it out.
JERRY Give it to me!
KRAMER You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise.
JERRY Well, I changed my mind, I want that number.
KRAMER You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number.
JERRY I was lying, give it to me!
KRAMER No, you told me not to!
JERRY I want that number!
KRAMER Alright! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
AUDREY The doctor said that they need to build the lateral wall of the septum. Over here...
GEORGE Yeah.
AUDREY You see this perinasal sinus cavity?
GEORGE Oh, I got it.
AUDREY You see how it's collapsing? That's what's causing this huge dent.
GEORGE Yeah, phew.
AUDREY So anyway, George, do you know what I was thinking about?
GEORGE What?
AUDREY Remember we talked about taking a trip together?
GEORGE We did?
AUDREY Yeah, we talked about going to Hawaii?
GEORGE Hawaii?
AUDREY Anyway, I think it would be great to get away after all this. George You know, Hawaii could be a little tricky right now, there's a lot of high pressure winds down there this time of year, there's a lot of debris constantly flying around. Wood, and uh, lava, pretty dangerous.
AUDREY I never heard that.
GEORGE Oh yeah. My friend lived there.
AUDREY We could go to the Caribbean.
GEORGE You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on a plane right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them to me, he used to be a pilot, so. Big investigation in the, uh, what's the word there, uh, offing. It's in the offing. But, you know, you shouldn't let that stop you from going. You could go. I don't mind.
AUDREY George, I don't think this is working.
ISABEL Ever since you came back from the Army, you've changed. I swear Nelson, I don't even know who you are anymore.
JERRY I'm Nelson!
ISABEL That's not the line, Jerry.
JERRY Alright, alright, I'm sorry. Nothing's changed, Alma, I just need more time.
ISABEL I swear, Nelson, sometimes at night, when you're not around, I just go crazy thinking about you.
JERRY Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun.
ISABEL Yeah, bowling's good if you're really gross and ugly.
JERRY Uh oh. My organs are playing chess again.
JERRY'S_BRAIN Well I'm getting a little tired of this. What do you say we play one for all the marbles?
JERRY'S_PENIS Oh Brain, what are you doing? You cannot beat me. Do you have any idea who you're dealing with? Forget about it!
JERRY'S_BRAIN I can't take her anymore. I hate reading her stupid little acting scenes.
JERRY'S_PENIS Oh, so what? So you read from a little play. You can't put up with that for an hour to make me happy? You're so selfish. Give me one hour, then I will take over, you will not have to think for the rest of the night.
JERRY'S_BRAIN What about tomorrow morning? Do you have any idea what that's like for me? Do you care? No, you don't care. So long as you get to do whatever it is you do. You disgust me.
JERRY'S_PENIS Oh, go read a book.
JERRY'S_BRAIN Enough chatting, let's play.
ELAINE You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey to the hospital.
KRAMER Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got everything?
ELAINE Yeah.
KRAMER Wait wait wait wait wait. Here.
ELAINE What do I need this for?
KRAMER Because we're engaged.
ELAINE We're engaged?
KRAMER Um hm.
ELAINE Kramer, this is too big.
KRAMER It's my mom's.
LANDLORD Hello?
ELAINE Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My father asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him.
LANDLORD Oh, hello Miss Pepper, it's a pleasure to meet you. And you must be Professor Von Nostrand?
KRAMER Yes, yes I am.
LANDLORD I've read your book, Professor, and I was quite intrigued by it.
KRAMER Uh, yes. Well, it's, uh, very intriguing.
LANDLORD Tell me, is it your contention that Shakespeare was an imposter?
KRAMER My contention?
LANDLORD Yes, your contention.
KRAMER Yes, that's my contention.
ELAINE I heard him contend that.
LANDLORD It's too bad about your father.
ELAINE Oh, it was a frame-up.
LANDLORD A fine man, he spoke often of you. He's very proud of the work you're doing.
ELAINE Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing.
KRAMER She does fine work.
LANDLORD Your father gave me strict orders not to turn the jacket over to anyone, but I suppose I can make an exception in your case. The closet's this way.
ELAINE How kind of you.
LANDLORD You know, your father has a very extensive wardrobe.
JERRY'S_BRAIN What's the matter, fella? You look a little tired. Ha ha ha ha ha!
ISABEL Nelson, don't you see? You are a part of me, and I, I am a part of you.
JERRY'S_PENIS It's killing me.
JERRY'S_BRAIN That's your move?
JERRY'S_PENIS Yeah.
JERRY'S_BRAIN Well that's trouble, my friend. That's big trouble. Checkmate!
JERRY'S_PENIS Getting weak... Losing power... You haven't seen the last of me. I'll be back. You're nothing without me. Nothing!
JERRY'S_BRAIN Punk.
JERRY Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working.
ELAINE Daddy certainly does have an extensive wardrobe.
LANDLORD He is a fine dresser and I'm sure I don't have to tell you he's quite popular with the ladies.
ELAINE My father, really? I had no idea.
LANDLORD Yes, they're crazy about him. There was one in particular, came around about two years ago, looked a lot like you, Professor. Could have been your mother. What was her name again? Carter? Kramer! That's it, Babs Kramer. Nasty woman, many a night I had to throw her out on the street, drunken stumblebum.
KRAMER You don't say?
ELAINE I found it!
LANDLORD The woman used to walk around here half naked, sucking Colt 45 from a can. Her big fat stomach hanging out, orthopedic hose up to her knees, screaming down the hall, "Come back to bed, Albert, you big hairy ape, and bring back that box of Danish!"
KRAMER So I grabbed the guy by the collar.
ELAINE Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!"
JERRY So I assume the jig was up.
ELAINE Yeah, pretty much.
AUDREY Hi.
ELAINE Hi!
JERRY Hey.
AUDREY Hello.
GEORGE Audrey? My god, you look incredible! I can't believe it!
AUDREY Well, it was his doctor. He was wonderful.
ELAINE So, will I see you later tonight?
AUDREY Not sure.
KRAMER Well, I'll check you guys out later. Ready?
AUDREY I didn't wash.
KRAMER Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.
ELAINE Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect proportion with the rest of her face. She's breathtaking! Who would have though she's like--
GEORGE Elaine. Shut up.
JERRY The technical term for a nose job is rhinoplasty. Rhino, okay? Do we really need to insult the person at this particular moment of their lives? They know they have a big nose, that's why they're coming in. Do they really need the abuse of being compared to a rhinoceros on top of everything else? When someone goes in for a hair transplant, they don't go, "We're going to perform a cue-ballectomy on you, Mr. Johnson. We're going to attempt to remove the skinheadia of your chrome-domus which is the technical term."
MRS._SOKOL Just sign here please.
GEORGE I know who it was too. It was the guy who interviewed me. He was very threatened by me. Why else wouldn't he hire me? I could sell latex like that .
MRS._SOKOL Sign that.
GEORGE Who is this?
MRS._SOKOL It's my daughta'
GEORGE THIS is your daughter? My God! My God! I I hope you don't mind my saying. She is breathtaking.
MRS._SOKOL Ya' think so?
GEORGE Ah, would you take this picture away from me. Take it away and get it outta here. Let me just sign this and go.
MRS._SOKOL You know she doesn't even have a boyfriend.
GEORGE Okay, Okay. Who do you think you're talking to? What are ya'... you trying to make a joke, because it's not funny. I can tell you that.
MRS._SOKOL I'm serious.
GEORGE It's one think to not give me the extension But to tease and to torture me like this. There's no call for that.
MRS._SOKOL Would you like her phone numba'?
MRS._SOKOL Mrs. Sokol I, I don't know what to say. I, uh, where should I sign this thing?
MRS._SOKOL No no no, Don't worry about it.
ELAINE So tell me more about this game SIX.
KEITH Well, there was two outs, bottom of the tenth, we're one out away from losing the series.
ELAINE ooooh ahhh
KRAMER Koochie koochie koochie koo

KRAMER I'm not joking. She looks like Lyndon Johnson.
CAROL Jerry, I can't believe it took you so long to come see the baby. I kept saying to Michael, "When is Jerry going to see the baby?"
JERRY I was saying the same thing.

CARRIE But it's Saturday. all the offices are closed.

ELAINE Cookies?
JERRY Did he kiss you good night?
ELAINE I dunno.
JERRY What do you mean you don't know?
ELAINE All right. He kissed me. Okay?
JERRY Well, what kind of a kiss? Was it a peck? Was it a kiss? Was it a long make out thing?
ELAINE Between a peck and a make out.
JERRY So, you like him.
ELAINE I don't understand. Before you were jealous of me. Now you're jealous of him?
JERRY Ah, I'm jealous of everybody.
JERRY hello. Oh, hi. What's happening? ... what? oh um, sure, ... um, yeah, okay, uh. I'll see you then. Yeah, yeah, Bye.
ELAINE Who was that?
JERRY That was Keith.
ELAINE What's going on?
JERRY He wants me to help him move.
ELAINE Help him move? Move what?
JERRY You know, furniture.
ELAINE So, what did you say?
JERRY I said yes, but I don't feel right about it. I mean I hardly know the guy. That's a big step oin a relationship. The biggest. That's like going all the way.
ELAINE And you feel you're not really ready for,...
JERRY Well we went out one time. Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong?
KRAMER What's going on?
JERRY Keith Hernandez just asked me to help him move.
KRAMER What? Well, you hardly know the guy.... What a nerve. You see wasn't I right about this guy? Didn't I tell you? Now, you're not going to do it are you?
JERRY ... I said yes.
KRAMER You said yes? Don't you have any pride or self respect? I mean, how can you prostitute yourself like this? I mean what are you going to do? You're going to start driving him to the airport?
JERRY I'm not driving him to the airport!
KRAMER yeah yeah
JERRY hey Kramer do me a favour .
KRAMER What?
JERRY Don't mention it to anybody.
KRAMER I wish you never mentioned it to ME.

CARRIE It's over buddy. Done. Finished. So long. Good bye. Adios. Sayanara.
GEORGE Why?
CARRIE I bin thinkin about it. You got no job. You got no prospects. You're like Biff Loman.
GEORGE I went to the hardware store interview.
CARRIE You think I'm going to spend my life with somebody because he can get me a deal on a box of nails?
GEORGE I thought were a team.
CARRIE If I ever need a drill bit I'll call you.
GEORGE Carrie, could you do me a favour? Could you not mention this to your mother?
KEITH Ya know I hate to brag but, uh, I did win eleven straight golden gloves.
ELAINE 
KEITH I wouldn't have brought it up but since you mentioned it.
ELAINE Ha, I didn't mention it.
KEITH Well I won them anyway.
ELAINE Well so what. I mean you played first base. I mean they always put the worst player on first base. That's were they put me and I stunk.
KEITH Elaine. you don't know the first thing about first base.
ELAINE ha ha well I know something about getting to first base. And I know you'll never be there.
KEITH The way I figure it I've already been there and I plan on rounding second tonight at around eleven o'clock.
ELAINE Well, uh, I'd watch the third base coach if I were you 'cause I don't think he's waving you in. You know I hate to say this but I think we're really hitting it off. Get it? Get it?
KEITH Funny.
ELAINE What are you doing?
KEITH What's that?
ELAINE You smoke?
KEITH Yeah.
ELAINE I didn't know you smoked.
KEITH Is that a problem?
ELAINE Uh, ...
JERRY She likes him I mean she really likes him.
GEORGE How do you kn ow?
JERRY Who wouldn't like him? I like him. And I'm a guy.
GEORGE I suppose he's an attractive man, I , ...
JERRY Forget that. He's a ball player. MVP 1979. I'm making wise cracks in some night club. This guy was in game six. They're a perfect match. They like go together. They're like one of these brother and sister couples that look alike.
GEORGE Hate those couples. I could never bee one of those couples. There are no bald woman around. You know?
JERRY You know I know this sounds a little arrogant but I never thought she would find anyone she would like better than me. Ya know, I guess I had my chance and that's that.
GEORGE You know what I would like to do? I would really like to have sex with a tall woman. I mean really tall. Like a like a giant Like six five.
JERRY Really?
GEORGE What was the tallest woman you ever slept with?
JERRY I don't know ... six three.
GEORGE Wow, ... god! You see this is all I think about. Sleeping with a giant. It's my life's ambition.
JERRY So I guess it's fair to say you've set different goals for yourself than say, Thomas Edison, Magellan, these types of people.
GEORGE Magellan? You like Magellan?
JERRY Oh, yeah,. My favourite explorer. Around the world. Come on.
GEORGE Who do you like?
GEORGE I like DeSoto.
JERRY DeSoto? What did he do?
GEORGE Discovered the Mississippi.
JERRY Oh. like they wouldn't have found that anyway.
GEORGE All right, I've got to go down to the unemployment office. Wanna take a walk?
JERRY No I can't I've got some stuff to do then I've got to meet Keith at my apartment at three. I'm helping him move.
GEORGE What? The guy asked you to helo him move? Wow.
JERRY I know isn't that something?
KRAMER He's got money. Why doesn't he just pay a mover?
JERRY I don't know ... he's got some valuable antiques, He's worried they'll break something.
GEORGE The next thing you know, he'll have you driving him to the airport..
JERRY I'm not driving him to the airpor!!
GEORGE I gave. I gave everything I could Mrs. Sokol. but nothing was good enough for her.
MRS._SOKOL Sign here please.
GEORGE Ha, I don't know who she's looking for. I don't know. I'll tell you something. She's very particular, your daughter. Very particular. What is she looking for some big hot shot businessman? Well I've got my pride too. I'm not going to beg her.
MRS._SOKOL All right just sign it. People are waiting.
GEORGE You, uh, you like baseball?
MRS._SOKOL That was autographed by the '86 Mets. I saw every inning that year.
GEORGE Funny, cause I happen to be very good friends with Keith Hernandez.
MRS._SOKOL You know Keith Hernandez.
GEORGE Know him? Would you, uh, like to meet him?
MRS._SOKOL Oh, come on. Come on.
GEORGE I can produce Keith Hernandez right here within the hour.
MRS._SOKOL All right. You got ONE hour.
GEORGE All right Mrs. S. I and my good pal Keith Hernandez will be right back.
GEORGE 129 west 81st street and hurry.
GEORGE Goodbye
KEITH Better bring your gloves, it's freezing out there. It shouldn't take too long. I'd say maybe, oh, four hours. Really though, Jerry, there's not that much. First we got the bedroom, we got two dressers and the bed.
JERRY Is there a box spring?
KEITH What's that?
JERRY Is there a box spring?
KEITH Yeah there's a box spring but it's attached to the headboard and we'll have to take that apart. Then we got the couch.
JERRY Is that a sectional?
KEITH Yeah. Twelve pieces. ...coffee table.
JERRY Is that a thick marble?
KEITH Three inches thick. Got it in Italy. But the BIG problem is going to be the convertible sofa. You see when you move it it tends to open up so it's going to be real difficult getting it down the stairs.
JERRY STAIRS??? There's no elevator?
KEITH Nah, it's a brownstone. Three floors.
JERRY I'm sorry I can't do this. I can't do it. I can't. It, it's too soon. I don't know you. I can't help you move. I'm sorry. I can't. I just can't.
KRAMER Hello.
KEITH Hello.
KRAMER Oh, you don't remember me.
KEITH No should I
KRAMER Yeah, you should. I certainly remember you. Let me refresh your memory.
NEWMAN June 14th, 1987. Mets Phillies. You made a big error. Cost the Mets the game. Then you're coming up the parking lot ramp.
KEITH YOU said, "Nice game, pretty boy."
KRAMER Ah, you remember.
NEWMAN And then you spit on us.
KEITH Hey, I didn't spit at you.
NEWMAN Oh, yeah, right.
KRAMER No no no, well, then who was it?
KEITH Well lookit, the way I remember it I was walking up the ramp. I was upset about the game. That's when you called me pretty boy. It ticked me off. I started to turn around to say something and as I turned around I saw Roger McDowell behind the bushes over by that gravely road. ... Anyway he was talking to someone and they were talking to you. I tried to scream out but it was too late. It was already on its way.
JERRY I told you!
NEWMAN Wow, it was McDowell.
JERRY But why? Why McDowell?
KRAMER Well, maybe because we were sitting in the right field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game.
NEWMAN He must have caught a glimpse of us when I poured that beer on his head.
NEWMAN It was McDowell.
KRAMER Oh boy. Uh, look uh, Keith, uh, we're sorry.
NEWMAN Yeah, I couldn't be sorrier. I uh.
KEITH look guys, don't worry about it, I uh, Well I guess I better get going.
KRAMER Wait, uh what are ya' doing?
KEITH I gotta move.
KRAMER Want any help?
KEITH I'd love some.
KRAMER I'd love to help you move.
NEWMAN Me too.
KEITH Ok guys, we gotta be careful of one thing. Some of the stuff's very fragile We're going to have to handle it like a baby.
KRAMER No sweat.
JERRY Hello, ... oh hi Elaine .. what's going on ... no he just left ... you broke up with him? ... ME TOO .. what happened? ... oh smoking you know you're like going out with C. Everet Coope ... me ... nah ... I couldn't go through with it ... I just didn't feel ready ... so what are you doing now? ... Oh, great idea, I'll meet you there in like thirty minutes. Okay bye.
GEORGE Keith, Keith Wa What happened? Where's Keith?
JERRY You just missed him. he just left. What do you need him for?
GEORGE Keith, Keith, up here. Can you do me a favor? I need you to go to the unemployment office with me. I, I'm Jerry's friend ... the guy from the locker room, ... I'm the chucker. It'll take five minutes. Wait. Wait.
JERRY Well Biff/ What's next?
GEORGE I don't know.
TALL_GIRL Excuse me. I was walking behind you and you dropped your wallet.
JERRY When You're moving your whole world becomes boxes. That's all you think about is boxes. Boxes, where are there boxes? You just wander down the street going in and out of stores. Are there boxes here? Have you seen any boxes? I mean it's all you think about. You can't even talk to people because you can't concentrate. Shut up I'm looking for boxes. Just after a while you become like really into it you can smell them. You walk into a store. There's boxes here. Don't tell me you don't have boxes. Dammit, I can SMELL them. I'm like I'm obsessed. I love the smell of cardboard in the morning. You could be at a funeral. Everyone's mourning crying around, and your looking at the casket. That's a nice box Does anyone know where that guy got that box? When he's done with it do you think I could get that? it's got some nice handles on it. And that's what death is really. It's the last big move of your life. The hearse is like the van. The pale bearers are your close friends the only ones you could ask to help you with a big move like that. and the casket is that great perfect box you've been waiting for your whole life The only problem is, once you find it you're in it.
GEORGE You want me to find a poem about Susan? May she rest in peace?!
WYCK Well, we think it would be a nice touch for the Foundation literature. Do you have a favorite poet, George?
GEORGE I like, uh...
WYCK Pardon?
GEORGE 
WYCK Well, you should choose the poem since you knew Susan best at the time of her unfortunate ...accident.
JERRY He cleared his throat?
GEORGE Yes!
JERRY So?
GEORGE He did it right as he said "her unfortunate accident."
JERRY Not getting it.
GEORGE Jerry, a throat-clear is a non-verbal implication of doubt - he thinks I killed Susan!
JERRY Oh, help me, Rhonda.
GEORGE What time is it?
JERRY 1:15.
GEORGE Right now?
JERRY I gotta go meet Pam.
GEORGE Oh, the bookstore girl. How's that goin'?
JERRY Okay. I'm just not ga-ga over her. For once I'd like to be ga-ga.
GEORGE Where's Elaine?
JERRY She's having Carol, Gail and Lisa over. You know they all have kids now?
GEORGE What's with all these people having babies?
JERRY Perpetuation of the species.
GEORGE Yeah! Right!
JERRY By the way, just for the record -
GEORGE No, I did not!
CAROL ...but because it comes out of your baby, it smells good!
ELAINE Well, that's...that's sweet.
GAIL Being a mother has made me feel so beautiful.
CAROL Elaine, you gotta have a baby!
ELAINE Oh, hey, you know...I had a piece of whitefish over at Barney Greengrass the other day...
LISA Elaine. Move to Long Island and have a baby already.
ELAINE I really like the city.
CAROL The city's a toilet. When's the last time you saw my little Adam?
ELAINE Uh, it was in the Hamptons.
CAROL Oh! I have pictures!
ELAINE No, no, that's okay, it's uh...
CAROL Look at him! Just look at him!
JERRY So, Elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had the other day...
GEORGE Do you really think I'm wrong about this Wyck guy?
JERRY You know, if you really want to test him out, why don't you try the old Jerry Lewis trick?
GEORGE Jerry Lewis?
JERRY I heard that when Jerry Lewis left a meeting, he'd purposefully leave a briefcase with a tape recorder in it. Then after five minutes, he'd come back for it and listen to what everyone said about him.
GEORGE That's pretty paranoid.
JERRY Yes, it is.
GEORGE I like it!
JERRY I thought you might.
PAM Oh, hi! I'm Pam. You must be Kramer. Jerry's told me a lot about you. Well, I'm supposed to meet Jerry, it's my day off. I work in a bookstore.
KRAMER Books.
PAM Oh, careful!
JERRY Hi, sorry I'm late.
PAM That's okay. Kramer let me in.
JERRY You know, if we rush, we can still make the movie.
PAM Okay. It was really nice meeting you.
KRAMER I'm in trouble, buddy. I just met a woman.
NEWMAN Go on.
KRAMER Well, she's Jerry's girlfriend.
NEWMAN Ah, yes. Forbidden love.
KRAMER She works in a book shop. Her name is Pam.
NEWMAN "Pam." I don't know the woman, but she sounds quite fetching.
KRAMER I can't even speak in front of her.
NEWMAN Jerry! What could she possibly see in Jerry?
KRAMER She has delicate beauty.
NEWMAN Jerry wouldn't know delicate beauty if it bludgeoned him over the head.
KRAMER And yet, he's my friend.
NEWMAN And therein lies the tragedy. For I believe, sadly for you, that there is but one woman meant for each of us. One perfect angel for whom we are put on this earth.
KRAMER Aw, that's beautiful, Newman.
NEWMAN One winsome tulip we ceaselessly yearn for throughout our dreary, workaday lives! And you, my friend, have found your angel. I can tell. For my heart has also been captured by a breathless beauty - whom I fear I will never possess.
KRAMER I thought we were talking about me.
NEWMAN Right. Kramer, you have to confront Jerry.
KRAMER Confront Jerry? I can't.
NEWMAN You must!
KRAMER I won't!
NEWMAN You will!
ELAINE "Elaine, ya gotta have a baby." Ugh.
GEORGE Where are all the poetry magazines?
ELAINE The New Yorker has poetry.
GEORGE Yes. The New Yorker.
JERRY Why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much?
ELAINE They're my friends, but they act as if having a baby takes some kind of talent.
JERRY C'mon, you want to have a baby.
ELAINE Why? Because I can?
JERRY It's the life force. I saw a show on the mollusk last night. Elaine, the mollusk travels from Alaska to Chile just for a shot at another mollusk. You think you're any better?
ELAINE Yes! I think I am better than the mollusk!
KEVIN I couldn't help overhearing what you were saying.
ELAINE Oh, I'm sorry.
KEVIN No, no, I think I agree with you. I mean, all this talk about having babies.
ELAINE Yeah, like you must procreate.
KEVIN Besides, anyone can do it.
ELAINE Oh, it's been done to death.
GEORGE I, uh, should have a poem very soon now.
WYCK Are you okay, George?
GEORGE No, no, not really. Ever since Susan passed on, I have good days and bad. Some days, I'm haunted by one word - why. Why Susan? Why wasn't it me licking those invitations? Why am I still here? Well, I gotta run.
WYCK ...and the stock options for this year look quite, uh...
GEORGE Briefcase.
ELAINE So, Kevin. If I don't want children, does that make me a bad humanitarian?
KEVIN Not at all.
ELAINE 'Cause, I mean, when you get to know me, you'll see that I'm a pretty good humanitarian. You are doing a wonderful job, by the way. Thanks a lot. Right? Am I right? Kramer. Kramer! Come here, look at my new friend Kevin. Oh, you got a little, uh...
KRAMER Oh, I just had two double-fudge sundaes.
ELAINE Oh. Are you alright?
KRAMER Yeah, I'll be okay.
ELAINE You know, Jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage.
KRAMER Well, I'm sure he'll be sharing his next one with Pam.
ELAINE Oh, no...that won't last.
KRAMER What do you mean?
ELAINE He's not ga-ga.
GEORGE Lemme tell you something, that Jerry Lewis? You wonder how some of these people get to the top? It's ideas like this! Brilliant! Hah-hah! Look at this - what the hell happened? The whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken.
JERRY How long did you leave it up there?
GEORGE Five minutes. What the hell happened here?
JERRY Play the tape, maybe we'll get a clue.
GEORGE I have to rewind it first. Alright, alright.
JERRY Is that it?
GEORGE Stopped dead.
JERRY What do you make of it?
GEORGE I don't know.
KRAMER Jerry. Uh, can we talk?
GEORGE Kinda busy here.
KRAMER I'd like to talk to Jerry in private.
GEORGE Why can't I stay?
KRAMER Because it doesn't concern you.
GEORGE Well, if it doesn't concern me, then I can stay.
JERRY So, what's on your mind?
KRAMER It's Pam.
JERRY Pam? What about Pam?
KRAMER I love her, Jerry!
JERRY You what?
KRAMER I love her!
JERRY Is that right?
KRAMER Oh, she's uh...she's real. She can bring home the bacon and fry it in the pan.
JERRY What does that mean?
KRAMER Oh, and that voice!
JERRY What about her name?
KRAMER Pam? Oh, it's a beautiful name. Pam. Pam. Pam!
JERRY She's got really nice hair.
KRAMER Oh, it's incredible. Although, I might replace her tortoise clip with one of those velvet scrunchies. I love those.
JERRY You've got really specific tastes.
KRAMER Oh, I know what I want, Jerry.
JERRY She's got nice calves.
KRAMER Oh, she's a dreamboat. But, you don't like her, so...
JERRY Maybe I could, you're making some pretty good points.
KRAMER No you can't, Jerry.
JERRY But I might.
KRAMER Oh, no you don't.
JERRY Why not? The voice? The calves? The bacon?
KRAMER What...?
JERRY I think I can! I even like the name! Pam!
KRAMER Huh?
JERRY Pam!
KRAMER Huh?
JERRY Pam!
KRAMER Huh-yah!
KRAMER So now he wants her more than ever!
NEWMAN Blast!
KRAMER What am I gonna do, huh?
NEWMAN Don't despair, my friend. I won't allow your love to go unrequited. Not like mine.
KRAMER What, again with you?
NEWMAN Sorry. But love is spice with many tastes. A dizzying array of textures...and moments.
KRAMER If only I could say things like that around her.
NEWMAN Yes...
ELAINE Well, I hear three distinct sounds. A low rumple...followed by a metallic 'squink'...
GEORGE Yes! Yes, I heard the 'squink'!
ELAINE ...followed by a mysterious...'glonk.'
GEORGE It's baffling, isn't it?
ELAINE Well, one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcase?
GEORGE They would never tell me, Elaine. First of all, they probably think that I killed Susan. Besides, I don't even think they like me.
JERRY That Pam! I am ga-ga over her!
ELAINE Ga-ga? When did that happen?
JERRY Yesterday. Six-ish.
ELAINE Well, maybe we should double. I'm pretty ga-ga myself.
JERRY You just met the guy yesterday.
ELAINE Yeah, but we have a common goal.
JERRY A barren, sterile existence that ends when you die?
ELAINE Yeah.
GEORGE And you really believe this guy doesn't want to have kids.
ELAINE Yeah, of course.
JERRY Elaine, a guy'll say anything to get a woman.
ELAINE Oh, please. He wouldn't say that.
GEORGE Elaine, I once told a woman that I coined the phrase, "Pardon my French."
JERRY I once told a woman that I don't eat cake 'cause it goes right to my thighs.
GEORGE I once told a woman that I really enjoy spending time with my family.
NEWMAN With your looks and my words, we'll have built the perfect beast.
PAM Oh, hi! Kramer.
NEWMAN Hi. How are you?
KRAMER Hi. How are you?
PAM I'm great.
NEWMAN I too am well.
KRAMER I too am well.
NEWMAN Do I smell Pantene?
KRAMER Do I smell?
NEWMAN Pantene!
KRAMER Uh, Pantene.
PAM Oh, my shampoo. Yeah, it is Pantene, I got a free sample in with my junk mail.
KRAMER Well, there really is no junk-mail...well, everybody wants to get a check or a birthday card, but...
NEWMAN ...it takes just as much man-power to deliver it as their precious little greeting cards...
KRAMER Newman!
PAM What?
KRAMER Uh, human. It's...human to be moved by a fragrance.
PAM That's so true.
KRAMER Her bouquet cleaved his hardened...
NEWMAN Shell.
KRAMER ...shell. And fondled his muscled heart. He embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
PAM Kramer, that is so lovely.
KRAMER It's by an unknown 20th-century poet.
PAM Oh, what's his name?
KRAMER Newman.
KEVIN Elaine, you've changed my life.
ELAINE Oh, Kevin...you can go on and on about how you don't want kids...and it sounds, it sounds really nice, but...the truth is, I don't know if you mean it or not.
KEVIN I got a vasectomy this morning.
ELAINE Although, I have a hunch you mean it.
JERRY I just came by to tell you - I'm really, really happy about this relationship. Really happy.
PAM Oh. Well, that's um......nice.
JERRY'S_BRAIN A velvet scrunchie!
JERRY Kramer!
JERRY Hello, Newman.
NEWMAN Hello, Jerry. How's Pam?
JERRY Pam? What do you care?
NEWMAN Well, ta-ta!
JERRY Wait a minute!
JERRY Alright, Newman! This is it!
NEWMAN Easy, Jerry. Steady. You wouldn't want to lose your cool at a time like this.
JERRY Why not?
NEWMAN Because right now, I'm the only chance you've got.
JERRY C'mon.
JERRY I can't believe I'm losing Pam!
NEWMAN I know how you feel. For I, too, have a woman for whom I pine.
JERRY I thought we were talking about me.
NEWMAN Right.
JERRY Anyway, I don't need your help.
NEWMAN Oh, don't you? Joke boy? You really think you can manipulate that beautiful young woman like the half-soused nightclub rabble that lap up your inane "observations"?
JERRY Alright, Newman. What do I have to do to get you to stop pulling the strings for Kramer?
NEWMAN Well, there is a little something you can do for me...
JERRY C'mon, out with it.
NEWMAN It's about...Elaine.
JERRY Elaine? What does she have to - Oh no...
NEWMAN You dated her. Give me some inside information. Anything I can use!
JERRY Well, I know she doesn't want to have kids.
KEVIN I thought you'd be a little more enthusiastic about it.
ELAINE I know, I don't want......kids.
KEVIN What was that?
ELAINE Well, Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt. I mean, nothing is a hundred percent.
KEVIN This is! Oh boy, I always do this.
ELAINE What?
KEVIN Oh, I get all jazzed up about something and I go way to far with it.
ELAINE Really?
KEVIN Oh, yeah. Like last summer. I'm watchin' TV and I saw one of those jet-skis. $4000 later and it's sitting in my garage.
ELAINE You know, that's weird, actually, 'cause I'm sort of the same way. I mean once for like, no reason, I flattened my hair and I had all these strands hanging in my face all the time...
KEVIN Sometimes I think I do want kids. Maybe a lot of kids!
ELAINE Sometimes I think about wearing my hair real short.
KEVIN Yeah! I think I like short hair. Really short.
ELAINE Yeah!
KEVIN Yeah!
GEORGE This is a crude mock-up of the conference room. 1/14th scale.
JERRY When did you build this thing?
GEORGE Yesterday, took the day off. Now, from the time I left the room...
JERRY Wait, that's you?
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY I really think the M&M should be you.
GEORGE Alright, whatever! Now. Whatever caused the damage......was jarring enough to completely stop the tape.
JERRY And?
GEORGE Okay. That's what we know.
JERRY But we already knew that.
GEORGE Well, yeah.
JERRY Just give me some idea of what you think it could be.
GEORGE I don't know if you're ready for it.
JERRY Please.
GEORGE I believe that I am about to become the target of a systematic process of intimidation and manipulation, the likes of which you have never -
JERRY Hold it, hold it! You're right, I'm not ready for this. Yeah?
VOICE_ON_SPEAKER It's Pam.
JERRY C'mon up. Alright, it's Pam, you gotta get goin.'
GEORGE I'm not through here, Jerry. I'm gonna keep on investigating. This thing is like an onion. The more layers you peel, the more it stinks.
PAM What was that?
JERRY We were just playin.'
PAM Listen, I had a long talk with Kramer today...
JERRY Uh huh...
PAM Well, the thing is, I uh...I think I have a little crush on him.
KRAMER I'm so happy! My world suddenly has meaning!
JERRY This is the man you have a crush on?
PAM Well, I have feelings for both of you.
KRAMER How can you have feelings for him? We're soul mates.
JERRY Why can't I be a soul mate?
KRAMER Jerry, you really think that Pam would want you to be the father of her children?
PAM Children? Who said anything about children? I don't want to have children.
GEORGE There are some people in this room who would have been very happy to never see this briefcase again. There are people in this room who think they can destroy other people's property and get away with it. Well, let me tell you something about those people. They weren't counting on this brain! And this tape recorder.
WYCK George...
GEORGE You'll have your turn! The truth must be heard. That's all there was. And yet, it speaks volumes. A low rumple. A metallic 'squink.' A 'glonk.' Someone crying out..."Dear God!" Let's start with, uh...with you, Wyck.
WYCK George, Quinn here was moving a chair...he lost his balance and dropped it...it must have fallen on your briefcase, which, for some reason, contained a running tape recorder?
GEORGE Alright, then. We've gotten to the bottom of that.
ELAINE What are you guys doing here?
JERRY We're getting vasectomies.
ELAINE Why?
NEWMAN I'm doing it for you.
ELAINE What?
JERRY What'd you do to your hair?
ELAINE I cut it.
JERRY It's a little short.
KEVIN Y'think?
JERRY What are you doing here?
ELAINE Kevin's having his vasectomy reversed.
JERRY_AND_NEWMAN Reversed?!
GEORGE ...he embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
WYCK Is that a Keats poem?
GEORGE No, it's a Newman. Well, I gotta run.
WYCK Does anyone think George might have murdered Susan?
MR._CROSS Oh, yeah. I just assumed he murdered her.
MS._BAINES Of course he killed her.
WYCK So it's not just me, then. Alright! Back to business.
GEORGE That guy was amazing, he could dunk and he was my height...What was his name again?
JERRY Jimmy
GEORGE Jimmy, right.
JERRY I dunno how you could forget . He kept reffering to himself in the third person. Jimmy's under the boards. Jimmy's in the open. Jimmy makes the shot.
GEORGE Ah! your just mad 'cause we beat ya.
KRAMER Jerry it's my fault .I couldn't make a shot. These losses they stay with me. They Jerry. Now this is gonna plague me. Oh! Mother!!!
GEORGE Hey! Jimmy!!! ha ha ha........Great game.

KRAMER Yeah
JIMMY These are Jimmy's training shoes.

JIMMY Oh yeah! Jimmy couldn't jump at all before he got these. Jimmy was like you
KRAMER They're Plyometric.

GEORGE Wh...Where d'you get'em?
JIMMY Jimmy sells'em.

JIMMY All right
GEORGE All right Jimmy Good talking to ya.
JIMMY Jimmy'll see you around.

JERRY Yeah!
KRAMER Oh yeah.! I got a check up on Thursday.
JERRY Oh! How d'you like that?
KRAMER You know.. You really shouldn't brush 24 hours before seeing the dentist.
JERRY I think that's eat 24 hours before surgery.
KRAMER Oh no, you got to eat before surgery, you need your strength.
SCENE_TWO Meeting at Yankee Stadium.
WILHEM I called this meeting because we......have........a problem. For the last few months someone has been stealing equipment from the club. Until recently it's been little things, y'know; bases, batting helmets, donuts, but two nights ago they pulled the big one. The camera goes back and forth from Wilhem to George who keeps pulling on his collar he's sweating.
WILHEM They took a pitching machine, a batting cage ,the in-field tarp and all of Mr Steinbrenner's vitamins.. Now , we have reasons to believe it's an inside job.
GEORGE Whoa!!
WILHEM If anybody here knows anything about it I recommend strongly that...you come forward. Wilhem looks at George who's sweating so much it seems he's hiding something.
RECEPTIONIST Dr Whatley's running a little late. If you'd like to take a seat, I'll call you when he's ready.
JERRY All right.
ELAINE Oh! Okay. Right. Thanks Mr Pitt....'kay. ..goodbye.

KRAMER Hey! Got the new Penthouse
JERRY Where's my Mr. Goodbar?
KRAMER Ah! here here Listen...Dear Penthouse, I want to tell you about an experience I recently had. As an avid reader I've always wondered if the letters are I'm a dentist and one afternoon my hygienist and I decided to have a little fun with one of our patients. Of course none of our patients had any idea exactly of what we were up to. I was still wondering what if .........
JERRY Look at you. Why don't you use a fork? You're no good with the sticks.
ELAINE I know. I need a lesson.
JERRY You stink. You know you stink. What is this?
ELAINE Oh. My ballet tickets.
JERRY Oh. Your ballet tickets.
ELAINE Hey, have you ever been to the ballet?
JERRY No, but I've seen people on tiptoes.
ELAINE You know, I'm going as a beard.
JERRY A beard?
ELAINE Yeah. This friend of a friend knows this banker guy, he's, I don't know, 30 years, unbelievably gorgeous, of course he's gay.
JERRY Yes.
ELAINE So anyway his boss has a box at the Met and he invited us to see Swan Lake, which is fine, but he's afraid that his boss can't handle his orientation, so I'm going along as his date.
JERRY Why are you doing this?
ELAINE Swan Lake, at the Met. Kramer enters.
KRAMER Oh, Chinese food. I knew I smelled something.
ELAINE Hey, is George still wearing that toupee?
JERRY Yeah.
ELAINE Doesn't he know how ridiculous he looks in that thing?
KRAMER I think he looks fantastic.
ELAINE Oh, come on.
KRAMER No, I never realized what an attractive man he is. George enters, wearing a toupee.
GEORGE Hey, people, people, people, people, people. Not bad, huh? Excuse me.
ELAINE You look ridiculous in that thing.
GEORGE Is that so? Or could it be that you're just a little bit worried that you may have missed the boat?
ELAINE Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your brain.
GEORGE Ha ha ha ha, oh all right, go ahead, deride, deride if you must. But let me tell you something, with my personality and this set of hair, you know what I am now? I am in the game. I no longer defer to the coifed. I'm a player.
KRAMER You know I just thought of something. I know this gorgeous woman, she called me up this morning, she's moving into the city, and she asked me if I know of anyone she could meet. Now you can go out with her.
JERRY Well what about me?
KRAMER No I think he's got you beat buddy.
GEORGE So she's gorgeous.
KRAMER Oh yeah, last time I saw her she was, five years ago.
GEORGE Well have you got a picture?
KRAMER No.
GEORGE Well, I have to see her.
KRAMER Hey, I know what we can do. I've got a friend who works over at the police station. He's a composite artist.
GEORGE Really?
KRAMER Yeah, yeah, maybe I can get him to draw a picture of her for you.
GEORGE Oh I would love that. You think he'd really do it?
KRAMER Yeah, yeah. I think he will.
JERRY It sounds like an excellent idea.
KRAMER Hey Jerry, you want this, cause I'm going to give it to a homeless person. Jerry, George, and Kramer walking down the street.
GEORGE Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to see how those sketch artists do it.
KRAMER Here you go brother. Some food for you.
HOMELESS_MAN Thank you. You're a good man. Bless you.
KRAMER Now are you going to be here in an hour?
HOMELESS_MAN Where am I going? At the police station.
KRAMER Oh that's good, that's good. Make the eyes, uh, what's that nut?
LOU Almond?
KRAMER Almond. Yeah. Make the lips fuller. Poutier.
GEORGE Pouty? I like that.
JERRY You can't go wrong with pouty.
GEORGE I'm excited about the pouty.
LOU All right I think that about does it.
KRAMER All right George, come on, take a look.
GEORGE Oh yeah, you were right. She's gorgeous.
JERRY Hey, Lou, who's that woman over there?
LOU Oh, that's Sergeant Tierney. Nice officer. You want to meet her? Walking down the street.
GEORGE Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the police woman?
JERRY Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law on my side.
KRAMER Hey, man. Enjoy the food?
HOMELESS_MAN Yes I did. Where did the Chinese learn to cook like that?
KRAMER Oh, listen, I'll take that Tupperware now.
HOMELESS_MAN I don't think so.
KRAMER Woah, woah, that's mine.
HOMELESS_MAN You gave it to me.
KRAMER No, no, I didn't say you could keep it. You see I don't give away tupperware.
HOMELESS_MAN You should have said something.
KRAMER I didn't think I had to. Look with a piece of Tupperware you just assume. At the ballet.
ROBERT I've really got to thank you for this.
ELAINE Well by now, you think people would be a little more open minded.
ROBERT Really. Would you excuse me? I have to run to the bathroom.
BOSS'_WIFE So, um, you and Robert.
ELAINE Yes indeed.
BOSS I'm surprised.
ELAINE Really. Why?
BOSS No reason.
ELAINE Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's not exactly a one woman man, if you know what I mean. No sirree Bob. Sure, I mean in a lot of ways, he's a typical guy, he likes his sports, but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet, or the pleasure he gets in watching Ms. Liza Minelli belt out a few choice numbers. It's those two halves of his personality that just come together to make him the very special guy that he is. Robert comes back.
ELAINE Oh, hi honey. Elaine grabs Robert and kisses him. At Monk's.
ELAINE Oh it was such a great night.
JERRY And did they suspect anything?
ELAINE No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him honey.
JERRY And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals.
ELAINE Oh it was such a great night. Oh.
JERRY You said that already.
ELAINE Oh I did?
JERRY Yeah.
ELAINE Oh.
JERRY Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?
ELAINE He's incredible.
JERRY Yeah, but?
ELAINE Yeah, I know.
JERRY So?
ELAINE What?
JERRY Not conversion. You're thinking conversion?
ELAINE Well it did occur to me.
JERRY You think you can get him to just change teams? He's not going to suddenly switch sides. Forget about it.
ELAINE Why? Is it irrevocable?
JERRY Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes his team. He's set with that team.
ELAINE We've got a good team.
JERRY Yeah, we do. We do have a good team.
ELAINE Why can't he play for us?
JERRY They're only comfortable with their equipment.
ELAINE We just got along so great.
JERRY Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's no possibility of sex.
ELAINE No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something. I perceived a possibility Jerry.
JERRY You realize you're venturing into uncharted waters.
ELAINE I realize that.
JERRY Are you that desperate?
ELAINE Yes I am. At Jerry's apartment. He is on the phone.
JERRY So are you going to bring your gun?... All right, then it's settled. First date, no weapons... All right I'll see you then... Okay, bye. Kramer enters. He goes into the kitchen and starts searching.
JERRY What are you looking for?
KRAMER Tupperware.
JERRY Sorry. I don't have any tupperware.
KRAMER I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious casserole, but now it won't keep because I have no Tupperware.
JERRY What about a plastic bag?
KRAMER You must be kidding.
JERRY What is the difference?
KRAMER The patented burp, Jerry. It locks in freshness. George enters.
GEORGE So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night.
KRAMER Oh yeah, you talked to her.
GEORGE Yeah for two hours. She's nuts about you.
KRAMER Yeah well we go way back.
GEORGE Why didn't anything happen between you two?
KRAMER Who's to say it didn't?
JERRY So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?
GEORGE Yes I did.
JERRY What did you say to her?
GEORGE What do you think I said?
JERRY I don't know.
GEORGE I told her the truth.
JERRY As you see it?
GEORGE Yes, as I see it.
JERRY Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?
GEORGE What hat?
JERRY You know, you're little hair hat there.
GEORGE No.
JERRY Don't you think she could tell?
KRAMER No, no, no she can't tell. It's a perfect match. Beautiful job.
JERRY Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks away.
GEORGE You only think that because you know me.
JERRY Have you noticed people staring at your head?
GEORGE I noticed people staring at my head because they like what they see.
JERRY Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it.
KRAMER No he's not going to take it off. If he was going to go over there bald, I never would have introduced him.
GEORGE Look, I guarantee she won't know.
KRAMER Yeah that's it. All right, I'm going to go down to the precinct. I'm going to have lunch with Lou.
JERRY Oh, I'll split a cab with you. Walking down the street.
KRAMER Hey I'm really sorry about the other day. Really sorry. Kramer drops something into the man's cup.
HOMELESS_MAN Hey that's my coffee! At the police station
JERRY Hi Sarge.
TIERNEY Hi, I'm sorry I'm late. Some of our lineup decoys didn't show. Hey any of you guys want to be in the lineup? Make a quick 50 bucks?
KRAMER Sure. I will.
TIERNEY Perfect. Just go over there with officer Lampert. In the lineup room. 6 men stand there, one of which is Kramer.
OVER_THE_SPEAKER All of you, turn to the left. Everyone turns left. Kramer turns right.
OVER_THE_SPEAKER The left. Kramer turns left.
OVER_THE_SPEAKER Now turn to the right. Kramer turns to the right doing a "hokey pokey" dance. At Monk's.
GEORGE Oh my god, there she is. That's the face, just like the picture.
DENISE George?
GEORGE Yeah. Hi. It's great to meet you.
DENISE Likewise. Have you been waiting long?
GEORGE No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago.
DENISE Good, good.
GEORGE Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile. Camera is on George. Denise takes off her hat. The camera is still on George. His expression changes to surprise. At the police station.
JERRY What's that?
TIERNEY A polygraph. It's what you civilians call a lie detector test.
JERRY Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that their pants are actually on fire?
TIERNEY If I could tell you the famous faces that have been up here. A certain cast member of Melrose Place.
JERRY Really.
TIERNEY Have you ever seen the show?
JERRY No.
TIERNEY You can admit it Jerry. It's okay.
JERRY I admit it. I don't watch it.
TIERNEY Hey Lou, maybe we should put him on the poly.
JERRY The poly?
TIERNEY Yeah. I think you've seen it. At Jerry's apartment.
ELAINE Melrose Place?
JERRY Yes. Melrose Place.
ELAINE I just didn't know you watched that.
JERRY Well I do.
ELAINE I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation.
JERRY Well maybe I was a little embarrassed.
ELAINE You mean this whole time we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane...
JERRY And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed it.
ELAINE Why? Why were you so embarrassed?
JERRY The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle's going to be going wild.
ELAINE That is so stupid. Why don't you just confess?
JERRY It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing to.
ELAINE So what are you going to do?
JERRY I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine.
ELAINE Oh, who do you think you are? Castanza?
JERRY Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful, duplicitous, deceptive minds of our time. Who better to advise me? Elaine takes a drink of something.
ELAINE Oh god this tastes terrible.
JERRY Did you shake it up?
ELAINE No.
JERRY You gotta shake it up.
ELAINE No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything. Jerry picks up the bottle and shakes it gently.
JERRY Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me.
ELAINE So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife.
JERRY So tonight are you going to make the move?
ELAINE Yeah, I think I might. George enters.
JERRY Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it?
GEORGE That's an interesting question.
JERRY How so?
GEORGE How so? I'll tell you how so. She's bald!
ELAINE What do you mean bald?
GEORGE What do you think I mean bald? Bald. Bald bald.
JERRY She's bald?
GEORGE She's bald.
ELAINE Oh come on.
GEORGE Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there she was hello. It was like I was looking at myself in the mirror.
ELAINE Well maybe she got a haircut or something.
GEORGE Let me tell you something. No one walks into a beauty parlor and says "Give me the Larry Fine."
JERRY Women go bald?
ELAINE Yeah, I've heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig. Kramer enters.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER Hey.
GEORGE You fixed me up with a bald woman. Kramer flinches.
KRAMER Bald?
GEORGE Yeah, that's right.
ELAINE Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because they're bald.
GEORGE So?
ELAINE You're bald!
GEORGE No I'm not. I was bald. Elaine grabs at the toupee, George dodges the grab.
GEORGE Elaine. Elaine grabs again and misses. George turns around and opens the door trying to get out. Elaine grabs the toupee and runs to the window.
GEORGE No, no, no Elaine.
ELAINE I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm doing with it. She tosses the toupee out the window.
GEORGE Nooooo. He runs to the window, and the blind comes down on his head. Outside. The homeless man is walking down the street and sees the toupee. He puts it on. At Elaine's apartment.
ROBERT Hahaha, why'd you start that fight with me?
ELAINE Well I figured that's what couples do.
ROBERT You almost convinced me we were a couple.
ELAINE Well it was easy. Really.
ROBERT Well good night, I'll call you tomorrow.
ELAINE Oh, uh, wait a second. Would you like to come, upstairs?
ROBERT Upstairs?
ELAINE Yeah. Upstairs?
ROBERT Elaine...
ELAINE I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... changing teams?
ROBERT Changing teams?
ELAINE Have you ever thought about it?
ROBERT But I'm a starting shortstop.
ELAINE Robert, we need a shortstop. Real bad. At Monk's.
GEORGE I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I feel like my old self again. Totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic, it's a pleasure.
JERRY Good to have you back.
GEORGE And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to keep seeing the bald woman.
JERRY She's as good as anybody else.
GEORGE Her scalp was clean. She had a nice skull. There just wasn't a lot of hair on it.
JERRY Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like a bald-again.
GEORGE Going to need a little more coffee here.
JERRY So George, how do I beat this lie detector?
GEORGE I'm sorry, Jerry I can't help you.
JERRY Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can help me.
GEORGE Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, "Teach me to sing like you."
JERRY All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe I'm doing this.
GEORGE Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie... if you believe it. Outside on the street. Jerry and Elaine walking toward each other.
ELAINE Hey, I did it.
JERRY What?
ELAINE I turned him. He defected.
JERRY Get out! How? How did you do that?
ELAINE Because I'm a woman. Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom- boom.
JERRY Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to every woman who's ever said "Too bad he's gay".
ELAINE Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. Jeromy, I have hit the jackpot. The perfect man. Nothing but sex and shopping. At the police station. Kramer is in the lineup again. He and five other people walk into the room. They stand there for a few moments. Kramer points with his eyes to the man on his left. He then tilts his head a few times to the man on his left. Elsewhere at the police station. Jerry is hooked up to the polygraph.
LOU What's your name?
JERRY Jerry Seinfeld.
LOU What is your address?
JERRY 129 West 81st street.
LOU Did Kimberly steal Jo's baby?
JERRY I don't know. Camera shot on the polygraph. The pen moves back and forth on the paper.
LOU Did Billy sleep with Allison's best friend?
JERRY I don't know. Camera shot on the polygraph. The pen moves back and forth on the paper. Lou and Sergeant Tierney look at each other.
LOU Did Jane's finance kidnap Sydney and take her to Las Vegas? And if so, did she enjoy it?
JERRY I don't know.
LOU Did Jane sleep with Michael again?
JERRY Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, he slept with her sister. He tricked her into giving him half her business, and then she goes ahead and sleeps with him again. I mean she's crazy. How could she do something like that? Oh that Jane, she makes me so mad. He picks up his coat and leaves. At Jerry's apartment.
JERRY He went back? What do you mean he went back?
ELAINE He went back.
JERRY I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, the sex, the shopping.
ELAINE Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what, thirty, forty-five minutes a week. And that's on a good week. How can I be expected to have the same expertise as people who own this equipment, and have access to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire lives.
JERRY You can't. That's why they lose very few players.
ELAINE Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance.
JERRY Well there's always a place for you, on our team.
ELAINE Yeah. Thanks. Is Melrose Place on?
JERRY Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.
ELAINE Okay. George enters.
JERRY Hey. Don't worry it hasn't started.
ELAINE Hey George, I am really proud of you. I really do admire what you've done.
GEORGE Do you? That makes me so happy. Elaine's proud of me Jerry.
ELAINE What is the matter?
GEORGE I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. Heh, you like that one? A woman with no prospects and no hair, told me that I wasn't her type. Apparently baldy likes a slimmer guy.
KRAMER Well I'll tell you what I think. I think she saw you with that piece off and was devastated. You blew it boy. You really blew it. And you had to ruin it for him. Didn't you?
ELAINE I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did, and it made him act like a jerk.
JERRY All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on. Theme song of Melrose Place plays on the TV.
JERRY Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug. At the police station. Kramer is in the lineup.
KRAMER Hey, how you doing Stu? Eddie, my man. You again? Boy, you're a slippery one. You'd better straighten up and fly right buddy boy.
MAN I've got an eyewitness to that jewelry store break-in. Come here. Do you recognize anybody in the lineup?
HOMELESS_MAN That's the guy officer. The guy there in the middle. The tall guy with the, with the high hair. I'd recognize him anywhere.
MAN Hey you, you with the high hair, step forward.
KRAMER Me?
JERRY It is pretty hard to justify, at this point in history, the existence of men and their handkerchiefs. I mean, they open it up, blow their nose in it, and then put it back in their pockets with their other valuables. Wallet, keys, mucous, yup, I've got everything. Is it because men can't give birth that they're just proud of anything that comes out of us? We actually have a monogram sewn on to them. What is the source of pride here? We actually have it sticking out of the breast pocket of our jacket. "I have a snot rag."
MR._LIPPMAN To your promotion.
ELAINE Oh, thank you! Oh, thank you, Mr Lippman, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. I mean, of course I deserve it.
MR._LIPPMAN Well, you're really on your way now.
ELAINE You really oughtta do something about that cold.
JERRY You got a raise?
ELAINE I don't fool around, baby!
JERRY I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.
ELAINE They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that big Japanese conglomerate.
JERRY Oh, when did that happen?
ELAINE They're signing the papers next week.
JERRY Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?
ELAINE Yeah, they'll definitely do it now.
JERRY Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're back with Jake Jarmal.
ELAINE Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving in together.
JERRY Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen "Girlie" Brown would be very proud of you.
JERRY Speaking of having it all ... Where were you?
GEORGE I went to the beach.
JERRY Oh, the beach.
GEORGE It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working.
JERRY What is it that isn't working?
GEORGE Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much promise. I was personable, I was bright. Oh, maybe not academically speaking, but ... I was perceptive. I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party. It became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every of life, be it something to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong.
WAITRESS Tuna on toast, coleslaw, cup of coffee.
GEORGE Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, untoasted ... and a cup of tea.
ELAINE Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.
JERRY You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 'cos salmon swim against the current, and the tuna swim with it.
GEORGE Good for the tuna.
ELAINE Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you.
GEORGE So what? What am I supposed to do?
ELAINE Go talk to her.
GEORGE Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live with their parents, don't approach strange women.
JERRY Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.
GEORGE Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.
JERRY If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.
GEORGE Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do something!
GEORGE Excuse me, I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction.
VICTORIA Oh, yes I was, you just ordered the same exact lunch as me.
GEORGE My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.
VICTORIA I'm Victoria. Hi.
JERRY Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, alright ... okay, bye.
KRAMER Hey. Buddy, it's all happening!
JERRY What's happening?
KRAMER The coffee table book. It's a go!
JERRY Oh yeah, I heard all about it.
KRAMER You know what this means? I'm starting the book tour. First stop: Regis and Kathy Lee.
JERRY You're going on Regis and Kathy Lee?
KRAMER Oh, you better believe it!
JERRY I'll loan you my puffy shirt.
KRAMER No,no,no.
JERRY What're you gonna talk about?
KRAMER Well, coffee tables.
JERRY Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye.
JERRY You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes later get another, same weekend, same money.
KRAMER You know who you are? Even Steven
VICTORIA Are you growing a beard?
GEORGE Why shave every day? It just grows right back.
VICTORIA I guess ...
GEORGE I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn't gonna work.
VICTORIA Hey watch, he just cut you off! Did you see that?!
GEORGE Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not the end of the world. Cut to the movie theater; two young men are sitting behind G and Victoria
MAN_1 Hey baby, how about a little tongue action, huh?
MAN_2 Yeah, stick your tongue down his throat!
VICTORIA What are we gonna do? Shall we just move?
GEORGE That won't be necessary.
GEORGE Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll shut'em for ya, and if you think I'm kidding, just try me. Try me. Because I would love it!
VICTORIA Are you sure you don't wanna come up, I mean, it's only nine thirty.
GEORGE I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.
VICTORIA Who are you, George Costanza?
GEORGE I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.
THEATER_MANAGER Excuse me, is your name Elaine?
ELAINE Yes.
THEATER_MANAGER Were you suposed to meet a Jake Jarmal here?
ELAINE Yeah.
THEATER_MANAGER Well, I'm afraid he's been in an accident.
ELAINE An accident? What happened?
THEATER_MANAGER He got side-swiped by a cab, but he's alright. He's in St.Vincent Hospital, room 907.
ELAINE Oh. Ok. Thank you.
ELAINE Could I have a box of Jujyfruit?
JAKE So, then, you know, the light was clearly green, I started walking, he skidded and he went right into my hip.
ELAINE Oh, that is so terrible. That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? Just sickening.
ELAINE You want one?
JAKE No thanks.
ELAINE So when do you think you're gonna get outta here?
JAKE Where did you get those?
ELAINE At the movies.
JAKE Didn't the theater manager give you the message before you went in?
ELAINE Yeah, he did.
JAKE Then when did you get those?
ELAINE Right after ... that ...
JAKE So you heard that I was in a car accident , and then decided to stop off for some Jujyfruit?
ELAINE Well... the counter...was right there, and...
JAKE I would think, under the circumstances, it would have sent you running out the building. Apparently, it didn't have any effect on you.
ELAINE No, no, it does!
JAKE If you got into a car accident, I can guarantee you I wouldn't stop for Jujyfruit!
ELAINE But...Jake...
JAKE I would like to be alone now, please.
ELAINE But, Jake, I didn't...
JAKE Goodnight!
MAN_1 Ah, whaddya say we call it a night?
MAN_2 Good idea, I'm kinda tired.
MAN_3 How'd you do?
MAN_4 Won 50.
MAN_2 Lost 72.
MAN_1 Won 37.
MAN_3 Lost 15.
JERRY Broke even.
REGIS Can I bring out our next guest now?
KATHY_LEE Please, please.
REGIS Young guy, he's got a new book coming out, and it's about, and this is the best part -
KATHY_LEE I love this.
REGIS It's a coffee table book about coffee tables!
KATHY_LEE Yeah. Is that clever? I think that is so clever!
REGIS I think so too. Did you get to meet him back stage?
KATHY_LEE I did.
REGIS I mean, he looks like a fun guy, doesn't he?
KATHY_LEE I love his hair.
REGIS Yeah, oh, I do too. This guy could be a little bonkos. Really. Anyway, if you will, would you please welcome: Kramer!
KATHY_LEE I don't know, maybe it's the hair or something!
REGIS Kramer. So, a coffee table book about coffee tables. Where did you come up with this idea?
KRAMER Yeah, well, ah, I'll tell you, Regis... actually, this is a true story. I was skiing at the time.
REGIS You know, when I'm skiing, Kramer, I'm trying not to kill myself, and you're writing books!
KRAMER Yeah, well, now you kids don't go out and try that. You stay in school!
KATHY_LEE Have you always had an interest in coffee tables, because, really, I love coffee tables, and I thought I was the only one.
KRAMER You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table, it turns into a coffee table.
KATHY_LEE Is that fabulous?
REGIS Look at this!
KATHY_LEE Is that fabulous?
REGIS Fabulous!
KATHY_LEE I want one of these.
REGIS Did I tell you this guy was bonkos?
KATHY_LEE This coffee table is full of pictures of celebrities' coffee tables.
KRAMER That's true. That's right.
REGIS Yeah? Well, I'm not in there. Where's mine?
KRAMER Oh, it's on file, right here.
REGIS I'm tellin' ya, this guy's bonkos! He really is!
KATHY_LEE But he's adorable.
REGIS We'll be right back.
JERRY So it's all over?
ELAINE Yeah, it got pretty nasty.
JERRY And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?
ELAINE It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab.
JERRY Why didn't you eat it in the cab?
ELAINE Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first.
ELAINE What's all this?
JERRY Played cards last night.
ELAINE Oh yeah? How'd you do?
JERRY Broke even.
ELAINE You always break even.
JERRY Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! I always even out!
ELAINE Do you have twenty bucks?
JERRY What for?
ELAINE Just gimme twenty bucks.
JERRY What the hell was that?
ELAINE Let's see if you get the twenty bucks back.
JERRY You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back.
ELAINE You know, things were going so good for me, you know, I got the job promotion, we were talking about moving in together -
JERRY Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first.
GEORGE Hey, I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this, something is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up was down, black was white, good was -
JERRY Bad.
GEORGE Day was -
ELAINE Night.
GEORGE Yes!
JERRY So you just did the opposite of everything?
GEORGE Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the travelling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I've ever had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Jerry, this is my religion.
JERRY So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ.
JERRY Elaine ... look! A twenty!
ELAINE Oh my God. Cut to Mr.Lippman's office
KRAMER Hey boss.
MR._LIPPMAN Kramer. Come in.
KRAMER How're you doin' there, big guy?
MR._LIPPMAN Have a seat.
KRAMER What, have you got yourself a cold?
KRAMER Wow, that's quite a honk! Get yourself some vitamin C with rose hips and bioflavenoids.
MR._LIPPMAN The reason I asked you in here, is I caught your appearance on "Regis and Kathy Lee" the other day and -
KRAMER It was pretty good, huh?
MR._LIPPMAN Anyway, the thinking here is that it would be best if you didn't do any more of these shows.
KRAMER Because of the coffee thing?
MR._LIPPMAN Kramer, I'm sorry.
KRAMER What about "Sonia Live"? Now you're not cancelling "Sonia Live"?
MR._LIPPMAN It's out -
KRAMER She's a doctor, I got a thing for her.
MR._LIPPMAN Kramer, I -
MR._CUSHMAN Why don't you tell me about some of your previous job experiences?
GEORGE Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman.
MR._CUSHMAN Go on.
GEORGE Alright, before that, I was in real estate. I quit, because the boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom. That was it.
MR._CUSHMAN Do you talk to everybody like this?
GEORGE Of course.
MR._CUSHMAN My niece told me you were different.
GEORGE I am different, yeah.
MR._CUSHMAN I gotta tell you, you are the complete opposite of every applicant we've seen.
MR._CUSHMAN Ah, Mr. Steinbrenner, sir. There's someone here I'd like you to meet. This is Mr. Costanza. He's one of the applicants.
MR._STEINBRENNER Nice to meet you.
GEORGE Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego!
MR._STEINBRENNER Hire this man!
SECRETARY Tina Robbins is here to see you.
MAN Who's that?
ELAINE Ah, it's my ex-roommate, she moved out four years ago, but I've been sub- letting my apartment from her.
MAN Alright, see ya. Hey.
TINA Please.
ELAINE Hi Tina.
TINA Hi Elaine.
ELAINE So, I haven't seen you in a while.
TINA Elaine, we have a problem.
ELAINE Well, what is it?
TINA You're getting kicked out.
ELAINE Kicked out?! Why?!
TINA Well, there's been a number of complaints.
ELAINE Yeah? Like what?
TINA Well, like last Thanksgiving you buzzed up a jewel thief.
ELAINE I didn't know who he was!
TINA That's why there's a buzzer.
ELAINE What else?
TINA Well, apparently, the week after that, you buzzed up some Jehova's Witnesses and they couldn't get them out of the building.
ELAINE What else have you got?
TINA Well, let's see. Cut to Monk's
JERRY I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe.
RACHEL I suppose...
JERRY Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.
RACHEL Jerry ...
JERRY Yes?
RACHEL I've been doing a lot of thinking.
JERRY Aha?
RACHEL Well, I don't think we should see each other any more.
JERRY Oh, that's okay.
RACHEL What?
JERRY Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else.
RACHEL You will?
JERRY Sure. See, things always even out for me.
RACHEL Huh?
JERRY It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while. And ... good luck!
RACHEL Yeah, you too.
JERRY The New York Yankees?!
GEORGE The New York Yankees!
JERRY Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle ... Costanza?
GEORGE I'm the assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm going on the road trips with them! I'll be on the plane... I'm working in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream, I'm busting, Jerry, I'm busting!
JERRY I can't believe it.
GEORGE And I' moving out of my parents' house, I'm taking that apartment on 86th street, remember the one we saw?
JERRY That's a great place!
GEORGE I'm back in business, baby!
JERRY George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.
GEORGE Hey!
JERRY Hi Elaine.
ELAINE Hi.
JERRY How're things going?
ELAINE How're things going? You wanna know how things are going? I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my apartment!
JERRY Why? Why are they doing that?
ELAINE I don't know! They have a list of grievances.
JERRY The jewel thief?
ELAINE Yeah, the jewel thief.
JERRY What else?
ELAINE I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. I gotta be out by the end of the month.
GEORGE Well, you could move in with my parents.
ELAINE Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to say, or was that just instinct?
GEORGE Instinct.
ELAINE Stick ... with the opposite.
JERRY Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, I have two friends, you were up, he was down. Now he's up, you're down. You see how it all evens out for me? Cut to Pendant Publishing
SECRETARY Mr. Lippman, the people from Matsushimi are here.
MR._LIPPMAN Alright... tell them I'll be right there. Well, this is it, Elaine. You know, without this merger, we'd be out on the street. Boy, they sure saved us.
INTERPRETER Mr Lippman, it is with great pride that we undertake this partnership with your company.
MR._LIPPMAN I ... I'm sorry, I can't shake your hand right now. It's germs.
JERRY Is that the end of it?
GEORGE Yeah, it's the last one.
ESTELLE I can't believe you're moving out. Kramer, is this true? Is it really happening? It's ... it's like a dream.
KRAMER Oh, it's true.
GEORGE Alright, let's go.
FRANK Don't get in trouble with the Yankees. You be nice.
GEORGE I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job.
ESTELLE Jerry, did you hear this?
JERRY He knows what he's doing.
GEORGE I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me, and I love you both very, very much.
JERRY Opposite.
ELAINE I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk!
JERRY Why'd you have to eat so many?
ELAINE Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing.
JERRY Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.
KRAMER Yeah, you knew he had a cold. How'd you expect him to blow his nose?
ELAINE Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's happened? I've become George.
JERRY Don't say that.
ELAINE It's true. I'm George! I'm George!
GEORGE Greetings, people. Greetings. Greetings and salutations. What a beautiful day for a ball game. Let's play two! Oh, I'll have the chicken salad on rye, my usual, you know what I get, darlin'. So, let's see, I had a little conversation today with Mr Don Mattingly - he's the first base man. We talked about his new batting stance, you know, I'm not crazy about it, but I said , "Danny, go with it 'till it stops workin'." Donny baseball. He's a helluva guy.
KRAMER Wait, wait, wait, that's too much. Mine was more than yours.
JERRY Ah ... let's call it even.
JERRY Coffee's a drink that seems to encourage a lot of accessories around it. Coffee cake, coffee table, coffee table book, clutches of people. Say what you want about alcohol, but not only are there not a lot of optional accessories, alcohol actually helps you get rid of things. Family, home, job, driver's license. In fact, at a certain point, the only thing you have to remember to get, is more alcohol And maybe a rag for your squeegee.
JERRY I never get enough sleep. I stay up late at night, cause I'm Night Guy. Night Guy wants to stay up late. 'What about getting up after five hours sleep?', oh that's Morning Guy's problem. That's not my problem, I'm Night Guy. I stay up as late as I want. So you get up in the morning, you're ..... , you're exhausted, groggy, oooh I hate that Night Guy! See, Night Guy always screws Morning Guy. There's nothing Morning Guy can do. The only Morning Guy can do is try and oversleep often enough so that Day Guy looses his job and Night Guy has no money to go out anymore.
ELAINE Do you ever spit on anybody from here?
JERRY No. You?
ELAINE No. Do you ever think about it?
JERRY Yeah.
ELAINE Me too.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER Well I got it!
JERRY You got me the air conditioner?
KRAMER What do you think?
JERRY Beautiful!
ELAINE What air conditioner?
KRAMER My buddy works in an appliance store and he got us thirty percent off.
JERRY Is it a good one?
KRAMER Good one? It's the Commando 8.
JERRY Commando 8?
KRAMER 12.000 BTU's.
ELAINE I thought you hated air conditioning. You've never had an air conditioner.
KRAMER Yeah, but Amy likes air conditioning.
ELAINE Oooh, you're getting an air conditioner for Amy. Amy doesn't like the temperature up here. She's a little hoooot.
JERRY All right.
KRAMER Okay, so, I'm gonna measure the window up, okay buddy?
JERRY Yeah.
KRAMER Yeah.
KRAMER Yeah, rock on!
GEORGE I gotta get out of this city.
JERRY So you're tunneling to the center of the Earth?
GEORGE I'm at the health club and while I'm in the pool, some guy walks off with my glasses. Who steals prescription glasses?
ELAINE You don't have an old pair?
GEORGE I broke 'em playing basketball.
JERRY He was running from a bee.
GEORGE Now if I wanna see anything I gotta wear these.
ELAINE George, those are prescription goggles? What is there to see in a health club pool?
JERRY There's a lot of change down there.
GEORGE When I find that guy, this much I vow: those glasses will be returned to their rightful owner.
JERRY We're behind you, Aquaboy. Godspeed!
GEORGE What kind of a sick, demented person wants another person's glasses?
ELAINE Yeah, especially those frames.
KRAMER You know you ought to do? Go see my friend Dwayne at J & T Optical and Columbus Avenue. He'll give you thirty percent off.
GEORGE Yeah, come on.
JERRY Hey, he just got me thirty percent off on an air conditioner.
GEORGE Really?
KRAMER Retail is for suckers.
GEORGE Wow. What do I have to do?
KRAMER You just gotta mention my name.
GEORGE That's it?
KRAMER That's it.
GEORGE What about these?
ELAINE They look good. I liked the other one too. I've liked about five of them.
GEORGE It's a tough decision. I have to wear these every day. I'm deciding on a new face.
JERRY Come on, George. Pick a face and go with it!
ELAINE Now those look good, they're very bold.
GEORGE Yes, they are bold. Jerry, what do you think?
JERRY I think these women would be pretty good looking if they weren't wearing glasses.
ELAINE Hi there, little doggy. Do you mind if I pet your dog?
DOG_OWNER It's okay with me.
ELAINE Hey little doggy.
ELAINE Aaah!
DWAYNE Hey, you can't have that dog in here.
JERRY Are you okay? Did he bite you?
GEORGE Can you believe that guy?
ELAINE I'm okay, it's just a nick.
GEORGE He just walked away! And once again I'm standing here like a little man. Well not this time!
GEORGE You! Dog man!
ELAINE My leg looks pretty bad.
JERRY Oh I'm gonna take you over to the emergency room.
ELAINE Okay.
JERRY Hey, any luck? Did you catch 'em?
GEORGE Uuh, no.
JERRY All right, I'm gonna take Elaine over to the hospital.
GEORGE Good, good, do that.
JERRY What's the matter?
GEORGE Oh, no, nothing.
JERRY What is it?
GEORGE I can't tell you.
ELAINE Jerry, can we go?
JERRY Yeah, yeah, in a second, in a second. What do you mean you can't tell me?
GEORGE I can't tell you, don't ask.
JERRY I'm asking!
ELAINE Jerry, my leg.
JERRY Yeah, yeah, take care.
JERRY Come on, George, what is it?
GEORGE I saw Amy making out with your cousin Jeffrey.
JERRY What?
GEORGE They were right outside!
JERRY Amy and Jeffrey?
GEORGE Yes!
JERRY Are you sure?
GEORGE Yes, positive.
JERRY But you can't see, there's no lenses in those frames.
GEORGE I know! I was squinting.
ELAINE Listen, Jerry, you just catch up with me okay? You can just follow the trail of blood.
JERRY We're gonna have to talk about this later.
JERRY Thank you. Taxi!
GEORGE Excuse me, what do you think of these?
DWAYNE Oh, we just got those in. It's a very exciting new frame.
GEORGE Yes, it is exciting! All right, this is gonna be my new face.
DWAYNE All right, you have a prescription?
GEORGE Yeah.
GEORGE Kramer...
DWAYNE What?
GEORGE Kramer...
DWAYNE What about him?
GEORGE You do know Kramer?
DWAYNE Yes...
GEORGE Well, I'm mentioning his name.
DWAYNE Why?
GEORGE Because... you know...
DWAYNE No, I don't know. Look, I'm gonna need a deposit on these.
ELAINE Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey? It's not possible!
JERRY Why not? They could have met. She loves the park, he works for the Parks Department.
ELAINE Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But, George didn't even have his glasses on!
JERRY But he was squinting.
ELAINE So what? Squinting doesn't make that much of a difference.
JERRY Are you kidding? I've seen 'em squint. He can squint his way down to like twenty, thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons, on the road!
DOCTER Okay.
ELAINE Okay? That's it? I don't need a shot?
DOCTER Not shot, dog bite.
ELAINE No, no, no. I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot?
DOCTER Not shot, dog bite. Woof woof, not bang bang.
JERRY Now, look at this. Cable's out.
AMY Oh that's okay, we don't have to watch tv.
JERRY No, no, no. No trouble at all, it's a principal the thing.
JERRY I like them to know that I know what's going on. That they're not... getting away with anything. Oh, I'm on hold. So, what did you do yesterday?
AMY Yesterday?
JERRY Yeah, you remember yesterday? Beautiful day... good day to be... out.
AMY I didn't do anything.
JERRY Oh you must have done something.
AMY No, nothing really.
JERRY Didn't go out of the house? Didn't take a walk... on Columbus Avenue?
AMY Well, I did go out for a little while.
JERRY Well, your day's getting more interesting already.
JERRY Ah, see, told me they'd be back in a minute and THEY lied.
AMY You can't thrust anyone.
JERRY No you can't. Now let's cut the ball, sister! You think I don't know about you swapping spit with somebody yesterday on Columbus Avenue?
AMY What are you talking about?
JERRY Look, my friend saw you.
AMY Saw me? With who?
JERRY You tell me.
AMY There's nothing to tell.
JERRY There isn't?
AMY No.
JERRY Oh... all right... wanna get some pizza?
AMY I had a feeling this was to good to be true.
JERRY Why?
AMY I knew there had to be another side to you.
JERRY No, no, there's no side!
AMY There is a side, an ugly side.
JERRY No, no, no ugly side.
AMY Look, I think I'm gonna go.
JERRY Why?
AMY It's really hot in here.
JERRY Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?
AMY Yeah. When are you getting an air conditioner?
JERRY It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat locker in here.
JERRY I was an idiot for listening to you!
GEORGE Hey, I saw what I saw.
JERRY Ooh, everything was going so well. She hadn't seen any flaws in me. Now she sees a side.
GEORGE What side?
JERRY A bad side, an ugly side.
GEORGE Ooh, so what?
JERRY So what? I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months. Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve.
GEORGE Why don't you just ask Jeffrey?
JERRY Ah, he'd just deny it.
GEORGE There must be some way to find out.
JERRY Amy said nothing happened.
GEORGE What, you're gonna take her word over mine? I'm your best friend!
JERRY Yeah, but you're blind as a bat!
GEORGE I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough? I was spotting those raccoons.
JERRY They were mailboxes, you idiot. I didn't have the heart to tell you.
GEORGE Hey look, a dime.
GEORGE Mercury head. You mind?
JERRY No, keep it.
JERRY Hey what happened to you? You buzzed five minutes ago.
ELAINE There was a dog in front of the building and it spooked me. I couldn't come in until he left.
JERRY A little white dog?
ELAINE Yeah.
JERRY Snowball? You were afraid of Snowball?
ELAINE I'm afraid of dogs now.
JERRY He's like a squirrel.
ELAINE Well he frightened me.
GEORGE Did you get the shot?
ELAINE No. He said I didn't need a shot.
GEORGE You got bit by a strange dog and you didn't get a rabies shot?
ELAINE What, you think I should have?
JERRY You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne if he knows the name of the owner of the dog.
ELAINE All right, that's a good idea. I'm gonna do that.
KRAMER The AC is on his way.
GEORGE Pardon me, I went to see your friend Dwayne... there was no discount.
KRAMER What?
GEORGE That's right, no discount!
KRAMER Well did you mention my name?
GEORGE Yes, I mentioned your name.
KRAMER And?
GEORGE Bubkis!
KRAMER Now I don't believe this. That guy owes me big time. I got him off sugar! Look, I'm gonna go down there with you right now.
GEORGE All right, let me just... I'm gonna grap an apple.
JERRY Hey, Kramer, Elaine's afraid of Snowball!
KRAMER Little Snowball? He runs on batteries!
ELAINE You know, George, that's an union.
GEORGE Yes it is.
ELAINE He couldn't tell an apple from an union and he's your eye witness?
GEORGE I saw them making out, you can believe it.
JERRY I don't know what to believe! You're eating unions, you're spotting dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on.
KRAMER Look, all you gotta to is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere, that's it.
JERRY Hey wait a second, wait a second. I'm going over to Jeffrey's apartment tomorrow night to pick up these Paul Simon tickets. I'm gonna surprise Amy. All I gotta do is bring her with me. And then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's Howdy Doody time.
KRAMER Right this way, mister Doody!
GEORGE You'll see I'm right.
KRAMER Hey, Dwayny.
DWAYNE Oh hello Kramer.
KRAMER What is going on here?
DWAYNE What are you talking about?
KRAMER I'm talking about the thirty percent discount.
ELAINE Uhm excuse me... uh... a man came in here...
GEORGE Elaine, don't interrupt, they're discounting something.
DWAYNE Who said anything about a discount.
KRAMER Ooh, how quickly we forget. You owe me buddy.
DWAYNE For what?
KRAMER Remember this?
DWAYNE What are you doing?
KRAMER Six months ago you were eating four of those for breakfast and chasing it with a ring ding. And two butter fingers on the train. Sounds familiar?
DWAYNE Put that away!
KRAMER Remember that night I found you at Dinky Donuts? You were all hopped up on cinnamon swirls! They wouldn't serve you anymore! You wouldn't even have any teeth if it wasn't for me taking you over to Joe's fruit stand and stuff a cantaloupe down your throat! So much for gratitude... yeah, yeah, yeah!
DWAYNE All right, all right, all right! I'll give him the discount, just put that thing away! This squares us.
ELAINE Can I just have the name...
DWAYNE Out!
KRAMER We'll see you Dwayne.
JERRY I don't know what to tell you, Elton.
ELAINE Oh oh, listen to this, this is not good, listen to these symptoms for rabies: anxiety, irritability. I got those, I'm irritable!
JERRY Who picked these out?
GEORGE I did!
JERRY They're ladies' glasses! All you need is that little chain around your neck so you can wear 'em while you're playing Canasta.
GEORGE Well Elaine was supposed to help me.
ELAINE Hey! I got bit by a dog! I had to go to the hospital! I was bleeding to death! I can't solve every little problem you have!
JERRY Hey, hey.
ELAINE I'm sorry... sorry.
KRAMER Commando 8 has arrived!
JERRY Take it to the window.
KRAMER 12.000 BTU's of raw cooling power.
KRAMER Installed!
GEORGE That's it? You don't have to screw it in or anything?
KRAMER No, just plug it in and the Commando 8 does the rest. I'll seal that up later, right?
JERRY Just in time for Amy.
GEORGE Oh yeah, when are you gonna execute that plead?
ELAINE I've got such a headache. Oh, that's another symptom!
KRAMER Of what?
JERRY Rabies.
KRAMER Oh that's fatal, you don't want that!
ELAINE I know I don't want it! I don't need you to tell me what I don't want, you stupid hipster dufus!
JERRY Hey, hey, what is this? What's going on here?
ELAINE I'm sorry, Kramer, I'm sorry.
KRAMER No, no, it's all right. I had a friend who had rabies once.
KRAMER May I have one of those, madam?
GEORGE Madame? What are you calling me madam for?
KRAMER They're ladies' glasses.
KRAMER Now look here, see it's right here: Gloria Vanderbilt Collection.
GEORGE He sold me ladies' glasses!
ELAINE I... I think I'm... I'm having trouble swallowing. I can't... I can't swallow.
KRAMER She's got rabies, just like my friend Bob Sacamano. She's delirious.
KRAMER She's foaming at the mouth!
ELAINE Is this gonna hurt?
DOCTER Yes, very much.
ELAINE What if Jeffrey's not home. Did you ever think of that?
JERRY Oh he'll be home, it's Friday night. That's the big night on the Nature Channel.
ELAINE Let me tell you this: there is no way cousin Jeffrey is dating Amy. He looks like a horse!
JERRY He does look like a horse.
ELAINE Yeah, he's got a real horse face. Here, look at this! It's the guy with the dog! Hey! You down there! Remember me? I had to get shot because of your stupid dog!
DOG_OWNER Who are you calling stupid?
JERRY Hey, shall we spit on him?
ELAINE No no no no, come on, let's go downstairs.
KRAMER Oh myyyy papayaaaa.
KRAMER The air conditioner!
KRAMER I think it got the dog!
GEORGE Oh boy.
BLIND_MAN Excuse me, I'm new here, would you mind walking me back to my locker?
GEORGE Oh uuh, sure, hang on. Hey, that's the guy.
BLIND_MAN What guy?
GEORGE The guy that stole my glasses. This time I got 'em!
GEORGE Would you pick it up a little?
BLIND_MAN Where the hell are we going?
GEORGE He's getting on a bus, damn! Those are nice glasses.
BLIND_MAN I don't like 'em, they pinch my nose.
GEORGE Is that really?
GEORGE Dwayne, my friend and I would like to exchange frames. Could you put his lenses in my frames and mine in his?
DWAYNE Yeah, we can do that.
GEORGE And I'd like a discount.
DWAYNE Why should I give you a discount.
GEORGE Listen, you're lucking I'm not asking for a refund. You gave me ladies' frames!
BLIND_MAN What's that about ladies' frames?
DOG_OWNER I'm trying to track down that lady that was in here the other day, the one that was messing with my dog.
GEORGE Yeah, well, she's trying to track you down.
DOG_OWNER Well I would love to talk with her. She lives on 81st Street, right?
GEORGE No, that's Jerry.
DOG_OWNER Really? You wouldn't happen to know what apartment he's in, would you?
GEORGE Yeah, 5A!
DOG_OWNER Thanks a lot!
AMY So what are we doing here?
JERRY Oh, you'll find out.
AMY I don't know, you're acting very mysteriously.
JERRY Well, I'm very mysterious by nature.
JERRY A lot of women find that attractive.
AMY I find it annoying.
JERRY Really?
UNCLE_LEO Helloooo!
JERRY Uncle Leo!
UNCLE_LEO Come on in.
JERRY This is Amy.
UNCLE_LEO Hello Amy.
JERRY Unlce Leo, what are you doing here?
UNCLE_LEO Jeffrey went out tonight.
JERRY Ooh! Very convenient.
UNCLE_LEO I'm supposed to tape this nature show for him, he loves nature. Botany, zoology. You know his botany teacher from college stays in close touch with him? They became friends!
JERRY Oh really?
UNCLE_LEO That's pretty rare! I mean, actual friends! Like equals! They have dinner together, they have discussings...
JERRY Uncle Leo! Did he leave any tickets here for me?
UNCLE_LEO Oh yeah yeah, I'll get 'em.
JERRY Thank you.
AMY What tickets?
JERRY To the Paul Simon concert in the park!
AMY We're going to the Paul Simon concert?
JERRY That's right, lady!
AMY Oh what a great surprise!
JERRY I thought you'd like that.
AMY Oooh, that's why you've been acting so mysteriously.
JERRY Now you know. That, and that alone, is the reason.
UNCLE_LEO Hear Jeffrey's favorite animal: the leopard.
AMY Why is that?
UNCLE_LEO He likes the spots. Oh uh, here's the tickets.
JERRY Thank you.
UNCLE_LEO Oh uh, he asked me to give you a message. He said that he's very sorry and he hopes you'll forgive 'em.
JERRY Aha! So it's true! You were making out with him!
AMY What are you talking about, I don't know Jeffrey. Oh so this is why you brought me up here?
JERRY Oh very convincing, but it's not gonna work this time.
UNCLE_LEO What are you talking about? All he meant was that he was sorry that the seats aren't very good.
JERRY Oh... oh... wanna get some pizza?
GEORGE Wait, these really do pinch the nose.
BLIND_MAN Tough luck! Deal's a deal.
GEORGE Oh my got it is them.
JERRY I still don't know how you spotted that dime. I think you planted it. Plus I've got to pay that vet bill for the stupid dog. I don't know how that guy got my name.
GEORGE Yeah. Boy these really do pinch. I tell you, if I ever find the son of a bitch that stole my glasses...
JERRY ...And it is embarrassing, because a doggie bag means either you are out at a restaurant when you aren't hungry, or you've chosen the stupidest possible way to get dog food that there is. How about the doggie bag on a date? That's a good move for a guy, huh? Lemme tell you something if you're a guy and you ask for the doggie bag on a date, you might as well have them just wrap up your genitals too. You're not going to be needing those for awhile, either.
JERRY Is that bothering you?
ELAINE No, not at all...
ELAINE Oh, could you please hurry?
JERRY "Please hurry". Look at you. Look at what you've become.
ELAINE What? What have I become? I haven't "become" anything...
JERRY Oh, Carl can't wait a few more minutes?
ELAINE I don't want to keep him waiting...
JERRY He'll like you more...
ELAINE That's impossible...
WIFE Andrew, why do you have to pick your teeth at the table?
HUSBAND Leave me alone.
JERRY Yeah, I'm wanting to get married real soon...
JERRY So, where am I dropping you?
ELAINE His place...
JERRY This guy's got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and then drop you off at his apartment...
ELAINE And he gets the rest of my chicken...
JERRY So, is tonight "the night"?
ELAINE You never know...
JERRY Oooh! Bay-bee doll!
JERRY Boy, do you smell something?
ELAINE Do I smell something? What am I, hard of smelling? Of course I smell something.
JERRY What is it?
ELAINE I think it's B.O.!
JERRY What?
ELAINE It's B.O. The valet must have had B.O.
JERRY It can't be. Nobody has B.O. like this.
ELAINE Jerry. It's B.O.
JERRY But the whole car smells.
ELAINE So?
JERRY So when somebody has B.O., the "O" usually stays with the "B". Once the "B" leaves, the "O" goes with it.
ELAINE I can't believe you ski!
CARL I'm a great skier.
ELAINE Yeah? What else?
CARL Let's see... I ski, I fish, I pillage, I plunder...
ELAINE Oh! You "pillage and plunder"?
CARL ...When I travel.
ELAINE See? Finally, finally I get to meet a man who pillages and plunders! I'm so lucky.
GEORGE This'll only take a second.
KRAMER Yeah, I'm going to poke around...
GEORGE Hey, whatd'ya know? Look at that! A lesbian sighting. Oh-ho! My lucky day. They're so fascinating. Why is that? Because they don't want us. You gotta respect that...
GEORGE Oh, my God! It's Susan! What do I do?
SUSAN George?
GEORGE Argh! Susan! Hi! Oh, boy! What are you doing here?!
SUSAN Renting a video! What do you got there?
GEORGE Oh, ... some stupid movie...
SUSAN This is Mona.
GEORGE Oh, hi...
MONA Pleasure to meet you.
GEORGE Yes. Well...
MONA Well, I'll let you two, uh... catch up.
SUSAN You okay?
GEORGE Yeah. Yes! I just haven't seen you in a long time.
SUSAN And you didn't expect me to be holding hands with a woman.
GEORGE Oh, please! Me? C'mon! That's great! Are you kidding? I think thats fantastic! I've always encouraged experimentation! I'm the first guy in the pool! Who do you think you're talking to?
SUSAN I know who I'm talking to.
GEORGE Of course you do... It's just, uh, y'know, I-I never knew, uh, that, uh...
SUSAN I liked women?
GEORGE There you go.
GEORGE So, uh, how long has this been going on?
SUSAN Since you and I broke up.
GEORGE Ssssso, after me, you... went that way?
SUSAN Yeah.
GEORGE Oh, I think that's fantastic. Good for you. Nice. That's very nice.
SUSAN So, what have you got there?
GEORGE Oh, I, uh--
SUSAN Oh, Rochelle, Rochelle
GEORGE It's a foreign movie... a film, is what it is, actually.
SUSAN Yeah... A lot of nudity in that, huh?
GEORGE No, no, no... Just a tiny bit... It's not even frontal nudity. It's... sidal nudity...
CLERK Next.
GEORGE Oh, that's me.
SUSAN Alright, well... Good seeing you, George.
GEORGE Yes, good to see you, too. And Good luck with, uh... with the whole thing, there.
CLERK Uh, what are you returning?
GEORGE Rochelle, Rochelle.
CLERK Ah, Rochelle, Rochelle... "A young girl's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk"...
CLERK Uh, that'll be, uh... $3.49.
GEORGE $3.49? It says $1.49.
CLERK Well, you didn't rewind it. There's a $2.00 charge for not rewinding.
GEORGE What! There's no signs here! This is an outrage!
KRAMER George, don't give him any money for that. It'll cost you less to keep it another day, rewind it and bring it back tomorrow. Don't give him the satisfaction.
GEORGE I'm not giving you the satisfaction. I'm gonna watch it again...
JERRY So, this morning I go down to the garage to check the car out. I figure by this time, the odour molecules have had at least twelve hours to de-smellify. I open the car door, like a punch in the face, the stench hits me-- it's almost as if it had gained strength throughout the night...
ELAINE Y'know I can think of at least six known offensive odours that I would rather smell than what's livin' in your car.
JERRY What about skunk?
ELAINE I don't mind skunk.
JERRY Horse manure?
ELAINE I loooove horse manure.
JERRY Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In fact, I went to the car wash, they want 250 dollars to detail it, and get the smell out. I'm not payin' for that. That's not my responsibility. In fact, I'm drivin' up to that restaurant now, and demand they pay for it.
ELAINE Absolutely.
ELAINE Listen, lemme ask you something. When you're with a guy, and he tells you he has to get up early, what does that mean?
JERRY It means he's lying.
ELAINE Wow...
JERRY Why? Is that what he told you?
ELAINE Yeah, last night. Oh, come on... Men have to get up early some time...
JERRY No. Never.
ELAINE Jerry! I'm sure I've seen men on the street early in the morning.
JERRY Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but a man will always trade sleep for sex.
ELAINE Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?
JERRY Anything's possible...
JERRY What's the matter with you?
KRAMER Steinbrenner! He's ruinin' my life...
JERRY Oh yeah, Steinbrenner...
KRAMER I don't think I can take another season with him, Jerry. He'll just trade away their best young prospects, just like he did with Beuner, McGee, Drabek... McGriff...
JERRY I know the list...
KRAMER What's that smell?
JERRY What smell?
KRAMER Ooooh... You stink.
JERRY Whatd'ya mean I stink?
KRAMER You stink. Why don't you go take a shower?
JERRY I showered! Oh, wait a second... Since I showered, I've been in the car!
ELAINE So?
JERRY Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself to me! It's alive!
ELAINE If it attached itself to you, then... Oh, my God! That's why Carl said he had to get up early! Because I stink! Jerry, he thinks I have B.O.! Me!
KRAMER What happened?
JERRY What happened? My car stinks is what happened. And it's destroying the lives of everyone in it's path.
GEORGE What is that? B.O.?
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE This is unbelievable B.O.
JERRY I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his 38 years in the business, he's never smelled anything like it.
GEORGE So, let me ask you. Do you think I could have done this?
JERRY No, no. It's the valet guy.
GEORGE No, no, I mean, driving Susan to lesbianism.
JERRY Oh... No, that's ridiculous.
GEORGE What if her experience with me drove her to it?
JERRY Suicide, maybe, not lesbianism.
GEORGE The woman she's "lesbianing" with? Susan told me she's never been with a guy.
GEORGE Oh, this isn't even B.O.! This is beyond B.O.! It's B.O.!
JERRY There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like a "Smell Gestapo". To sniff 'em out, strip 'em down, and wash them with a big, soapy brush...
GEORGE Y'know, the funny thing is, somehow I find her more appealing now... It's like if I knew she was a lesbian when we went out, I never would've broken up with her.
JERRY Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought...
JERRY Here he is... that's the guy! No, thank you, go back... go back... I'll park it! You go back!
RESTAURATEUR What do you mean-- "stunk up"?
JERRY I mean the car stinks! George, does the car stink?
GEORGE Stinks.
JERRY Stinks!
RESTAURATEUR Well, perhaps you're the one who has the odour...
JERRY Hey, I've never smelled in my life, buddy!
RESTAURATEUR Really? Well, I smell you now.
JERRY That's from the car!
RESTAURATEUR Well, maybe you're the one who stunk up the car, rather than the car stinking up you!
GEORGE Oh, it's the chicken and the egg...
JERRY Thank you very much... Well, then go out and smell the car; see which smells worse.
RESTAURATEUR I don't have time to smell cars.
GEORGE Forget about smelling the car. Smell the valet. Go to the source...
JERRY You've gotta smell the car
RESTAURATEUR I'm a busy man
JERRY C'mon! One whiff!
RESTAURATEUR Alright, one whiff...
RESTAURATEUR Alright! I give up! I admit it! It stinks! Now will you let me out!
JERRY Alright, will you pay for the cleaning?
RESTAURATEUR Yes! 50 dollars! I'll give you 50 dollars!
RESTAURATEUR I'm not paying for that. They've already got my seven dollars... "...erotic journey from Milan to Minsk"...
CARL The valet had such bad B.O.?
ELAINE Oh man, just rampant B.O., the O went from the valet's B valet's "B", to the car, to me. It clings to everything. Jerry thinks it's an entity. But I showered and I shampoo'ed, so...
CARL That's a relief...
ELAINE What?
CARL It's still there...
ELAINE No, no, no! It can't be! I shampoo'ed! I rinsed! I repeated!
GEORGE Listen, I gotta ask you: I was a little concerned that perhaps I was responsible in some way for your, uh... metamorphosis.
CLERK That'll be $98.00.
GEORGE What $98.00?
CLERK That's what I said. $98.00.
GEORGE How could that piece of crap cost $98.00!?
GEORGE So, was it me?
SUSAN Oh, don't be ridiculous! Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? Here.
GEORGE Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back.
SUSAN Yeah, sure... I gotta go.
GEORGE Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were ever to... dance, how do you decide who leads? I mean... do you take turns? Do you discuss it beforehand? How does that work?
SUSAN You're an idiot.
GEORGE Why? That's a legitimate sociological question.
SUSAN I'll see ya. And George, by the way... You stink... Real bad.
GEORGE It's not me! It's the car!
MONA I didn't think I'd come.
KRAMER I knew you would.
MONA Oh, Kramer!
CAR_WASHER We spray everything with Ozium-D, let it de-ionise, vacuum the spray out with a de-ionising machine. Hit it with high-pressure compressed air, and wet-dry vac it to extract the remaining liquids. We top it off with one of our seven air-fresheners, in your case, I would recommend the Jasmine, or the Potpourri.
JERRY Let's do it.
HAIRDRESSER The first thing we're gonna do is flush the follicles with the five essential oils. Then, we put you under a vapour machine, and then a heated cap. Then, we shampoo and shampoo and condition and condition. Then, we saturate the hair in diluted vinegar-- two parts vinegar, 10 parts water. Now, if that doesn't work, we have one last resort. Tomato sauce.
ELAINE Tomato Sauce?
JERRY Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells!
CARL It still smells.
JERRY It still smells!
GEORGE How could it still smell after all that?
JERRY I don't know!
GEORGE Well, what are you gonna do?
JERRY I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car!
GEORGE You're selling the car!?
JERRY You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force more powerful than anything you can imagine. Even Superman would be helpless against this kind of stench. And I'll take anything I can get for it.
GEORGE Maybe I'll buy it.
JERRY Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? This is not just an odour-- you need a priest to get rid of this thing!
ELAINE I still smell!
JERRY You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence! It's the beast!
SUSAN Kramer! Kramer! Kramer, open up, I know you're in there!
JERRY Susan!
SUSAN Kramer!
JERRY What is going on?
SUSAN You know what's going on? First, he vomits on me. Then, he burns down my father's cabin. And now, he's taken Mona away from me.
GEORGE He stole your girlfriend?
SUSAN Yes. She's in love with him.
GEORGE Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings 'em back.
JERRY That's the least of what you've accomplished...
ELAINE Wait a minute, wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer... Hold on a second. I don't get this. This woman has never been with a man her entire life--
KRAMER I'm Kramer.
GEORGE I know what you're going through. Women. Who knows what they want?
SUSAN I just don't know what she sees in Kramer.
GEORGE Listen. You're beautiful. You're intelligent. You'll meet other girls...
SUSAN You think so?
GEORGE Yes, I know so. You happen to be a very eligible lesbian.
SUSAN You're very sweet...
GEORGE Hey, I know what I'm talking about. I gotta be honest with you, I gotta tell ya... Ever since I saw you holding hands with that woman, I can't get you out of my mind.
SUSAN Really?
GEORGE Yeah, you're just so... hip.
GEORGE Oh, my God...
SUSAN What?
GEORGE It's Allison. I dated her right after you. She's obsessed with me.
ALLISON George?
GEORGE Allison! Hi! Oh, my God! How are you?
ALLISON Good. You know, you owe me $50...
GEORGE Right. I don't have it on me. Allison, this is Susan. Susan, Allison.
ALLISON Nice to meet you...
SUSAN Nice to meet you...
ALLISON That's a beautiful vest...
SUSAN Thank you...
KRAMER I don't understand it. I was with her last night in my apartment; it was very romantic. Y'know with that fake wood wallpaper, the atmosphere is fabulous in there, now. It's like a ski lodge.
SALESMAN What year did you say this was?
JERRY '90.
KRAMER Anyway, we were on the couch, I move to hug her, next thing she tells me she's leaving; she's got to get up early.
JERRY That's strange...
SALESMAN How many miles you got on this thing?
JERRY 23 000.
KRAMER And I was looking good, too. I had a nice, new shirt on, I'm wearing your jacket...
JERRY Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The Beast!
SALESMAN I can't sell this car.
JERRY This thing, has got to be stopped!
HAIRDRESSER So, what do you want to do?
ELAINE Sauce me.
JERRY Why do we need B.O.? What is the function of it? Everything in nature has a reason, has a purpose, except B.O. Doesn't make any sense-- do something good, hard work, exercise, smell very bad. This is the way the human being is designed. You move, you stink. Why can't our bodies help us? Why can't sweat smell good? It'd be a different world, wouldn't it? Instead of putting your laundry in the hamper, you'd put it in a vase. You'd go down to the drugstore and pick up some odourant and perspirant. You'd probably have a dirty sweat sock hanging from the rear-view mirror of your car. And then on a really special night, maybe a little underwear comin' out of your breast pocket. Just to let her know she's important.
JERRY They really got us trained to use that cash machine now, don't they? We're just like chickens in an experiment waiting for that pellet to come down the chute. You see people at the cash machine; they're just there. Just, dit dit dit dit dit dit dit, they're waiting for the sound, you know the sound, you're waiting for the sound. That's what we're trained to hear, the 'here comes the money' sound, ya know? Flip flip flip flip flip flip flip. It's exciting, don't you get excited? It's coming! It's coming! They're giving me money!
SUSAN Hey, I gotta get some cash, I'm gonna run down to the ATM.
GEORGE Yeah, I better grab some too.
SUSAN I'll get it for you; just give me your card.
GEORGE You sure?
SUSAN Yeah, just tell me your code.
GEORGE My code?
JERRY So why didn't you tell her the code?
GEORGE No. No way.
JERRY George, you're gonna marry this woman. Most likely.
GEORGE It says very clearly, 'for your protection, do not give your secret code to anyone.'
JERRY So you're taking relationship advice from Chemical Bank now?
GEORGE Why does everything have to be 'us'? Is there no 'me' left? Why can't there be some things just for me? Is that so selfish?
JERRY Actually, that's the definition of selfish.
GEORGE Have you ever given your code to anyone?
JERRY No one's ever asked. You want it? It's 'Jor-El.'
GEORGE Superman's father on Krypton.
JERRY Of course. C'mon Georgie, you wanna tell me. It's eating you up inside. Sing it, sister.
GEORGE No. I am not giving my code to anyone for any reason.
JERRY What if my life depended on it?
GEORGE If you're in some situation where some fast cash will save your life, I'll give you the code.
GEORGE What's the matter with your leg?
JERRY My foot fell asleep.
GEORGE How'd your foot fall asleep?
JERRY I crossed my legs, I forgot to alternate.
FRED Hey Jerry.
JERRY Hey Fred.
GEORGE Hey Fred.
JERRY My foot fell asleep.
FRED You're lucky, at least you got something to do.
JERRY Fred, do you know Elaine?
FRED No, it's nice to meet you. Well, I'm outta here, see you guys.
GEORGE Alright, bye.
JERRY Seeya.
ELAINE Did you hear that? He said, 'nice to meet you.'
JERRY So?
ELAINE So? We've met before. At Katie Ash's party, we talked for like ten minutes.
JERRY And he didn't remember you?
JERRY Where are you going, you just got here?
ELAINE I gotta go talk to him.
ELAINE Excuse me, excuse me, Fred?
FRED Yeah?
ELAINE You just said, 'nice to meet you', but actually we've met before.
FRED We have?
ELAINE Yeah, at Katie Ash's party?
FRED What was your name again?
ELAINE Elaine. You don't remember our conversation? I talked about how my uncle worked in the book depository building with Lee Harvey Oswald?
FRED Not ringing a bell.
ELAINE When my uncle said to him, 'the president's been shot' Oswald winked at him and said, 'I'm gonna go catch a movie'?
FRED Mmm, no.
ELAINE That was right when we were in front of the bathroom door.
FRED The bathroom door. I remember someone had played tic-tac-toe on it, and the X's won; they went diagonally from the top left to the bottom right.
JERRY Hey that sounds great, I'd love to do some TV commercials, that should really be fun.
JERRY Uh huh, okay, alright, bye. Huh, how do you like that? I'm gonna do some TV spots for Leapin' Larry's Appliance Store. That was Leapin' Larry himself, I'm gonna meet with him tomorrow.
KRAMER Leapin' Larry! Yeah, that's where I bought this.
JERRY What is that?
KRAMER Well, it's an emergency band scanner, it picks up everything: Fires, harbor patrol, even the police. I'm watching the watchers, Jerry. Uh oh, we got a big fire on 115th. I tell ya if could do it over again, I'd give it all up to be a fireman.
JERRY Yeah, those civil servants who risk their lives really got it made.
KRAMER When I was a kid, all I ever dreamed of was steering the back of that big hook and ladder.
JERRY You're lucky they let you drive a car.
KRAMER No no no, they're talking the West Side Highway, at this time of day that's insane. They're heading straight into gridlock. Oh, those fools.
ELAINE What was that?
JERRY Eh.
ELAINE Alright. So, get a load of this. This guy, Fred Yerkes, remembers every little thing about that night except me.
JERRY Really? I'm surprised, he doesn't meet that many women.
ELAINE What are you saying?
JERRY Well, what's to be said? He didn't remember you.
ELAINE Yeah, but why? I mean, ya know.
JERRY I know.
ELAINE Ya know?
JERRY Yeah, I know.
ELAINE Huh, lookit, you got the new catalog.
JERRY Yeah, you wrote a good piece on the Himalayan Walking Shoe.
ELAINE Too good. Peterman was so pleased, now he wants to take me out to dinner tomorrow. Maybe you wanna come with me.
JERRY Why would I wanna do that?
ELAINE Oh please, Jerry, please please please, I can't sit with him, he tells these stories, it's gonna be awful.
JERRY Yeah, sounds like fun.
SUSAN I want you to tell me, George.
GEORGE Why? Why is my code so important?
SUSAN Because, it's part of our relationship, it's an indication of trust. We're not supposed to keep secrets from one another.
GEORGE Well I'm sure you have secrets from me. I don't know anything about your cycles.
SUSAN My cycles?
GEORGE Yeah, I never know what's going on there.
SUSAN Well from now on I'll keep you apprised of my cycles.
GEORGE Please.
SUSAN Anything else?
GEORGE We're out of Bosco!
JERRY Howbout this, come one down to Leapin' Parry's if you can beat our prices, we'll give you the store.
LEAPIN'_LARRY Ya know I've always liked your comedy, you don't take cheap shots.
JERRY No I don't.
LEAPIN'_LARRY Sorry for keeping you here so long. Again, I apologize for the mess. This renovation is killing me.
JERRY My foot's asleep again!
LEAPIN'_LARRY When I lost my leg in the boating accident, I got so depressed about this damn prosthetic I thought I was gonna have to give up the business. But now I'm rejuvenated. Let me show you around the store.
JERRY You know what? I'll be with you in a minute.
EMPLOYEE That is a great impression!
JERRY Larry, wait, you don't understand!
KRAMER I just came from Leapin' Larry's. Making fun of crippled people, is that what you've sunk to?
JERRY I didn't do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep.
KRAMER Oh, oh your foot fell asleep.
JERRY Ya know, the guy has one leg and he still calls himself Leapin' Larry, you'd think he had a sense of humor about it.
KRAMER Well, you just joked yourself right out of that commercial, didn't you, munjamba?
JERRY Yup.
KRAMER Boy, look at that. Se that's that fire I was listening to yesterday.
JERRY Wow, the whole building burned down.
KRAMER They just don't know what street to take. You remember that time I got us to Yankee Stadium in rush hour in fifteen minutes?
JERRY Of course.
KRAMER It's all up here, Jerry. All up here. It's innate.
JERRY The amazing thing is you never have any place to go.
GEORGE Where we gonna eat?
JERRY We're gonna meet Elaine and Peterman at the Chinese place.
GEORGE Peterman? Nobody mentioned anything about Peterman.
JERRY Of course not, if I did would you have gone?
GEORGE No way.
JERRY There you go.
GEORGE I don't even know Peterman. How the hell am I gonna relax? I'm gonna have to be on all night. I don't like being on, Jerry, I would much rather be off.
JERRY Trust me, you're off.
ELAINE Oh, hi Fred.
FRED Um, hello?
ELAINE It's Elaine.
FRED Oh yeah, yeah, right.
ELAINE How ya doin'?
FRED I'm depressed. I got this new shirt, the button fell off. Once the button falls off, that's it. I'll never fix it.
ELAINE Yeah, that's too bad.
FRED Yeah, I'm gonna get some vitamins, I feel depleted.
ELAINE Hmm. I never take them.
FRED Cause they make you nauseous, right?
ELAINE Yeah! Yeah, that's right, you remembered!
FRED Do you wanna have dinner tonight?
ELAINE Hmm. Tonight.
FRED What, you have other plans?
ELAINE No, no no no, none that I can, um, remember.
JERRY ...Alright, you're locked up in a prison in Turkey, I have your wallet. The only way I can bribe the guards to get you out is for you to give me your ATM code.
GEORGE Call the Embassy.
JERRY They're closed.
GEORGE Why?
JERRY Bomb threat.
GEORGE We're in Turkey?
JERRY Midnight Express, my friend.
GEORGE My card won't work there; they're not on the Plus system.
PETERMAN You must be Jerry Seinfeld.
JERRY Yes, hi, Mr. Peterman. This is, uh, George Costanza.
PETERMAN J. Peterman.
GEORGE J. Crew.
JERRY Well, is Elaine here?
PETERMAN Oh, Elaine just called, she won't be joining us. Not to worry, I'll tell the maitre'd it'll just be the three bulls.
GEORGE What's going on? He still wants to have dinner with us?
JERRY Without Elaine? What for?
GEORGE What, is he crazy?
JERRY We gotta get out of here. Come on; weave your web, liar man.
GEORGE I've got nothing, I-I-I-I'm blank.
JERRY George, what's the matter with you?
GEORGE I'm choking!
PETERMAN Ah, Fong has been most accommodating. Shall we?
JERRY Actually, you know I just remembered I promised this comedy club that I'd do a set tonight, so, terribly sorry.
PETERMAN I understand, no hard feelings. George and I will miss your company. Fong? It will just be two this evening. George, we dine.
ELAINE I can't believe this, is this guy standing me up?
PETERMAN ...And there, tucked into the river's bend was the object of my search. The Gwon-Jaya River market, fabrics and spices traded under a starlit sky. It was there that I discovered the Pamplona beret. Sizes seven-and-a-half through eight-and-three-quarters. Price? Thirty-five dollars.
GEORGE Howbout sports? Do you follow sports?
TV_ANNOUNCER It's fourth and inches and the Giants are going for it! You gotta love sports!
GEORGE You know, this is very nice, but I really could take a cab. Really.
PETERMAN Ha ha, nonsense, George. Besides it gives me a chance to tell you about my latest trip to Burma where I discovered a very unusual corduroy.
PETERMAN Peterman here. What? Oh no. Alright, I'll be right there. It's my mother; she's at death's door. I just pray to God we can make it there in time.
JERRY I can't believe you blew us off; we were doing you the favor.
ELAINE Well, Fred asked me out.
JERRY Fred?
ELAINE Yeah, and then he stood me up. I don't get this guy.
JERRY You see what's going on here? You're attracted to him because he can't remember anything about you.
ELAINE I am? But that's so sick.
JERRY That's God's plan. He doesn't really want anyone to get together.
ELAINE Anyway, so how was the dinner?
JERRY Well, when I heard you weren't coming I made up and excuse and got the hell out of there.
ELAINE What about Georgie?
JERRY Nah, he didn't make it.
PETERMAN Doctor, how is she?
DOCTOR She's too weak to talk but she'll be happy to hear your voice.
PETERMAN Mama, it's me. Jacopo. I'm here for you, mama.
GEORGE I'm, uh, George Costanza. I was having dinner with your son.
PETERMAN Shake off the dew, my friend.
GEORGE Yeah. What time is it?
PETERMAN It's morning. Thanks for seeing me through the night. I'll make us a pot of coffee, George. Watch her, won't you?
GEORGE Who?
PETERMAN Momma. Just talk to her, George. The doctor seems to think it helps.
GEORGE Hi. I-I really should be getting back to my fianc�, you know, we, uh, we had this big fight yesterday and, uh, well she, she wants to-to know my secret code. I-I don't know, I can't tell her. The funny thing is, you know, I would really love to tell someone 'cause it's killing me. You uh, you wanna know what it is? It's Bosco. You know, the chocolate syrup? I love that stuff, I pour it in milk, it's my favorite drink. Hoo-hoo, boy, that is a relief!
MRS._PETERMAN Bosco. Bosco.
GEORGE Oh, shhh.
MRS._PETERMAN Bosco!
PETERMAN Momma?
GEORGE Quiet, quiet! It's a secret.
MRS._PETERMAN Bosco! Bosco! Bosco!
GEORGE Shut up! Shut up!
PETERMAN Momma! What are you trying to say?
MRS._PETERMAN Bosco.
PETERMAN She's gone. Bosco?
GEORGE You know this whole thing never would have happened if you hadn't bailed out on me at the restaurant.
JERRY I did not bail out on you.
GEORGE Well why couldn't you include me in your excuse?
JERRY Why didn't you come up with your own?
GEORGE I froze. I think I'm losing it.
JERRY Ah, c'mon. Maybe you're just in a slump?
GEORGE No, no. I reached down and there was nothing there.
GEORGE Now Peterman wants me to go to the funeral.
JERRY Oh, come on, just tell me your code already. What is it?
GEORGE I am not giving you my code.
KRAMER I'll bet I can guess it.
GEORGE Pssh. Yeah. Right.
KRAMER Oh, alright. Yeah. Uh, let's see. Um, well, we can throw out birthdays immediately. That's too obvious. And no numbers for you, you're a word man. Alright, let's go deeper. Uh, what kind of man are you? Well, you're weak, spineless, a man of temptations, but what tempts you?
GEORGE Huh?
KRAMER You're a portly fellow, a bit long in the waistband. So what's your pleasure? Is it the salty snacks you crave? No no no no no, yours is a sweet tooth.
GEORGE Get out of here.
KRAMER Oh you may stray, but you'll always return to your dark master, the cocoa bean.
GEORGE I'm leaving.
KRAMER No, and only the purest syrup nectar can satisfy you!
GEORGE I gotta go.
KRAMER If you could you'd guzzle it by the gallon! Ovaltine! Hershey's!
GEORGE Shut up!
KRAMER Nestle Quick!
GEORGE Shut up!
GEORGE What was that?
ELAINE What?
GEORGE You just checked your watch. Are you thinking of bailing on him?
ELAINE I got a date.
ELAINE Oh, Mr. Peterman.
PETERMAN Oh, Elaine. George, when momma said 'Bosco' she must have been trying to communicate something, a legacy, a dying wish perhaps.
GEORGE Mothers say things. My mother goes babbling on and on like a crazy person.
ELAINE Mr. Peterman, you have my deepest sympathies. Unfortunately, I've gotta get going.
PETERMAN You do?
GEORGE Uh, yes, actually we-we both do.
ELAINE I have a personal commitment.
GEORGE Well, personal, I mean, we both uh...
PETERMAN What is it?
ELAINE I'm speaking at a women's' rights conference.
GEORGE Yes, and I'm speaking at a men's' conference.
PETERMAN I don't believe that for a minute. Well, Elaine, it was good of you to stop by.
ELAINE My pleasure.
PETERMAN Fortunately, I still have George here to help me through this.
PETERMAN You know George, growing up as a boy in Costa Rica, I heard a rumor that momma had taken a lover. Perhaps Bosco was this man's name.
KRAMER Hey, you wanna come down the fire station with me?
JERRY Fire station?
KRAMER Yeah, I made a map of my shortcuts. I'm gonna rock their world!
JERRY Nah, I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's.
KRAMER Oh, so he took you back.
JERRY Yeah, we straightened it out, all is forgiven.
KRAMER Well, you know the important thing is that you learned something.
JERRY No I didn't.
CAPTAIN Well, Mr. Kramer, your list of short cuts is most impressive.
KRAMER Yeah, and this is just the Upper West Side. Wait until I get to the Village, then you're gonna see a magic show.
CAPTAIN Mr. Kramer, just about every week some brash young hothead like yourself saunters in here talking about faster routes and snazzier colors for the trucks, well, fact is we feel things are fine the way they are.
JERRY Anyway, thanks for having me back, and sorry about the misunderstanding.
LEAPIN'_LARRY Water under the bridge. Come on, I never did get a chance to show you around the store.
JERRY Oh sure.
JERRY Uh, again? I'll be right there.
DISPATCHER Attention Company 390, structure fire at Leapin' Larry's Appliance Warehouse.
KRAMER Leapin' Larry's? Hey, that's uptown. You gotta take Amsterdam.
CAPTAIN Stay out of this, Kramer.
KRAMER Are you ok, cowboy? Where do you need to go?
FIREMAN I drive the back of the truck. Kramer's face lights up.
KRAMER Well, you'd better take it easy.
FRED Sorry about the other night but my mother called, she couldn't find her pills. I had to go into Brooklyn to help her find her pills, and they were right there in the medicine cabinet. Could you believe that?
ELAINE Huh.
FRED The worst part is getting from the subway station to the house. There's no transportation...
ELAINE What am I doing? I'm on a date with this guy because he didn't remember me? He's demented, listen to him...
FRED ...I could have taken a cab but if my mother saw me pull up in a cab, she'd start yelling at me, "Freddy! What are taking a cab for? It's so expensive!" She's out of her mind. Eventually, you'll meet her.
PETERMAN Bosco. Bosco. Bosco. There's a big fire down the street, the whole block is going up in flames!
PETERMAN George!
CAPTAIN Gonna make a left onto Broadway.
KRAMER No, I would advise against that.
CAPTAIN Who is this?
KRAMER It's Kramer!
CAPTAIN Kramer?! What the hell are you doing back there?
KRAMER DeSoto's down, but Cosmo's got the caboose.
WOMAN How did this start?
JERRY Beats me.
LEAPIN'_LARRY Where the hell's the fire department? I'm gonna lose the whole store!
CAPTAIN Kramer, get the hell off of there. You're not trained to operate this equipment!
MAN_ON_THE_STREET Hey, Kramer!
KRAMER Hey!
LEAPIN'_LARRY Try the scanner, see if you can pick up anything.
CAPTAIN What are you doing, Kramer?! You're all over the road!
KRAMER Don't worry, Cap, I can handle it!
JERRY Kramer?
CAPTAIN You're losing control! Hard right! Hard right!
JERRY Ah, that's a shame.
PETERMAN The fire will eat up this entire block!
PETERMAN Look, there's a man in there. Get out of there, you're in danger!
MAN But my sleeve, it's stuck in the machine, it ate my card!
PETERMAN George, give me your ATM card!
GEORGE I don't have my ATM card.
PETERMAN George, you're obviously lying, anyone can see that!
PETERMAN It's jammed! I'll slide it under the door,
MAN Now give me your code!
GEORGE What?! Why?
MAN The machine won't open without the code!
PETERMAN George, give him your code!
GEORGE But I-I-I-
PETERMAN George, there's no time! Tell him your code! Shout out your code, man!!
MAN The code!! The code!!
SUSAN Hi. Here's your cash, George.
GEORGE Hm. Thanks.
SUSAN And here's your card back. Anyone for Bosco?
JERRY Oh my god. Look at this.
GEORGE Hm?
PERRY It's the new J. Peterman catalog. Look.
GEORGE The Rogue's Wallet. That's where he kept his card, his dirty little secret. Short, devious, balding. his name was Costanza. He killed my mother.
JERRY So I was in the drug store the other day, trying to get a cold medication. You ever try and pick one of these out? It's not easy. It's a wall. It's an entire wall of cold medication, you stand there, you're going, "Alright, alright, alright, okay, what the hell-- This is quick acting, but this is long lasting. When do I need to feel good, now or later?" It's a tough question. And they always show you the commercials on TV where they show you what's wrong with the guy, you know? They always show you, like, all the problems that he's having. First of all, the always show you the human body, which is usually this guy. No face, mouth open, this is how drug companies see the public. And he's always in, like, a certain pain, it's like red wavy lines are going through him or he's glowing, parts of him are on fire sometimes, lightning is attacking him. I never had a doctor say to me, "Are you having any pain?" "Yes I am." "Are you having any lightning with the pain?"
JERRY How did you get fleas?
GEORGE Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they got in his carpet.
JERRY Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar.
GEORGE That's not funny. So, are you coming to the party?
JERRY I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation. The whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, "You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?"
GEORGE You know Ava's gonna be there.
JERRY Who?
GEORGE The nice one that works in my office.
JERRY Nah.
GEORGE I'll drive.
JERRY Oh, well, now you're talking.
GEORGE It's supposed to be a good party.
JERRY What does that mean, good dip?
GEORGE No, there'll be girls there.
JERRY There's girls everywhere. I go out of my apartment, there's girls in the elevator. They're in cafeterias, subways, so what?
GEORGE There's a hundred different things here. What's the difference between these two? You got propylparabin?
JERRY Got it.
GEORGE You got isobutane-30?
JERRY I got isobutane-20.
GEORGE A-ha.
JERRY You got sorbitant sesquioliate?
GEORGE Got it.
JERRY I have aloe!
GEORGE You got aloe? I love aloe.
JERRY Where do they make yours?
GEORGE Jersey.
JERRY White Plains.
JERRY Girls. There's girls right here in the store. Look, look, there's one over there. Look, there's another one. Soon as I walk outside there'll be girls out there. What's the matter?
GEORGE I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten.
JERRY Are you sure? Oh boy, here we go.
GEORGE Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you only actually gave me change for a ten.
CASHIER You gave me a ten.
GEORGE I'm positive I gave you a twenty.
CASHIER I know what you gave me.
GEORGE You owe me ten dollars.
CASHIER Will you please step aside? Next?
GEORGE Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second. Who, in this situation, would be more likely to make a mistake? Me, who had access to my wallet, knew exactly what was in there? Or you--
CASHIER You.
GEORGE No, no, no, see you're not really listening.
SECURITY_GUARD What's the problem here?
GEORGE No problem. There's no problem. She just owes me ten dollars, that's all.
CASHIER He's claiming short.
SECURITY_GUARD Alright, let's just take it outside.
GEORGE Oh, so you don't believe me either?
SECURITY_GUARD Come on, let's go.
GEORGE You haven't won. You may think you've won, but you haven't won. Do you know why? It's not over. This is not over. I'm not forgetting what's happening here. You have my ten dollars. I will get it back. Alright, don't worry. It's not over. I'm going now. Good bye. I will be back.
ELAINE Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in.
JERRY No, let's survey first. Camp here.
GEORGE Ava.
JERRY What could possess anyone to throw a party? I mean, to have a bunch of strangers treat your house like a hotel room.
AVA So, guess who just sold 129 West 81st.
GEORGE Oh no you didn't. Get out, when?
AVA Yesterday
GEORGE I don't believe it.
AVA Ask Mark.
GEORGE Mark, is this true?
JERRY Yeah, this has got disaster written all over it.
ELAINE How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my mind.
JERRY Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight. In case one of us gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're in trouble so the other one can get us out of it.
ELAINE How old are you?
JERRY Thirty-six. What's the signal? Howbout this? Chicken wing? No, no, no, I got a better one. Head patting.
ELAINE Whatever you want.
GUY You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?
JERRY Yeah, yeah I did.
GUY So what do you do?
JERRY I'm a comedian.
GUY Are you? Lemme ask you something. Where do you get your material?
JERRY I hear a voice.
GUY What kind of voice?
JERRY A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator.
GUY How come you keep tapping your head.
JERRY It's a nervous tic. I'm on L-Dopa.
GUY On the other hand, you take a guy like George Washington Carver. The man devoted his whole life to the peanut. Imagine having so much passion for something.
GUY Ya know, people tell me I'm a funny guy.
GUY I've often wondered if he ever worked with the pecan.
ELAINE Yeah, me too.
GUY Now is that considered a nut, because I know the cashew is a legume.
GEORGE How's it going?
JERRY Great, how about you?
GEORGE I can't believe what's happening here. She hasn't taken her hands off me all night. She was always friendly around the office, but that was it.
JERRY How do you account for this?
GEORGE I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head.
JERRY Well, she obviously liked you all along.
GEORGE No, I would have picked up on it. I can always tell when a woman likes me, they always somehow let you know. With me, they could torture me, I wouldn't tell them. If anything I'd try to make them think I don't like them, then they think, "Oh, look at this guy, he's not even looking at me, he must have something going for him."
JERRY Anyway, I'm ready to go.
GEORGE Now?
JERRY If not now, when?
GEORGE Gimme a half-hour.
JERRY Okay, half-hour.
GUY Peanut brittle, peanut butter, peanut oil...
JERRY Can I talk to you for a second?
ELAINE Oh, excuse me. What have you been doing, I've been smacking myself senseless. People think I'm a mental patient.
JERRY Hey, I was dying over there.
ELAINE This guy's going off on the peanut. Now pay attention.
ELLEN Yeah, I think I've seen you in a club. You talk about a lot of every day things, right?
JERRY Right.
ELLEN Yeah, I remember you.
WOMAN I wonder what happened to my fiance. I know he's here somewhere. Ellen? Have you seen my fiance?
ELLEN He's upstairs.
WOMAN Are you going upstairs? Tell my fiance I'm looking for him. I have lost my fiance, the poor baby.
ELAINE Maybe the dingo ate your baby.
WOMAN What?
ELAINE The dingo ate your baby!
JERRY You ready?
GEORGE Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask.
JERRY I do favors.
GEORGE I think something's happening here.
JERRY What?
GEORGE I think she wants me to take her home.
JERRY Wow.
GEORGE What should I do?
JERRY Go! What could you do?
GEORGE What about you and Elaine?
JERRY We'll get a ride.
GEORGE Are you sure?
JERRY We'll be fine, what did she say?
GEORGE She told me she wants-- She told me she wants me to make love to her.
JERRY What? She said that?
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY Get out of here.
GEORGE I swear.
JERRY What did you say?
GEORGE I, I, I can't.
JERRY What did you say?
GEORGE Please, it's--
JERRY What?
GEORGE I... I... I long for you.
JERRY I long for you?
GEORGE I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.
JERRY It's okay, that's not bad.
GEORGE I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating. The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.
JERRY Really?
GEORGE That's a lot of pressure. Make love to me. What am I, in the circus? What if I can't deliver?
JERRY Oh, come on.
GEORGE I can't perform under pressure. That's why I never play anything for money, I choke. I could choke tonight. And she works in my office, can you imagine? She goes around telling everyone what happened? Maybe I should cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.
JERRY George, you're thinking too much.
GEORGE I know, I know, I can't stop it!
ELAINE Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.
JERRY Pendant? Those bastards.
ELAINE Excuse me.
JERRY Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office
ELAINE Really? Huh. What a world. So we can go now?
JERRY Uh, no, he's taking the car.
ELAINE Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?
JERRY I don't know.
ELAINE You don't know?
JERRY Maybe Kramer can come pick us up.
ELAINE Oh great, oh, this is great. How could you let him take the car?
JERRY There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code.
JERRY All plans between men are tentative. If one man should suddenly have an opportunity to pursue a woman, it's like these two guys never met each other ever in life. This is the male code. And it doesn't matter how important the arrangements are, I mean, most of the time when they scrub a space shuttle mission it's because one of the astronauts met someone on his way to the launch pad. They hold that countdown. He's leaning against the rocket talking to her, "So listen, when I get back what do you say we get together for some Tang?"
ELAINE Oh look at that. Look at what she's wearing. You see what she's wearing?
JERRY Yeah, yeah, alright.
ELAINE I can't believe she's walking around in that.
JERRY Just don't make a scene.
ELAINE Hey, is that real fur?
JERRY Oh boy.
AVA It better be or my ex-husband owes me an explanation.
GEORGE Yeah, good night.
ELAINE You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are being tortured so that you can look good?
GEORGE Could we talk about this some other time?
AVA Are you a vegetarian?
JERRY Here we go.
ELAINE Yeah, I eat fish occasionally.
AVA So you're a hypocrite.
GEORGE Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect. Anyway-
AVA Well, talk to me when you stop eating fish.
ELAINE Fish don't feel any pain.
AVA How do you know? Do you communicate with fish?
ELAINE Well, they're not kept in little cages.
AVA Ever seen a goldfish?
GEORGE Goldfish.
ELAINE Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish. They're not unhappy.
AVA Oh yeah, right. Swim around in a bowl for two weeks and get flushed down the toilet, that's a good life. Let's go.
ELAINE Oh yeah, that's right. Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a squirrel!
GEORGE That's why we're here in America.
JERRY You're beautiful.
ELAINE Call Kramer.
JERRY Alright. Excuse me, this is your party, right?
STEVE No, I just live here.
JERRY Can I use your phone?
STEVE What's in it for me?
JERRY A bigger bill?
STEVE He he, go for it. Jerry picks up the phone and dials.
JERRY Krame? Sein. What are you doing? Well, I'm stuck out here on Long Island. What are your thoughts about taking a ride? You sure? Okay, but don't leave me hanging here. Okay, great. Let me give you directions.
ELAINE You sure you don't need any help?
JENNY No, not really.
JERRY I'm sure he'll be here any minute.
JENNY I want them out of here.
ELAINE Call him again.
JERRY I called, what should I do? We really appreciate this.
JENNY It's two o'clock in the morning.
JERRY Oh, you got the Civil War book. I saw some of that show, it was wonderful.
ELAINE Six hundred and twenty million people died.
JERRY Thousand.
ELAINE Thousand. Six hundred and twenty thousand. The horror, the horror. The wife keeps giving us dirty looks. Are you sure you gave him the right directions?
JERRY Yes. You're sure there's nothing we can do?
JENNY No! I am not going to bed with them in out house, this is ridiculous.
JERRY You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here. Mike Wichter. He sold plastic straws. You know the ones? You could bend them.
ELAINE Have you noticed, people don't use straws as much as they used to for some reason.
JENNY You know, it doesn't look as if your friend is coming.
JERRY Oh, he's coming.
JENNY Maybe you should take a look at a train schedule.
JERRY That's him.
JENNY I'm going to bed!
ELAINE Thanks a lot.
JERRY Thanks, great party.
KRAMER Hey, how ya doing?
STEVE Ah, look who's here.
KRAMER I'm sorry.
JERRY Hey, it's okay.
KRAMER I had the directions on the seat right next to me, they flew out the window.
ELAINE Then how did you find the place?
KRAMER Well I knew the exit on the Long Island Expressway, and I thought that the address was 8713 Riviera Drive. Uh uh, so I drove around knocking on everybody's doors that had those numbers; 8317, 7813, 3718, 1837, whoo. Finally, I hit it. 8173.
JERRY Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve, I really owe you one.
STEVE No problem.
JERRY And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy club, whatever.
STEVE Hey, I might take you up on that.
JERRY Here's my address and number. And really, thanks again.
KRAMER You better zip up. I couldn't get the top on the convertible up.
ELAINE But it's cold out.
KRAMER Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway.
JERRY George, I've been sick all week. Elaine was too. Eighty miles an hour, forty degree temperature for fifty minutes. Do the math. Yeah, maybe I will get out. Hey, let me just stop off at the drug store first. Okay, meet me down there in fifteen minutes then we'll go do something. Yeah, Selwyn's. Okay bye.
JERRY Who is it?
VOICE Mr. Pocatello.
JERRY Who?
VOICE You mean you don't recognize my voice?
STEVE Jerry, baby!
JERRY Do I know you?
STEVE Boy this comedy's really frying your brain.
JERRY I'm sorry, uh-
STEVE See, this is the kind of lasting impression I make on people.
JERRY Oh, okay.
STEVE You said if I was ever in the city, I'm in the city.
JERRY You certainly are. What's going on?
STEVE I'm just waiting for a lift back to the island, he won't be ready until eleven, so I figured I'd give you a break. I thought I'd see what it was like to hang out with someone in show business.
JERRY Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend.
STEVE Oh, come on, you can come up with something better than that.
JERRY No, really, I just got off the phone with him.
STEVE I understand.
JERRY Look, you can hang out here if you want.
STEVE Don't be so enthusiastic.
JERRY No, it's-
STEVE I'm not gonna steal anything.
JERRY No, of course not, just close the door when you leave.
STEVE I think I can do that.
JERRY Really, I'm sorry. Maybe another time.
STEVE Yeah. Let's have lunch.
JERRY They guy's in my house right now. What a mistake that party was, I never should have gone.
GEORGE Yeah, me either.
JERRY Oh, come on.
GEORGE What come on? Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office?
JERRY I've never had a job.
GEORGE You know the anxiety you feel on a date? That's what I have every day now. My worst nightmare's come true, every day is a date.
JERRY That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?
GEORGE Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a friend. Now we sleep together and suddenly, I don't know how to talk to her. Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk. I have to plan little patter. I spend half my day writing. Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze how it went. If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day. I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me. I want to go back there again.'
JERRY What are you gonna do?
GEORGE I have no choice, I'm quitting.
KRAMER The party, Long Island?
STEVE Kramer, right?
KRAMER Hey, what are you doing here?
STEVE I'm waiting for my ride.
KRAMER Where's Jerry?
STEVE He split. Let me ask you something. Is there anything to drink in here or is that, like, a stupid question?
KRAMER Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything. Well, but I might have something.
JERRY Alright, I'm gonna get this. This looks good.
GEORGE How much is that?
JERRY Nine sixty.
GEORGE Nine sixty? Give it to me.
JERRY Why?
GEORGE Don't worry, I got it.
JERRY What do you mean, you got it?
GEORGE I got it.
JERRY Since when are you treating me to medicine? What are you doing? You're stealing this, aren't you?
GEORGE I'm not stealing it. They owe me ten dollars. They stole from me.
JERRY You're a lunatic.
GEORGE I have to do this, it's a matter of honor.
JERRY What do you say to a person like you?
GEORGE Just walk.
JERRY Oh.
SECURITY_GUARD Scuse me. What do you got there?
GEORGE What?
SECURITY_GUARD What do you got in your shirt?
GEORGE Oh, I was gonna pay for this.
SECURITY_GUARD Come with me.
GEORGE Where are you taking me? I was gonna pay for it.
CASHIER um-hmm.
SECURITY_GUARD You don't think I remember you?
GEORGE What are you talking about?
SECURITY_GUARD I know who you are, I was watching you.
GEORGE What are you gonna do? Are you gonna call the police?
JERRY Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?
KRAMER So, I'm chasing these doves down the street and she's screaming at the top of her lungs, and then when the magician comes back from Europe, two of them turned brown! Well I followed the instructions!
STEVE Ah, they turned brown!! Brown!! So let me ask you something, you know any women we could call?
KRAMER Not really.
STEVE Maybe we should call one of those escort services. I saw one of them advertised before on the cable station.
STEVE Hey, you want in on this?
KRAMER No, I got a girl in the next building
VOICE Now I want my money, mister, and I ain't leaving until I get it. Now I am through playing games with you, I got things to do.
STEVE Oh Jerry! Jerry! Look who's here, it's Jerry
JERRY What the hell?
STEVE Jerry, this is Patti.
JERRY Nice to meet you.
PATTI It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, I'm sure.
JERRY What the hell is going on here?
STEVE I don't know, but I gotta do this more often. Ooh, there's my ride, finally.
PATTI I'm not gonna go anywhere until I get the rest of my money.
STEVE See ya, Jerr. And tell Kramer thanks and I'll call him tomorrow.
JERRY Oh, Kramer huh?
STEVE Yeah, he's a hoot. Oh, goodbye, my dear. Ouch. Weekend of the 26th, come on out, we're having another party.
PATTI I ain't leaving.
JERRY Patti?
PATTI You got anything to drink?
JERRY Alright, how much does he owe you?
PATTI Fifty dollars.
JERRY Fifty dollars.
COP This your apartment?
JERRY Yeah, but--
COP You're under arrest for solicitation of prostitution.
JERRY Wait a second, I--
ELAINE I brought you chicken soup. Is that real fur?
JERRY Oh boy.
GEORGE You had Sgt. Chadway? Me too.
JERRY He was a nice guy.
GEORGE Oh, great guy.
JERRY Was there a red-headed guy there?
GEORGE The one with the long sideburns?
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE Where does he come off?
JERRY Yeah, I know. There's no call for that kind of attitude.
GEORGE One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.
JERRY Oh, we all hated him.
JERRY There's two types of favors, the big favor and the small favor. You can measure the size of the favor by the pause that a person takes after they ask you to 'do me a favor.' Small favor, small pause. Can you do me a favor, hand me that pencil? No pause at all. Big favors are, 'Could you do me a favor...'
JERRY They call themselves exterminators but they can't really do it. The best they can do is get the bugs to somebody else's house. They just relocate them , y'know what I mean, they're bug realtors is what they are. Ahmmmm.. I'll think you'll be happy here , there's a lotta crumbs not much light, ahmmm they usually sleep through the night, so you'll really have a of the place. Nobody really cares about killing insects, even the animal rights people don't care. You could probably walk into an animal rights organization meeting and hear a speech like; The only way to stop the cruelty of the scientific testing on animals is ...Ha! Got him , is to boycott these companies.
GEORGE Jerry it's funny, Paula and I actually met because of Elaine.
PAULA Elaine is in my drawing class at the new school
GEORGE ..And I went down there one time to see...
JERRY A nude model.
GEORGE If Elaine wanted to get some coffee.
JERRY You know I went out once with a nude model. Never let me see her naked. Hundreds of people see her naked every week, except me. Needless to say it was quite vexing.
GEORGE Are you through?
JERRY Yeah!
GEORGE So Anyway, I started to compliment Elaine on her sketches and it turns out,they're Paula's.
PAULA George, I just like to doodle
GEORGE Oh! Dropped a napkin... Jerry!
JERRY What?
GEORGE What are you doing?...She had those nuts in her mouth , she just spit them out.
JERRY OooH!!! You. you ate these? You sucked on these and put them on the plate?
SHELLY Well I didn't know you were gonna eat them?
JERRY Soo...
SHELLY I'm sorry you find me so repulsive?
JERRY No ,no I don't, I mean, Don't be silly..
SHELLY Yeah!
JERRY It's just...
SHELLY Well, hem ,if you'll excuse me I think I'll just go to the ladies room.
PAULA I'll join you.
JERRY Oh! man did you see that. I ate discarded food.
GEORGE Well I've done that.
JERRY Yeah, but with you it's intentional.
GEORGE Haven't you kissed her?
JERRY Yeah, but this is different , this is like ,you know, semi digested food stuff. You know the next stop is the stomach and you can take it from there.
GEORGE Excuse me just for a second.
JERRY Ah. Yes that's gonna make a big difference.
GEORGE This is dating , you can't leave anything to chance.
JERRY Hey ,You think that Shelly's upset that I made such a big deal about the pecan.
GEORGE Hehummm , Yeah!
JERRY Thanks.
GEORGE No problem.
SHELLY Well Jerry , I guess we should get going.
JERRY Ah! boy.
GEORGE Well , it was very nice meeting you Shelly and Jerry be careful ,there's a lot of nuts out there. All right you have everything?
PAULA Can you grab my purse.
GEORGE Yeah. Hello!
ELAINE What is with him?
JERRY the usual
ELAINE So, you know what? My friend Judy recommended me for a job at Viking Press.
JERRY Good for you
ELAINE Yeah! But get this. Viking has a deal with the Plaza Hotel, they got a two bedroom suite, there , for out-of-town clients...So guess what I did?
JERRY Oh! Come on, you told them you're from out-of-town just so you could stay in a hotel room.
ELAINE I know, I know Jerry.. but it's The Plazaaa... I've never stayed there .It'll be like a little vacation
JERRY Well be sure to catch a Broadway show while you're in town.

GEORGE But she's gonna know that I like her more than she likes me.
JERRY You know my parents are coming in and I got some clean up to do , so if you and Potsie are done scheming....
KRAMER Well, they're in...
JERRY What's in?
KRAMER The Macanaw Peaches ,Jerry , the Macanaw Peaches!
JERRY Aah! .. right. The ones from Oregon that are only ripe for two weeks a year..
KRAMER Yeah Yeah I split a case with Newman..I waited all year for this.. Oooh this is fantastic.. Makes your taste buds come alive....It's like having a circus in your mouth.....Take a taste
JERRY Nah, I don't wanna
KRAMER Come on ,Just take a taste
JERRY I don't want it..
KRAMER Come on just taste!
JERRY I don't want it
KRAMER He..Ya. aya. Ayyaaaa!
JERRY I am not gonna taste your peach. I ate some one's pecan last night, I'm not gonna eat your peach.
KRAMER Jerry , this is a miracle of nature that exists for a brief period. It's like the Aurora Borealis.
JERRY ..What is this?
KRAMER What?
JERRY Yeah! I think I got flea bites.
KRAMER Flea bites?
JERRY Look at this, my ankle's all bitten up.
KRAMER You got a dog?
JERRY No.
KRAMER Well, that is strange.

MORTY Hey guys . Jerry . Kramer
HELEN Hi Jerry......What's wrong?

PAULA He said that?
ELAINE Ha hum...Do you like George?
PAULA Yeaaah! he's cool.

PAULA Like like.. looks aren't important to me ,you know?
TEACHER Miss Benes , Are you chewing gum?
ELAINE HumHummmm....
KARL Yep!...In your bedroom too Mr. Seinfeld. You've got a full outbreak of fleas on your hands.
JERRY I don't get this. How did this happen. I don't have a dog.
KARL I don't explain 'em Mr. Seinfeld. I just exterminate them.
JERRY I don't understand this..
KARL I 'm gonna have to seal the place up for 48 hours and fog it. That's the only way to get rid of them.
JERRY Nobody can be in here for 48 hours, I got my parents in town.
KARL Well , unless you want to kill them. They can't stay in here. This stuff is pretty toxic. I'll go get my stuff, it's in the truck.
JERRY Okay..
ELAINE Hi....???
JERRY Bug guy.
ELAINE Why do you have a bug guy?
JERRY I have fleas.
ELAINE Argh.. Fleas How did you get fleas?
JERRY I don't know...But every one's got to clear out of the apartment for two days. I don't know what I'm gonna do with my parents. they'll never let me pay for a hotel and if they go to someplace on their own I'm sure it's gonna be some awful dump. Wait a second.. Have you checked in The Plaza yet?
ELAINE No....Oh No....
JERRY Come on,c'mon
ELAINE No, No...
JERRY c'mon ,c'mon....
ELAINE No, No...

GEORGE yeah!
ELAINE Well what about you. Where you gonna stay?
JERRY I dunno , I'm gonna ask Shelley ,but she still might be upset from the masticated pecan incident.
ELAINE Hey!! I found out from Paula; She likes George. I'll bet he'll be relieved.
JERRY Yeah.. When he's dead he'll be relieved... Oh by the way Viking Press sent a Fedex for you to my parents. They brought it with 'em.
ELAINE Yeah that's just some stuff about the company.
GEORGE Hum.. Hey! did you talk to Paula?
ELAINE Yeah.
GEORGE So what did she say?
ELAINE She...likes you..
GEORGE She said she liked me. No kiddin' she said that?
ELAINE Ya!
GEORGE Those were her exact words, I like George.
ELAINE Yep!
GEORGE Ha Haaaaaaa... Jerry how do you like that.You see I get myself in a dizzy, I'm all worked up and for what?
ELAINE For nothing..
GEORGE ha Ha..
ELAINE In fact she said that looks aren't even that important to her...
GEORGE You see.....what!
ELAINE Ah Oh!!
GEORGE She said looks aren't important to her?
ELAINE Well..hum...let me rephrase that, She said....
GEORGE She thinks I'm ugly. I knew it.
JERRY You see the thing of it is, there's a lot of ugly people out there walking around, but they don't know they're ugly, because nobody actually tells them.
GEORGE .....So what's your point?
JERRY I dunno...
ELAINE Okay.. The point , George, is she likes you.
GEORGE Oh!, so what. I'd rather she hate me and thought I was good looking....At least I can get somebody else. What is this? Why am I itching?
JERRY That'd be the fleas.
JERRY Hey!!!
MORTY Hey! I do you like this? Huh, huh!
HELEN Oh! my god, Morty lets go, this is too nice.
MORTY Hey! This is the kind of room Sinatra stays in. Hey! look , Macadamian nuts.

ELAINE Hi, Thank you so much for recommending me to Viking Press .
JUDY It is my pleasure , just make sure you give that manuscript a good read.
ELAINE Manuscript?
JUDY Yeah. I'm sure they Fedexed you a manuscript. They want to see that you can read an unpublished work and give insightful criticism.
ELAINE Oooh!!
JUDY Read it twice if you have to. This is a big step in your career.
ELAINE Yeah! hmmm..I gotta go..
JUDY Hey! What about lunch?
ELAINE I gotta gooo...
ELAINE Thank god I found you..
JERRY Oh! Hey!
ELAINE You still got that Fedex?

ELAINE No I'll take my chances. Come on...
JERRY You see?
ELAINE Jerry , I need that Fedex right now..
JERRY I told you to take it.
ELAINE Well, I didn't know that it was a manuscript that I had to read...
JERRY Well, You can't go in there it's like a gas chamber in there.
KRAMER I left a Macanaw peach in your refrigerator.
JERRY Kramer, they're fumigating. There's toxic gas in there.
KRAMER Toxic gas!!!
JERRY Aw! You'll be fine, you were in there for what , a couple of minutes.
KRAMER An hour and a half!!! I was reading a manuscript, I just couldn't put it down.
ELAINE My manuscript?
JERRY How do you feel?
KRAMER Now that you mention it , a little woozy.
ELAINE Kramer You got go back in there grab my manuscript.

KRAMER I left it on the coffee table or somethin'
JERRY Well wh..wh.what are you doing?

JERRY Didn't you see the sign on the door?
KRAMER Well I thought it was so your parents wouldn't walk in while you're with a girl.
ELAINE It's not on any table, Kramer. Where is it?
KRAMER Well I don't know . I was in the bathroom , the kitchen...
ELAINE Okay... bathroom....kitchen.
JERRY Can you get me a soda?
KRAMER Jerry, I had some milk, I made a sandwich. I got to get out of the building.
ELAINE I couldn't find it anywhere. How did you get fleas anyway?
JERRY I don't know. Who could've been in my apartment.
ELAINE I 've looked everywhere , even under the couch but all I could find were the stupid Chunky wrappers. I couldn't....
JERRY Wait a minute . Did you say chunky wrappers?
ELAINE Yeah!
JERRY Let me see those. Oh! I know the chunky that left these Chunkies......Newman! I've got him.
JERRY Newman . Open the door, Newman, I know you're in there.
NEWMAN Hello jerry. What a pleasant surprise.
JERRY There's nothing pleasant about it, so lets just cut the crap.. You gave me fleas. I know it and you know it..
NEWMAN Fleas? Bwa ha ha ha ha .That's preposterous. How can I , give you fleas. Now if you don't mind...
JERRY Oh! but I do. There's probably fleas crawling all over your little snack bar.
NEWMAN So , you have fleas. Maybe you keep your house in a state of disrepair. Maybe you live in squalor.
JERRY You know Newman , the thing about fleas is that they irritate the skin and they start to...itch. Oh! maybe you can hold out five seconds or ten, maybe fifteen or twenty but after a while, no matter how much will power a person may have. It won't matter, because they're crawling , crawling on your skin. Up your legs , up your spine , up your back.....
NEWMAN Baaaaaaaaarrhhhhhhhhhhh....I'm ripped with fleas
MORTY Oh! Oh! That feels good. Hey! This guy charges a hundred bucks an hour but I'm telling ya he's worth every penny oh!
HELEN I'm next.
MORTY Hey! Leo, get this, four movies at once; Pay Per View.
LEO I love these nuts.
NANA This Champagne's gone flat.
HELEN Nana!!!
NANA He Ha Ha Ha...Let the chambermaid clean it up
GEORGE Hello..
PAULA What's the matter?...
GEORGE Well I spoke to Elaine...
PAULA Hey! Look , no shave.
GEORGE No...Why should that make any difference to you?
PAULA It doesn't..
GEORGE Of course not. You don't care what I look like.
PAULA That's right I don't.
GEORGE I suppose I could just pull this out and walk around like this and you wouldn't care?
PAULA Not a wit.
GEORGE Hu humm? i suppose we could go to Lincoln Center and I'd be wearing sneakers and jeans and that would be fine too.
PAULA You can wear sweatpants.
GEORGE I could..
PAULA You could drape yourself in velvet, for all I care.
GEORGE Velvet...
ELAINE Did you read the whole thing?
KRAMER Oh! yeah.
ELAINE Huh . So What's it about?
KRAMER Well it's a story about love, deception, greed, lust and...unbridled enthusiasm.
ELAINE unbridled enthusiasm...?
KRAMER Well , that's what led to Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
ELAINE Oh! boy.
KRAMER You see Elaine, Billy was a simple country boy. You might say a cockeyed optimist, who got himself mixed up in the high stakes game of world diplomacy and international intrigue.
ELAINE Oh! my God.
KRAMER ah! Here we go.
ELAINE can I have a scotch on the rocks.
KRAMER May I..
ELAINE Yeah! go ahead.
KRAMER what is this?
ELAINE What? What are you doin'?
KRAMER I can't taste this.
ELAINE What are you talking about?
KRAMER This food ,it has no taste......nothin' I'm gettin' nothin'... It must be the toxic gas from the fumigation......
JERRY Hey, thanks a lot for lettin' me stay here.
SHELLY Well, I don't keep pecans in the house so I didn't think it'd be a problem.
JERRY ...Oh! Damn..
SHELLY What's the matter?
JERRY I forgot my toothbrush.
SHELLY Oh! no problem.....You can use mine.
JERRY Yours?....You know what I'll think I'll brush later.
SHELLY Brush now.
JERRY .......Sure.
KRAMER Newman ,Let me have a bite of your Macanaw..
NEWMAN What for, you got your own.
KRAMER Come on ,c'mon i need to taste it. .....Nothin' , Can't even taste a Macanaw.
NEWMAN Well that's a shame.
KRAMER Waited all year and I can't even taste it..
NEWMAN You can't taste 'em . Why waste 'em . Why not give them all to me.
ELAINE It's a story about love , deception ,greed , lust and.... unbridled enthusiasm .
MANDEL Unbridled enthusiasm.
ELAINE Yeah!..tha..that's right. that That's what led to... Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
MANDEL hmmm...interesting take. So you believe, has he not been so enthusiastic he could have adverted disaster.
ELAINE Yes...Ye..Yes..That's right...You see ,Billy Mumphrey was a simple country boy. Some might say a cockeyed optimist, who got caught up in the dirty game of world diplomacy and International intrigue.
MANDEL So.. It was more a question of attitude than politics..
ELAINE Yes, yes Mr. Mandel.
MORTY Hey! Under Siege is on again. Whose up for it?
LEO No more nuts. Awrghh.....
JERRY Oh! my god. What the hell is this? ..... Don't tell me.......Velvet!!!
GEORGE It's the real deal.
JERRY She's seen you in this thing.
GEORGE That's right...We just had sex......You know Jerry I've been searching for someone a long time. Well the search is over.
JERRY And now the search for the right psychiatrist begins.
GEORGE He he...So huh! What's with the suitcase.
JERRY Ahh! She threw me out.
GEORGE Why?
JERRY I wouldn't use her toothbrush.
GEORGE So where are you staying?
JERRY Well I guess I'm stuck with the Velvet Fog.
MANDEL Three hours of massage time , twelve in-room movies including several adult features, five shoe shines and four hundred dolars worth of snacks. Not to mention the damage to the room.
ELAINE Mr Mandel, you don't understand ...my my friend had fleas. I ran into the gas , it could have killed me, and my, my other friend couldn't taste his peaches ,they only good for two weeks.
MANDEL I think , you've read, one too many, Billy Mumphrey stories. Good day Miss Benes.
ELAINE Okay...Good day..
PAULA Hi George.
GEORGE Hi, this is fantastic D'you ever had a Macanaw peach?
PAULA Oh! yeah I love those.
GEORGE Too bad , it's all done.
KRAMER ya....Yes!....Yes! it's back I can taste again. Hey! What's the date today?
PASSERBY The fifteenth.
KRAMER Fifteenth , Yes last day for the Macanaws. I can still make it. Wait.. Newman...
NEWMAN Sorry , last one . Would you want to suck the pit?
KRAMER Look Hubert. It's the mailman. You remember the mailman don't you.
ELAINE Hello is anybody here?..
LEO They said they were sending an Asian woman.
ELAINE Oh! my God.
PUDDY Alright, be careful with the car, babe.
ELAINE Yeah, yeah.
PUDDY And don't move the seat, I got it right where I like it.
ELAINE Goodbye?
PUDDY Two and ten, babe.
ELAINE Okay.
PUDDY Don't peel out.
ELAINE I won't. Jesus?
KRUGER According to our latest quarterly thing,Kruger Industrial Smoothing is heading into the red. Or the black, or whatever the bad one is. Any thoughts?
GEORGE Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, I sometimes drop off my rent check having forgotten to sign it. That could buy us some time.
KRUGER Works for me. Good thinking, George.
COWORKER_1 Alright, George.
COWORKER_2 Way to go man.
GEORGE Or we don't even send the check and then when they call, we pretend we're the cleaning service. Heh heh. "Hello? I sorry, no here Kruger."
KRUGER Are you done? Silly voices, c'mon people, let's get real.
COWORKER_1 Good one.
COWORKER_2 That was bad.
GEORGE I had 'em, Jerry. They loved me.
JERRY And then?
GEORGE I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during a meeting but by the end it's buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns.
JERRY Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, you say goodnight and walk off.
GEORGE I can't just leave.
JERRY That's the way they do it in Vegas.
GEORGE You never played Vegas.
JERRY I hear things. Elaine enters and has a seat.
ELAINE Here's one. I borrowed Puddy's car and all the presets on his radio were Christian rock stations.
GEORGE I like Christian rock. It's very positive. It's not like those real musicians who think they're so cool and hip.
ELAINE So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something?
JERRY It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets.
ELAINE Yes, he is lazy.
JERRY Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons.
ELAINE Yes, he is dumb.
JERRY So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?
ELAINE Dumb and lazy, I understand.
GEORGE Tell you how you could check.
ELAINE How?
GEORGE Reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back. You know? The old switcheroo.
JERRY No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other person's.
GEORGE No, it's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you.
JERRY Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the radio did to her.
GEORGE Well that's the gist of it!
ELAINE Quiet! So where is this Sophie?
JERRY Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes.
ELAINE How long have you two been together?
JERRY I dunno. Since the last one. Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her?
ELAINE_AND_GEORGE Nah.
GEORGE By the way, how did Puddy get back in the picture?
ELAINE I needed to move a bureau.
KRAMER Hey Jerry, you got any pepper?
MICKEY Hey Jerry.
JERRY Hey Mickey. Check the pepper shaker.
KRAMER Yeah. See? It should sound like that, something like that.
MICKEY Aah-choo.
KRAMER A little wetter. See, I didn't believe it.
JERRY What's with the fake sneezing?
KRAMER Yeah, we're going down to Mt. Sinai Hospital, See they hire actors to help the students practice diagnosing.
MICKEY They assign you a specific disease and you act out the symptoms. It's an easy gig.
JERRY Do medical schools actually do this?
KRAMER Well the better ones. Alright, let's practice retching.
JERRY I think the phone is ringing. Would you hold it a second?! Thank you, will you get out of here with that stuff?
KRAMER Mickey, dts.
JERRY Hello?
SOPHIE Hey. It's me.
JERRY Elaine?
SOPHIE No, it's me.
JERRY George??
SOPHIE Jerry, it's Sophie. I can't believe you don't recognize my voice.
JERRY Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. I'm a comedian.
KRAMER You got any Ipecac?
JERRY Ipecac? Kramer, I really think you guys are going too far with this.
KRAMER No, Mickey, he swallowed twelve aspirin.
JERRY Did he overdose?
KRAMER No, it's just too much.
KRUGER ...And it gets worse. The team working on the statue in Lafayette Square kind of over-smoothed it. They ground the head down to about the size of a softball, and that spells trouble.
GEORGE Alright, well why don't we smooth the head down to nothing, stick a pumpkin under its arm and change the nameplate to Ichabod Crane?
GEORGE Alright! That's it for me. Goodnight everybody.
DR._WEXLER In your packet you will find the disease you have been assigned and the symptoms you will need to exhibit.
MICKEY Bacterial Meningitis. Jackpot!
KRAMER Gonorrhea? You wanna trade?
MICKEY Sorry buddy, this is the "Hamlet" of diseases. Severe pain, nausea, delusions, it's got everything.
KRAMER Howbout you, do you wanna trade?
MAN Sure.
KRAMER Okay, what do you got?
MAN The surgeon left a sponge inside me.
KRAMER Good luck with that.
GEORGE I knew I had hit my high note so I thanked the crowd and I was gone.
JERRY What did you do the rest of the day?
GEORGE I saw "Titanic". So that old woman, she's just a liar, right?
JERRY And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.
ELAINE Hello boys.
GEORGE Hey, so, did you give that radio the old switcheroo?
ELAINE I did.
GEORGE And the Christian rock?
ELAINE Ressurected! And look what I pried off of his bumper, a Jesus fish!
GEORGE Jerry, do you have any fishsticks?
JERRY No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person?
ELAINE Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel misled.
GEORGE I think it's neat. You don't hear that much about god anymore.
JERRY I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the "It's me" on the phone today.
ELAINE "It's me?" Isn't it a little premature?
JERRY I thought so.
ELAINE Hah. She's not a "me". I'm a "me".
GEORGE I'm against all "it's me"s. So self-absorbed and egotistical, it's like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes!
KRAMER Well, I got gonorrhea.
ELAINE That seems about right.
KRAMER That's what they gave me.
GEORGE They? The Government?
JERRY No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose it.
KRAMER And it's a waste of my talent. It's just a little burning. Mickey, he got bacterial meningitis.
GEORGE I guess there are no small diseases, only small actors. The other three start laughing.
GEORGE Alright that's it for me. Good night everybody.
ELAINE What was that?
JERRY Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note.
KRAMER See, showmanship. Maybe that's what my gonorrhea is missing.
JERRY Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back row.
KRAMER Yes, yes I will! I'm gonna make people feel my gonorrhea, and feel the gonorrhea themselves.
STUDENT_1 And are you experiencing any discomfort?
KRAMER Just a little burning during urination.
STUDENT_1 Okay, any other pain?
KRAMER The haunting memories of lost love. May I? Lights? Our eyes met across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher. Oh, I pursued and she withdrew, then she pursued and I withdrew, and so we danced. I burned for her, much like the burning during urination that I would experience soon afterwards.
STUDENT_1 Gonorrhea?!
KRAMER Gonorrhea!
JERRY One message. Hope it's not from you.
ANSWERING_MACHINE "Hey Jerry, it's me. Call me back."
JERRY Sophie.
GEORGE She's still doing that?
JERRY Yep.
GEORGE Alright, I'll tell you what you do. You call her back and give her the "it's me", heh? Pull the old switcheroo.
JERRY I think that's a "what's good for the goose is good for the gander".
GEORGE What the hell is a gander, anyway?
JERRY It's a goose that's had the old switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie, it's me.
SOPHIE Hey Raef.
JERRY She thinks it's someone named Raef.
GEORGE Good, let her think it.
JERRY So, what's going on?
SOPHIE Not a lot.
GEORGE Ask about you, ask about you.
JERRY So, uh, how are things with Jerry?
SOPHIE Oh, I really like him but, well, I still haven't told him the tractor story.
JERRY Right, right, the tractor story.
SOPHIE Are you sick, Raef? You sound kinda funny.
JERRY I sound funny?
GEORGE Abort! Abort!
JERRY Yeah I better get to a doctor, bye. That was close! What drives me to take chances like that?
GEORGE That was very real.
JERRY She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about.
GEORGE Woah, back it up, back it up. Beep, beep, beep. Tractor story?
JERRY Beep, beep, beep? What are you doing?
ELAINE So where do you wanna eat?
PUDDY Feels like an Arby's night.
ELAINE Arby's. Beef and cheese and do you believe in god?
PUDDY Yes.
ELAINE Oh. So, you're pretty religious?
PUDDY That's right.
ELAINE So is it a problem that I'm not really religious?
PUDDY Not for me.
ELAINE Why not?
PUDDY I'm not the one going to hell.
GEORGE You know what I think? I bet she stole a tractor.
JERRY No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. We're dancing around the obvious, it's gotta be disfigurement.
GEORGE Does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need?
JERRY No, she looks completely normal.
GEORGE Oh. Okay, here it is, I got it. She lost her thumbs in a tractor accident and they grafted her big toes on. They do it every day.
JERRY You think she's got toes for thumbs?
GEORGE How's her handshake? A little firm, isn't it? Maybe a little too firm?
JERRY I don't know.
GEORGE Hands a little smelly?
JERRY Why do I seek your counsel?
ELAINE Well I'm going to hell.
JERRY That seems about right.
ELAINE According to Puddy.
JERRY Hey, have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and the doughtnuts and--
ELAINE I'm not in the mood.
GEORGE I'll have some coffee and a doughnut.
JERRY What do you care? You don't believe in hell.
ELAINE I know, but he does.
JERRY So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of your soul.
ELAINE Well, relationships are very important to me.
JERRY Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for all eternity.
GEORGE And a slice of devil's food cake.
GEORGE Hey. Where is everyone?
MR._KRUGER They're all off the project. They were boring. George, you are my main man.
GEORGE I am?
MR._KRUGER I don't know what it is, I can't put my finger on it, but lately you have just seemed 'on'. And you always leave me wanting more.
GEORGE This is a huge project involving lots of numbers and papers and folders.
MR._KRUGER Ah, I'm not too worried about it. Let's get started.
GEORGE Okay.
MR._KRUGER George? Check it out. Three times around, no feet.
GEORGE And?
MR._KRUGER All me.
DR._WEXLER Alright, and here are you ailments for this week. By the way, Mr. Kramer, you were excellent.
KRAMER Oh, thank you.
MICKEY Cirrhosis of the liver with jaundice! Alright I get to wear make-up! What did you get?
KRAMER Gonorrhea? Excuse me, I think there's been a mistake, see, I had gonorrhea last week.
DR._WEXLER Oh, it's no mistake. We loved what you did with it.
KRAMER I don't believe this, I'm being typecast.
SOPHIE I move my knight... here. Check.
JERRY They should update these pieces, nobody rides horses anymore. Maybe they should change it to a tractor.
SOPHIE Jerry, are you embarrassed that you're losing?
JERRY Losing? You know, yesterday I lost control of my car, almost bought the farm.
SOPHIE Bought the farm?
JERRY Tractor!
SOPHIE This is an odd side of you, Jerry. I feel uncomfortable.
JERRY Wait, don't go. Let's thumb wrestle.
GEORGE A scar?
JERRY A big long scar where her leg would dangle when she's riding a...?
GEORGE A tractor.
JERRY I'm sure she's a little self-conscious and doesn't like to talk about it.
GEORGE I don't see why's she more self-conscious about that than her toe thumbs.
JERRY She doesn't have toe thumbs.
GEORGE Well, if she keeps horsing around with that tractor--
JERRY Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?
GEORGE Two-man? It's all me. Kruger doesn't do anything; Disappears for hours at a time, gives me fake excuses. This afternoon I found him with sleep creases on his face. The only reason I got out to get a bite today was that he finally promised to buckle down and do some actual work. Mr. Kruger? Who said he was going to do some actual work today? Who?
MR._KRUGER I'm not too worried about it.
GEORGE Well I am. Couldn't you try to go through some of that stuff I put in your shoebox?
MR._KRUGER Alright, alright I'm going.
GEORGE Huh-ho! Have you ever seen anything like this?
JERRY Never.
PUDDY Elaine, they forgot to deliver your paper today. Why don't you just grab that one.
ELAINE 'Cause that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy, that's his.
PUDDY C'mon, get it.
ELAINE Well if you want it, you get it.
PUDDY Sorry, thou shalt not steal.
ELAINE Oh, but it's ok for me?
PUDDY What do you care, you know where you're going.
ELAINE Alright, that is it! I can't live like this.
PUDDY Nah.
ELAINE C'mon.
PUDDY Alright, what did I do?
ELAINE David, I'm going to hell! The worst place in the world! With devils and those caves and the ragged clothing! And the heat! My god, the heat! I mean, what do you think about all that?
PUDDY Gonna be rough.
ELAINE Uh, you should be trying to save me!
PUDDY Don't boss me! This is why you're going to hell.
ELAINE I am not going to hell and if you think I'm going to hell, you should care that I'm going to hell even though I am not.
PUDDY You stole my Jesus fish, didn't you?
ELAINE Yeah, that's right! Elaine places her hands beside her head, index fingers raised as 'horns' and she emits a gutteral growling sound.
MICKEY Oh, my liver! Why did I drink all those years? Why did I look for love in a bottle?
DR._WEXLER Mr. Kramer? You're up. Kramer walks in, his face is noticably yellow.
MICKEY Wait a minute. You are doing gonorrhea, aren't you?
KRAMER Well, we'll see.
STUDENT_2 So, what seems to be bothering you today, Mr. Kramer?
KRAMER Well, I guess it started about twenty years ago when I got back from Viet Nam, and this was the only friend I had left.
MICKEY Hey! That's my cirrhosis! He's stealing my cirrhosis! You wanna be sick? I'll make you sick.
STUDENT_2 Cirrhosis of the liver and PCP addiction?
FATHER_CURTIS Let me see if I understand this. You're concerned that he isn't concerned that you're going to hell. And you feel that she's too bossy.
ELAINE_AND_PUDDY Yeah, that's right.
FATHER_CURTIS Well, oftentimes in cases of inter-faith marriages, couples have difficulty--
ELAINE Woah, woah, woah! No one's getting married here.
FATHER_CURTIS You aren't?
PUDDY No.
ELAINE We're just, you know, having a good time.
FATHER_CURTIS Oh, well then it's simple. You're both going to hell.
PUDDY No way, this is bogus, man!
ELAINE Well, thank you father.
FATHER_CURTIS Oh, did you hear the one about the new guy in hell who's talkng to the devil by the coffee machine?
PUDDY I'm really not in the mood, I'm going to hell.
ELAINE Oh, lighten up. It'll only feel like an eternity.
SOPHIE You know, Jerry, there's this thing that I haven't told you about. See, there was this tractor and, oh boy, this is really difficult.
JERRY Sophie, it's me. I know about the tractor story and I'm fine with it.
SOPHIE How could you know?
JERRY Shh. Shh. Shh. It's not important. What's important is I'm not gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long-term and meaningful relationship.
KRAMER ...I didn't say that, no.
MICKEY You gave me gonorrhea, you didn't even tell me!
KRAMER Well, I'm sorry. I gave you gonorrhea because I thought you'd have fun with it.
JERRY Hey, hey! I'm with someone.
KRAMER Oh. Hello.
SOPHIE No, I understand. This could be a tough thing to deal with. The important thing is that you have a partner who's supportive.
KRAMER You know? She's right.
SOPHIE Unfortunately, I didn't have a partner. I got gonorrhea from a tractor.
JERRY You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And you call that your tractor story??
KRAMER You can't get it from that.
SOPHIE But I did. My boyfriend said I got gonorrhea from riding the tractor in my bathing suit.
JERRY Alright, that's it for me. You've been great. Goodnight everybody.
GEORGE Would you mind helping me out with some of this stuff?!?
MR._KRUGER You seem like you've got a pretty good handle on it.
GEORGE No! I don't! Don't you even care? This is your company! It's your name on the outside of the building! Speaking of which, the 'R' fell off and all it says now is K-uger!
MR._KRUGER K-uger, that sounds like one of those old-time car horns, huh? K-uger! K-uger!
GEORGE Huh-ho! Oh! You are too much, Mr. Kruger! Too much!
MR._KRUGER Thank you George, you've been great. That's it for me.
GEORGE Oh no, you're not going out on a high note with me Mr. Kruger!
MR._KRUGER It's K-uger!
GEORGE No! No!
MR._KRUGER Goodnight everybody!
JERRY The big new accessory with eyeglasses, seems to be that strap, that connects in the back so you can take 'em on and off. Which I don't get, because I thought, if you have glasses, isn't that because you need to wear glasses? 'You need glasses', isn't that what they say? I mean, an eye doctor doesn't say 'Would you care for some glasses?' When people have crutches, they don't havelike a little chain attached to their belt, so they can just let go of 'em every now and then. Why not get a toupee with a rubber band for when you're water-skiing, the thing could just...
GARY Hey George.
GEORGE Gary? Well, well, well well. Where the hell've you been? I've been leaving you phone messages for months.
GARY I know. I've been pretty busy.
GEORGE Busy. Don't give me busy. Who's not busy? I'm busy, we're all busy, everybody's busy. All right, tell me, what's kept you so busy?
GARY Mostly chemotherapy. 'Kay, I'll see you.
KRAMER Hey pig!
COP Hey! Hey! Hey!
JERRY So you called the cop a pig?
KRAMER I was yelling at the litterbug. I mean this is my town. You don't throw trash on the streets of my town.
JERRY Didn't you explain that to the cop?
KRAMER No, I fled the scene.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER Hey buddy.
GEORGE Hey, uh...
KRAMER What?
GEORGE Kramer, I, I, I, uh, I need to talk to Jerry privately.
KRAMER Oh. What about?
GEORGE Kramer...
KRAMER Aw come on George, you can share it with me, huh?
GEORGE Hey, you're hurting me!
KRAMER You gonna share it with me next time, huh?
GEORGE I swear, I swear!
KRAMER Aw, all right, I'm looking forward to it.
GEORGE Right, I got news. You ready? Gary Fogel had cancer.
JERRY Oh yeah, I knew.
GEORGE You knew? How did you know?
JERRY He told me a few months ago.
GEORGE Why did he tell you and not me?
JERRY I don't know.
GEORGE How are you closer to him than me?
GEORGE So, is he okay?
JERRY Oh yeah, he's fine, fine. He was in bad shape for a while though.
GEORGE Huh, really? How bad? Was he on his death bed?
JERRY No, he was on his regular bed.
GEORGE So why didn't you tell me?
JERRY He swore me to secrecy.
GEORGE So?
JERRY It's not like you're my wife.
GEORGE Well, I still think you shoulda told me.
JERRY Hey, believe me, you were better off not knowing. It's not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this. I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick.
GEORGE Well, I wanna talk to him about this.
JERRY That's right, you let him have it.
GEORGE Mmm-mm.
JERRY Who is he not to tell you about his life-threatening illness?
GEORGE That's what I'm saying.
JERRY His illness is your business.
GEORGE If not mine, whose?
JERRY If not now, when?
ELAINE Were you just talking about me?
GEORGE No, an old friend of ours, Gary.
ELAINE Oh, the guy with cancer?
GEORGE You told her? She's not your wife!
JERRY If I told you, you woulda given it away.
GEORGE You don't think I can keep a secret?
JERRY No, but he would've read your face.
GEORGE You don't trust my poker face?
JERRY Do you ever win at poker?
GEORGE No.
KRAMER Hey. Oh, I just saw your old boyfriend on TV.
ELAINE Egh, Jake Jarmel?
KRAMER Yeah. I really liked those glasses he was wearing. Where'd he get those.
ELAINE Why? You don't wear glasses.
KRAMER I know, I know. But I need a new look, I'm stagnating.
GEORGE I have to say, as a glasses wearer I take exception to that. That's like me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in.
KRAMER Yeah, I've considered that. Look, how do I get in touch with this guy?
ELAINE Well, he's having a two day book signing at Waldens.
KRAMER Ah.
ELAINE You know, we had a really bad break-up.
JERRY The Jujy Fruits?
ELAINE Yeah, the Jujy Fruits.
JAKE Okay, K-Man, enjoy the book.
KRAMER Okay, thank you. Listen Jake, uh, where did you get those eyeglass frames?
JAKE I can't tell you that.
KRAMER So you don't know where you got 'em?
JAKE Yes I do. But I don't want anyone else to have them.
KRAMER Well, that's peculiar.
GEORGE Eh, there's that woman that never talks to anybody.
GARY Really?
GEORGE Every day she comes in, she sits at that table and reads. Never talks to anybody.
GARY Oh, I talked to Debby Bibelo. She said to say hi.
GEORGE Really? You know Gary, I really have to say, I'm a little bit hurt that you didn't decide to confide in me.
GARY Well frankly, you can't keep a secret. You know, you'd get two pair, the whole table knows.
GEORGE Well I still think it was wrong.
GARY Right, well I'm sorry, all right. I guess I was just thinking of myself.
GEORGE Yes.
KRAMER ...so I called the litterbug a pig, not you. I like policeman. I wanted to be a policeman.
COP Yeah? So why didn't you?
KRAMER Scared of being shot.
COP Mr Kramer, let me tell you a story. In nineteen-seventy-nine I ticketed a brown Dodge Diplomat for parking in a Church zone. That fine was never paid, and since then that scofflaw has piled up more parking tickets than anyone in New York City. For sixteen years I pursued him, only to see him give me the slip time and time again. I never got a clean look at his face, but he's become my 'white whale'. Mr Kramer, that day was yesterday! But thanks to you, I don't know if I'll ever get that chance again!
KRAMER I like that eye patch.
GEORGE All right, I'm gonna move my car, my meter's up. Can't park in this city.
GARY Hey, George, listen. You know that company I work for, they own that parking lot around the corner.
GEORGE Wha, that's a Kinney lot?
GARY Yeah, and there's a space opening up, and I could get it for you. You just have to pay the tax on it. It'd be like, fifty a month.
GEORGE Fifty bucks a month, that's incredible! Okay, thanks.
GARY All right, I got lunch, all right.
GEORGE You still owe me a secret.
GARY All right, listen. There is something I haven't told you, all right?
GEORGE Yeah?
GARY Yeah, but uhm, you can't tell Jerry.
GEORGE What do think I tell Jerry everything? It's not like he's my wife.
GARY Okay. Well, the thing is, I've been living a lie.
GEORGE Just one? I'm living like twenty. What's yours?
GARY Well, I I never actually had cancer. I'll see you.
ELAINE So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses?
KRAMER Flat out refused!
ELAINE Yeah, isn't that just like him? You know, he has to be the only one who has 'em.
KRAMER Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister. Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi.
ELAINE What? You told Jake I said hi?
KRAMER Yeah.
ELAINE I can't believe you did that! Why did you tell him I said hi? I never said hi! When did I say hi?
JERRY I never heard her say hi.
KRAMER Well, it's uh, common courtesy.
ELAINE No, no. Kramer, you don't understand. He made the last contact between us. I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship. If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand.
JERRY It's like a game of tag.
JERRY Where you going?
ELAINE Nowhere.
JERRY You're going to the book store to see Jake Jarmel, aren't you?
ELAINE So what if I do?
KRAMER Yeah, well, listen. If you're going there, maybe you can get him to tell you where he got those glasses. Elaine!
JERRY Hey. How'd it go with Gary?
GEORGE Fine, fine.
JERRY Really?
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY You look like something's on your mind.
GEORGE No. Nothing. Fine.
JERRY So, that's your poker face.
GEORGE My regular face.
JERRY No it isn't. I've seen your regular face. That is not it.
GEORGE What are you saying?
JERRY All right George, c'mon, what d'you got?
GEORGE I got nothing.
JERRY What you got, a pair of bullets?
GEORGE What you talking about?
JERRY Two pair? Three of a kind?
GEORGE Will you stop it?
JERRY Oh my God, you got a flush! You're holding a flush!
GEORGE I don't have a flush.
JERRY A full house? You got a full house? Turn 'em over George, I wanna see 'em. Come on, I'm calling! What d'you got!
GEORGE Gary Fogel never had cancer!
ELAINE So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you from me. When in fact it was an unauthorised hi.
JAKE You're saying you didn't say hi.
ELAINE That's what I'm saying.
JAKE So that's what you came down here to tell me?
ELAINE Correct.
JAKE You never said hi?
ELAINE Correct.
JAKE You still like me, don't you?
ELAINE Correct. What's that?
MAN Hey, I have been trying to get this book signed all day.
ELAINE How can you say that I still like you, when I didn't even say hi to you?
JAKE Elaine, coming down here to say that you didn't say hi is more of a gesture than if you did say hi.
ELAINE Ah, Jake... I, uh...
GEORGE The doctors thought he had cancer, but the surgery revealed he never actually had it.
JERRY So what was wrong with him?
GEORGE Nothing!
JERRY So he's been lying to me for two months?!
GEORGE That's right.
JERRY What kind of person is this? There's only one other person who might be able to do something like this, and that's you.
GEORGE Well...
JERRY I don't even think you could do it.
GEORGE Oh, I could do it.
JERRY Yeah, I guess you could.
GEORGE C'mon.
JERRY Did you know he was so worried about losing more hair if he had to get chemo treatment, I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the Hair Team For Men, just to put his mind at ease?
GEORGE You did that?
JERRY Yeah. Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy.
GEORGE Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't say anything.
JERRY Why not?
GEORGE Because he'll know I told you. Besides, he's giving me a parking spot around the corner for practically nothing.
JERRY So you're telling me, because you're getting free parking, I gotta pretend this guy had cancer when he didn't?
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY Well I don't like it. I don't like it one bit! And, I'm supposed to see him tomorrow.
GEORGE Yeah, well you have to maintain the same disposition too. You can't start acting any differently. You have to be nice.
JERRY Why didn't he tell me?
GEORGE Because you were being so nice.
JERRY I don't think I can be that nice.
GEORGE You be nice!
JERRY Gary?
GARY What d'you think? Check it out.
JERRY Is that from my gift certificate?
GARY Yeah buddy. You really came through for me man. You've been so nice.
JERRY Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage.
GARY Hey, you know what I'm thinking of doing? I'm getting rid of all my fillings, 'cos that mercury's toxic. Hey, let me see your fillings.
JERRY I don't think so.
GARY Oh come on, open up. Let me take a look.
GEORGE You be nice! He's giving me a parking space parking space... parking space...
GARY Well, what d'you know. Hey, lookee there, you're loaded.
JERRY Okay.
GARY Hey, look who's over there. Miss Cool-toes. Check this out, Jack!
KRAMER Hey buddy.
JERRY Hey. Look at you. Wha... what's this?
KRAMER It's an eyepatch.
JERRY You look like a pirate.
KRAMER I wanna be a pirate.
JERRY This is Gary.
KRAMER How you doing?
GARY All right.
KRAMER Well, I tell you there's only one problem.
JERRY Can't see on your right side?
KRAMER No. It's uh, it's itchy
DEBBY Nice car.
GEORGE Yeah. Once belonged to Jon Voight.
DEBBY So, what made you just call me out of the blue like that?
GEORGE Oh, well, uh. Gary told me you said hi.
DEBBY I didn't say hi.
GEORGE You didn't?
DEBBY Uh, no. I told him to send you my regards. I didn't say hi.
GEORGE Regards?
DEBBY Yeah, regards.
ELAINE Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug. Oh, I hate smugness. Don't you hate smugness?
CABBIE Smugness is not a good quality.
ELAINE Oh my God. That man over there. I think he's wearing glasses that look just like Jake's. Pull over, stop the car. Here, here. I think I got a way of getting back at my ex-boyfriend.
CABBIE Good. Revenge is very good.
ELAINE 'Scuse me! 'Scuse me. Excuse me, sir. Sir?
GUY Yes?
ELAINE Uh. Ah, if you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses?
GUY Malaysia.
ELAINE Malaysia?
GUY Yeah.
ELAINE Uhm, look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?
GUY Actually, I was gonna buy a new pair.
ELAINE Oh!
GUY But I, I can barely see without these.
ELAINE C'mon.
GUY Well, these were expensive.
ELAINE Let's start the bidding.
GEORGE So, you didn't think this was a date?
DEBBY N... no, not really. Why, is it... a date?
GEORGE I thought it was a date.
DEBBY No. It's not a date.
GEORGE What about the regards?
DEBBY Regards don't mean anything. I mean, it's not like I said hi. Hey, the fact is... I shouldn't say anything.
GEORGE No, tell me.
DEBBY Can you keep a secret?
GEORGE Me? Oh yeah.
DEBBY I never had feelings for Gary until he got sick. But, h... he was so brave and... and gained such a wonderful perspective on life. I... I fell in love with him.
GEORGE Oh, the guy's got some perspective there.
JERRY Hey, do you know what the Whip does?
KRAMER What whip?
JERRY The Whip. In the Senate, in the House.
KRAMER Well, you know in the old days, when the senators didn't vote the way that the party leaders wanted 'em to... they whipped them. You better vote the way we want you to, or there's gonna be big trouble.
GARY She won't talk to anyone, huh? Oh no, she won't say a word to anybody. Well, she's talking a blue streak now, Jack!
COP Well, well. The 'white whale'.
GEORGE Oh, look at this. There's no place to park around here. I don't even know why they sell cars in Manhattan.
DEBBY Don't complain, at least you have your health.
DEBBY George, look out for that man!
COP Hey! Hey, get back here!
KRAMER Newman! The white whale!
GEORGE Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street?
JERRY Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig? Would you do that?
GEORGE No. Definitely not.
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.
JERRY And you know what else? He picked up that woman in the coffee shop.
GEORGE The one who always sits by herself?
JERRY Yeah!
GEORGE How did he do that?
JERRY Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.
GEORGE Really? And Debby told me that she fell in love with him because he has all this perspective!
JERRY She thinks a guy who lies about a life-threatening illness, so he can get some phony hair has perspective?
GEORGE He picked her up?
JERRY Walked right over to her table.
GEORGE Wow.
ELAINE Jake, Jake. Take a look. Aaw, see, you're not the only one who has 'em. I have them too.
JAKE Where did you get those?
ELAINE Malaysia. I was in the area.
NEWMAN Kramer.
KRAMER Just drive.
KRAMER All right. Now you listen, and you listen good. I know who you are. You're the scofflaw.
NEWMAN What're you talking about...
KRAMER Ah, don't play dumb. It's me, Cosmo.
NEWMAN All right, so it's me. So what?
KRAMER You don't think I know how you're feeling, every second of the day? Looking over your shoulder to see if someone's coming up from behind. Sitting alone at night, knowing they could be closing in.
NEWMAN I can't sleep, I tell you! I can't sleep!
KRAMER Ga, of course you can't, you poor sap! Now why didn't you tell me?
NEWMAN I couldn't. I couldn't tell anyone.
KRAMER So you been living this secret the whole time by yourself?
NEWMAN Yes, it's been awful. I wanted to tell somebody. Help me Kramer! Help me!
KRAMER All right, all right, I'm gonna help you.
GEORGE I'll try some on and see how they look. It's just hair.
JERRY You ever see what that thing looks like in the back? You got your natural little curls on the bottom, and then that big phony mat coming down on top of 'em.
GEORGE Well, some of 'em look good. The ones that look good you don't even know about.
JERRY What if you get involved with a woman? How're you gonna tell her?
GEORGE The way they make 'em these days, I'll never have to tell her.
JERRY So you keep it a secret your whole life, then at your funeral the mortician comes out 'Here, Mrs Costanza, I thought you might want this'. Aahh!
LIPPMAN It's no secret that it's my dream to have my own publishing house, and if this Jake Jarmel book does, you know, what I think it's gonna do. If I can get this whole thing off the ground, then , you know, I think I'll have something for you.
ELAINE Oh, Mr Lippman. That is so exciting. I mean, you have no idea how sick I am of running around town looking for socks.
LIPPMAN Yeah, by the way, those are great glasses.
ELAINE Oh really, you like 'em?
LIPPMAN Uh huh. Very unusual.
ELAINE Well, you know what?
LIPPMAN What?
ELAINE You can have 'em.
LIPPMAN Oh, no no no. Please.
ELAINE No no no no. Go to that place on the corner, they'll change the prescription in an hour. Take 'em.
LIPPMAN Really?
ELAINE Yeah, I've no use for them anymore. Honestly.
LIPPMAN I could use a new pair of reading glasses.
ELAINE They're from Malaysia.
LIPPMAN Oh yeah?
ELAINE Fabulous.
JUDGE Well Mr Newman, in all my years on the bench, I have never come across anything quite like this. I have given this matter some very serious consideration and I've decided that what's best for the city and possibly for yourself, is for you to keep your car, in a garage...
JUDGE ...convenient to your home.
NEWMAN I can't afford that!
JUDGE Afford it you will, Mr Newman. Or this court will see that your car is impounded...
JUDGE ...and sold at auction.
KRAMER Well, don't you worry, your honour. He's in my custody.
GEORGE Well, what d'you think?
JERRY I, really can't say.
GEORGE No, say. I want you to say.
JERRY It's not good, okay. It's not good. You look stupid. I'm sorry.
SALESMAN You have to realise this has not been custom-fitted to his scalp.
GEORGE I really think this looks pretty good.
JERRY Why don't you get a pair of white shoes, move down to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with?
GEORGE Well, maybe you could show me something else.
SALESMAN As I said, it'll be different once we design something specifically for you. But I don't think your friend here is being very helpful.
JERRY Oh, hey, I'm being helpful. I am the only one being helpful!
SALESMAN No, I don't think you're being helpful! I think you're being disruptive, and you make it very difficult for your friend here to improve his life!
JERRY Hey! I'm trying to prevent my friend from becoming one of those guys people snicker at behind their back, because they look ridiculous! No offence to you personally!
SALESMAN All you people with hair think you're so damn superior! You have no idea what it's like. You ever look down in the bottom of your tub and see a fist fulla hair? How'd you like to start your day with that?!
JERRY All right! Take it easy! Take it easy.
GEORGE Jerry!
JERRY I'm sorry.
GEORGE Please.
GARY Hey Jerry, th... George, you decided to get a rug! Good for you, Jack!
GEORGE Well, I'm, I'm just looking.
GARY Oh. Uh, Tommy, I'm gonna need a little adjustment.
SALESMAN I'll be right with you.
GARY Listen, George, I got some bad news. I'm not gonna be able to give you that parking space.
GEORGE What?
JERRY What?
GARY This judge has to use it for some scofflaw. And you know you can't fight City Hall.
JERRY You know, Gary I had a little chat with George the other day...
GARY You didn't?!
GEORGE I did.
JERRY ...and he told me that that...
GARY I'm not a hundred percent recovered yet!
JERRY Gimme that thing!
GEORGE How's your life? All right?
WOMAN Yeah, not bad at all.
LIPPMAN And now, uh, ladies and gentlemen of the press, it is my pleasure to introduce you to Mr Jake Jarmel.
REPORTER So Jake, what's your percentage on this book?
LIPPMAN Oh, actually I, uh, I have some very interesting information on that. You know, uh, this is a co-venture and as...
JAKE Where did you get those?
LIPPMAN ... as such, it...
JAKE Those glasses, where did you get those glasses?
LIPPMAN Where... what?
JAKE Is this supposed to be some kind of a joke on me? Because it's not very funny. Give me those! I want the glasses! Give me those!
ELAINE 'Scuse me. Have to go look for some socks.
JERRY Men flip around the television more than women, I think. Men get that remote control in their hands, they don't even know what the hell they're watching. You know, we just keep going, "Rerun, don't wanna watch it.. " "What are you watching?" "I don't care, I gotta keep going." "Who was that?" "I don't know what it was - doesn't matter, it's not your fault. It doesn't matter, I gotta keep going." Women don't do this. See now, women will stop and go, "Well, let me see what the show is before I change the channel." You see? Men just fly. Because women, you see, women nest and men hunt. That's why we watch TV differently. Before there was flipping around, before there was television, kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had story-tellers that would tell them stories 'cause that was their entertainment. I always wonder, in that era, if they would get, like, thirty story-tellers together so they could still flip around. Just go, "Alright start telling me a story, what's happening? I don't want to hear anymore. Shut up. Go to the next guy. What are you talking about? Is there a girl in that story? ..No? Shut up. Go to the next guy. What do you got? I don't want to hear that either. Shut up. No, go ahead, what are you talking about?.. I don't want to hear that. No, the all of you, get out of here. I'm going to bed."
GEORGE She's pregnant? Leslie is pregnant?! Oh, see, there is no justice.
JERRY She's the performance artist, right?
GEORGE Yeah, performance artist. She's a real performer. A real trooper.
JERRY What's her husband's name, again? Chip? Kip? Skip?
ELAINE Todd.
JERRY Todd. Oh yeah. He's a Kennedy.
ELAINE No, he's not.
JERRY C'mon. He's a third cousin, or something.
ELAINE By marriage.
JERRY Oh, by marriage. We went to their wedding. You should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame the whole thing on bad directions.
GEORGE That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life.
ELAINE Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, intelligent woman.
GEORGE What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent women?
JERRY Thin ice, George. Thin ice..
GEORGE Maybe for her new performance piece she'll give birth on stage.
ELAINE She stopped performing.
GEORGE Oh, what a huge blow to the culture.
JERRY You believe this guy? He holds a grudge like Khomeini.
GEORGE She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in Brooklin to see one of her "performances".
JERRY Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity?
GEORGE God! She's cooking dinner for God! She's yelling and screaming, and the next thing I know, she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red shirt.
ELAINE It was an accident!
GEORGE Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire! Then, for the rest of the show, I'm sitting there with chocolate all over my shirt. Flies are landing on me. I'm boiling - I'm fantasizing all the things I'm gonna say when I see her. And later, finally, backstage when I talk to her, I'm a groveling worm. "What kind of chocolate was that? Do you throw any other foods?"
JERRY he thought he still had a shot.
GEORGE And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else! Never even, never even said goodbye! Never called me back.. Never apologized. Nothing. Like I was dirt.
JERRY What ever happened with the shirt?
GEORGE I still have it. The collar's okay. I wear it under sweaters.
ELAINE I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her a baby shower.
JERRY Asked you? You're not going to do that are you?
ELAINE anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval.
GEORGE Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower.
JERRY Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for me.
GEORGE Ich bin ein sucker.
ELAINE Oh, would you two stop with the Kennedys? Why does everybody make such a big deal about he Kennedys? What is this fascination?! Who cares?! It's all so boring..
GEORGE She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby monsoon. She deserves Rosemary's baby!
ELAINE I do have one teeny little problem, though.
GEORGE Never said goodbye. Never apologized. Nothing.
ELAINE See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment..
JERRY But?
ELAINE My roommate has Lyme disease.
JERRY Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr Syndrome?
ELAINE She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. It's like Epstein-Barr with a twist of Lyme disease.
JERRY How did she get Lyme disease?
ELAINE I don't know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury, Connecticut.
JERRY They still do that play?
ELAINE It's a classic.
JERRY With all the nudity?
ELAINE I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in.
GEORGE Never said goodbye. Goodbye!
JERRY Explain to me how this baby shower thing works.
ELAINE What do you wanna know?
JERRY Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence?
ELAINE Rarely.
JERRY There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there?
ELAINE No.
JERRY When is this suppose to be?
ELAINE Saturday.
JERRY Saturday?.. Well, I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday. They're not gonna bust up my apartment, or anything, are they?
ELAINE I'll take full responsibility. You won't regret it.
JERRY 'Cause I've seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, and boom! And entire buffet is swept off the table.
GEORGE Someday, before I die, mark my words - I'm gonna tell that woman exactly what I think of her. I'll never be able to forgive myself until I do.
JERRY And if you do?
GEORGE I still won't be able to forgive myself - but at least it won't be about this.
KRAMER What are you doing this for? Look at you..
JERRY Quiet. I'm trying to get a picture.
KRAMER But you don't have to do this! This guy is waiting in my house.
JERRY Leave me alone.
KRAMER It's a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty bucks. Why live like this?!
JERRY I'm not getting illegal cable!
KRAMER Oh, so what are you gonna do? You gonna wait for the cable companies to resolve their dispute? They're gonna be in court for years.
JERRY No, I read in the paper..
KRAMER Oh, oh, the paper..
JERRY Well, they might hook us up again.
KRAMER Oh, God, you're so naive! All the cable companies care about is the "Big Mammoo." Oh, look at you! You're banging things.. Pathetic. Just wasting your life. I'm offering you fifty-six channels - movies, sports, nudity. And it's free! For life!
JERRY Stop shouting! You're ruining the reception.
KRAMER Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do you know what you're saying?!
JERRY What you're suggesting is illegal.
KRAMER It's not illegal.
JERRY It's against the law.
KRAMER Well, yeah.
JERRY Just, just, hold this. Can you hold that?
KRAMER Look, will you at least let me bring the guy over? He's an amazing man. He's a Russian immigrant. He escaped the Gulag. He's like the Sakharov of cable guys.. He'll slow down your gas meter. He sells slugs, Jerry. Slugs for the subway.
JERRY A real human rights nut, huh?
KRAMER Yeah. He's intense, man.
JERRY I don't know. What if I get caught?
KRAMER Oh, you're not gonna get caught. Look, let me get him. Man, it's the nineties, it's Hammer time! Come on, just let me get him.
JERRY You know, why don't we wait? Because, I'm going out of town tomarrow.
TABACHNICK Tomarrow okay.
KRAMER No problem. Yeah, you'll have the whole thing installed by the time you get back.
JERRY Every time I turn on the TV, sirens are gonna go off. They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know it..
KRAMER No, no, now look now, Jerry, Jerry, it's no risk. I swear. The Mets have seventy-five games on cable this year..
JERRY Put it in.
KRAMER You won't regret it. Jerry's gonna be a cable boy, a cable boy, a cable boy..
MAN Mr. Steinfeld?
JERRY Seinfeld.
MAN We're with the FBI. You wanna tell us about your cable hook-up?
JERRY My cable hook-up? What about it?
MAN It's been illegally installed, Mr. Steinfeld.
JERRY It has? I've been out of town. How did you know?
KRAMER Jerry, I had to tell them. I had to. I had no choice. They were onto the scam from the very beginning.
MAN You're in serious trouble, Mr. Steinfeld.
JERRY Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on! We're just patsies. We're just a couple of users.. We never sold the stuff. What about the Russian guy? The Russian guy is the guy you want.
TABACHNICK Mr. Seinfeld, Agent Stone. FBI. Undercover.
KRAMER No! Jerry! Cable boy, cable boy.. What have you done to my little cable boy?..
JERRY Excuse me. Can I get something to drink?
STEWARDESS I'm afraid not.
JERRY What's with this airline? What are you, cutting out the drinks now?
STEWARDESS No sir. We're flying into a blizzard. Please fasten your seat belt. We're making an emergency landing.
JERRY Are they gonna go over the instructions again?
BILL My name is Bill. I might be the last person you ever see.
JERRY I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear of flying and, I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying is quite rational because, human beings cannot fly. Humans have fear of flying same way fish have fear of driving. Put a fish behind the wheel, and they go, "This isn't right. I shouldn't be doing this. I don't belong here."
GEORGE Sounds like a rough trip.
JERRY Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. And then, when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed.
GEORGE So, the college cancelled the gig?
JERRY Well, there was so much snow. The roads were closed. I really appreciate it - you picking me up. Thanks again.
GEORGE Forget it.
JERRY No, really.. an airport run.
GEORGE It's nothing.
JERRY Hey, it's one thing if I asked you "Could you do me a favor?" ..But to suggest it?.. GEORGE: Whey you told me what you went through on the plane, it makes you stop and think. You appreciate having a real friend.
JERRY You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious, you know. He's always got some ulterior motive.
GEORGE ..Ulterior motive.
JERRY Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't take the bridge.. Get off here. We can't go back to my place, Elaine's having the shower.
GEORGE What, tonight? Now?
JERRY Yeah, yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright, it's no big deal. We'll just go back to your place.
GEORGE My place? NO, no, no. I hate my place. I don't wanna go back to my place.
JERRY You want to get a bite?
GEORGE Yeah, I would. It's just, you know, I just ate a whole pot roast.
JERRY Well, so what should we do?
GEORGE Shouldn't we at least drop off your bag?
JERRY Red shirt! Red shirt! That's the red shirt!
GEORGE What are you talking about?
JERRY You're wearing the chocolate shirt!
GEORGE I am? What a strange coincidence..
JERRY A - Ha! Nice try, my friend, but you gotta get up pretty early in the morning..
GEORGE You gotta let me go over there.
JERRY What are you gonna do? Badger a pregnant woman at her own baby shower?! What are you, gonna take it off and make her rinse it in club soda?
GEORGE No, I'm gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years, and I'm gonna say, "Remember this shirt, baby?! Well, now, it's payback time!"
LESLIE We just bought an apartment on Riverside Drive. Bernard Goetz's mother used to live there.
ELAINE So, where's Todd?
LESLIE Up in Hyannisport.
ELAINE Oh my God, Hyannisport? With the Kennedys? Who else is up there? Is Rose up there?!
WOMAN So, when's your due date?
LESLIE March twentieth, nine a.m.
WOMAN You know the time!
LESLIE I'm having a planned C-section. My therapist told me if I go through labor, I might get psychotic.
ELAINE Leslie, Leslie, whatever happened to Sargent Shriver? Is he still with them? You don't hear much about him these days. Is he out of the loop?
LESLIE Elaine, who catered this, Sears?
ELAINE What is this?! What are you doing here?
KRAMER We're putting in cable.
ELAINE The cable? No, no, no. I'm having a party here. You can't do this now!
KRAMER Oh, we have to do this now.
ELAINE Who's this guy?
KRAMER Which one?
ELAINE Both of the them.
KRAMER Oh, they're Soviet Cable guys.
ELAINE Okay.. Does Jerry know about this?
KRAMER Oh yeah.. it's all authorized, yeah.
ELAINE You can't! You can't do this now!
KRAMER Elaine, do you know how booked up this guy is? Now, if I send him away now, it's gonna take Jerry months to get him back.. He won't like that.
ELAINE Alright. Just do it fast and then get out.
KRAMER Anatoly! Look, it's gonna take a few minutes.. Then, you and the gals can take a load off and watch something on Lifetime.
JERRY And what if we go up there? What are you going to say to her?
GEORGE What am I going to say?!
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE What did you go out with me for?! Just to dump chocolate on my shirt and then just dump me altogether?! I don't deserve that kind of treatment! What, you don't have the common courtesy to return my calls?! To apologize! You think I'm some sort of a loser, that likes to be abused and ignored?! Who's shirt can be ruined without financial restitution?! Some sort of a masochist who enjoys being humiliated? You think you can avoid me like I have some sort of disease?! You have the disease! You have the disease! You may be beautiful and rich and physically .. just .. unbelievable, but you sicken me! You disgust me! You and everyone like you!
JERRY You'll never say that to her face.
GEORGE Watch me.
KRAMER Yeah, I eat the whole apple. The core, stem, seeds, everything.
ELAINE Kramer, Kramer, look at him. Look! He's eating all the food!
KRAMER Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, there are many differences between American and Soviet cultures that you're not aware of. See, in Russian, the cable guy, they got the whole run of the house. Yeah, that's tradition. Did you ever eat the bark of a pineapple?
ELAINE Kramer!
KRAMER Uh.. Excuse me..
ELAINE What are you doing here? I thought you were out of town for the weekend.
JERRY The show was cancelled. There was a blizzard.
ELAINE I can't believe you told Kramer it's okay to put the cable in during the shower! Jerry, look,, look! They've eaten everything.
LESLIE Jerry, what a surprise! I thought you sere out of town.
JERRY Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason.
ELAINE George, don't even think about it! Don't even dream about it!
GEORGE About what?
TABACHNICK Kramer, Kramer, Kramer..
GEORGE Leslie.
LESLIE Yeah?
GEORGE George.. George Costanza.
LESLIE Hi.
GEORGE You, I guess, you don't remember me.. but we actually, kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember?
LESLIE Vaguely.
GEORGE You took me to one of your shows..
LESLIE And?
GEORGE And, um, it was quite good. In fact, you even incorporated me into the show. I'm not actually a performer. Although, my parents felt I had talent..
MARY Jerry?! Remember me?
JERRY I'm sorry, I..
MARY Mary Contardi. No? Doesn't ring a bell, Jerry? We had a date, three years ago. You took me to one of your shows.
JERRY Oh, I, I, think I remember..
MARY Told me you had a great time! Said you'd call me the next day.
JERRY Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your..
MARY Liar! Liar! You were never going to call me! You thought you could waltz throught the rest of your life and never bump into me again! But you were wrong, Jerry! You were wrong! What do you think, I'm some sort of poor, pathetic wretch?!
JERRY No, I don't think that..
MARRY Some person who could be dismissed and ignored?! Some insignificant piece of dust?! Some person who doesn't deserve your respect and your attention?! You're the one that doesn't deserve my respect and my attention! You're the insignificant piece of dust!
GEORGE Actually, I never had any formal training. I guess I'd be better suited for improvs, or something..
LESLIE Thanks a lot!
ELAINE I'm sorry you have to go.
WOMAN Yeah. I really have to be going.
JERRY Alright, listen, I've changed my mind about this whole thing. I don't want cable.
KRAMER Don't be a fool.
TABACHNICK You don't want?
JERRY No, I don't want. So, just tell me what I owe you for your trouble..
TABACHNICK Four hundred dollars.
JERRY Four hundred dollars?1 You told me one-fifty!
LESLIE I'm going.. obviously.
ELAINE Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything that went on here tonight. You know, I had no idea..
LESLIE Elaine, you know, I was watching you tonight, and I realized something. You're just like you were in college.
ELAINE Oh, thank you. "Like you were in college"?
LESLIE Come on! Let's go!
GEORGE I'll be right back.
JERRY I'm not paying four hundred dollars! I don't even want the thing. What are you going to do?!
GEORGE Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control of my life. And yet, I want them all.. is that irony?
ELAINE Why can't I meet a Kennedy? ..I saw John Junior once downtown. I was on a bus. I hit the ding, but.. it didn't stop.
JERRY Alright, I said I had a good time and I'd call, but who takes that literally?
KRAMER Hey, come on over, Dr. Zhivago's on cable in five minutes.. I'm making popcorn!
JERRY What do you do at the end of a date when you know you don't want to see this person ever again, for the rest of your life? What do you say? What do you say? No matter what you say, it's a lie. "I'll see you around. See you around. If you're around, and I'm around, I'll see you around that area. You'll be around other people. You won't be around me. But you will be around." "Take care now." Did you ever say that to somebody? "Take care now. Take care, now. Because, I'm not going to be taking care of you. So, you should take care, now." "Take care. Take care." What does this mean? "Take off!" Isn't that what you really want to say? "Take off now."
JERRY ...cramped seat, working on a tiny computer; there's always a small problem "There'll be a slight delay, we'll be a little late, if you could be a little patient! We're just trying to get one of those little trucks to pull us up just a little closer to the jetway so you can walk down the narrow hallway and there'll be a man there in a tight suit and he'll tell you you have very little time to make your connecting flight. So move it!". Open with Jerry and Elaine in a car on their way to the airport. Elaine is singing a poppy Jazz tune.
ELAINE Bah bah baaah, Boo doo bah bah bah, boo doo waaaah, waah, waaaah...
JERRY Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you shut-up?
ELAINE Hey guess what? This window doesn't work.
JERRY I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works: the window doesn't work, the radio doesn't work... and it smells like a cheap hooker... Or is that you?
ELAINE Gimme ten bucks and find out...
JERRY So, this worked out pretty good. Them givin' me an extra ticket, y'know, you get a free trip to St. Louis, I did my gig, you got to see your sister...
ELAINE Yeah, worked out good.
JERRY And here's the beauty--
ELAINE What?
JERRY George is pickin' us up at the airport.
ELAINE Get out of here! Why?
JERRY You know that awning outside my building?
ELAINE Yeah...
JERRY He's always bragging about his vertical leap, so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldn't touch the awning.
ELAINE So what happened?
JERRY He didn't come within two feet of the thing. He's wavin at it... So, I told him if he picks us up at the airport, he wouldn't have to pay me anything.
ELAINE Hey, how we doin' on time?
JERRY Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane... Oops.
ELAINE Hey! Wait up!
JERRY Hey! Wait up!
DRIVER Sorry. Heh heh heh...
SKYCAP Where you goin'?
JERRY Uh, JFK. I need some small bills for a tip. You got anything?
ELAINE Yeah, you want five?
JERRY Gimme ten.
ELAINE You're giving him ten dollars?
JERRY Well, we got three bags.
ELAINE That's a pretty big tip...
JERRY That's what they get!
ELAINE They don't get that much.
JERRY Let's ask him.
ELAINE We can't ask him...
JERRY Let's see what he says.
ELAINE Jerry, we don't have time for this...
JERRY Two seconds. Excuse me, my friend and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip.
SKYCAP Depends on the person, depends on the bag.
JERRY Uh, how about a couple of people like us.
SKYCAP People like you? I wouldn't expect much, you don't even look like you know what you're doing...
JERRY C'mon, seriously...
SKYCAP Well, since you asked, usually, I get five dollars a bag. What!?
ELAINE What!?
SKYCAP That's right. Five bucks a bag?
ELAINE Five dollars a bag? I don't think so.
SKYCAP Look, you asked, I told you.
ELAINE You got some nerve trying to take advantage of us...
JERRY All right, look, we're late. Thank you very much...
ELAINE You're lucky I don't report you...
SKYCAP JFK, Honolulu.
ELAINE Wait up!
JERRY You see? Never be late for a plane with a girl. 'Cuz a girl runs like a girl-- with the little steps and the arms flailing out... You wanna make this plane, you've gotta run like a man! Get your knees up!
JERRY_AND_ELAINE The flight's been canceled?!?!
TICKET_LADY Everything into JFK's booked... No, wait-- I have two seats into Laguardia-- but they're not together. It's boarding right now.
JERRY We'll take 'em!
ELAINE We're not going to sit together?
JERRY Well, so what? It's not that long-- you'll read.
ELAINE Well, what about George? He's supposed to pick us up at Kennedy.
JERRY We'll call him...
ELAINE There's no time.
JERRY No time? Is there time?
TICKET_LADY There's no time.
JERRY There's no time. All right, we'll call him from the plane.
TICKET_LADY I have one seat in first class, and one in coach. The price is the same since your flight was canceled.
JERRY I'll take the first class.
ELAINE Jerry!
JERRY What?
ELAINE Why should you get the first class?
JERRY Elaine, have you ever flown first class?
ELAINE No.
JERRY All right then. See? You won't know what you're missing. I've flown first class, Elaine-- I can't go back to coach. I can't... I won't...
ELAINE You flew here coach.
JERRY Yeah, that's a point...
ELAINE All right, fine. I don't care. If the plane crashes, everybody in first class is going to die, anyway.
JERRY Yeah, I'm sure you'll live.
ATTENDANT_1 Third row right...
ATTENDANT_1 Oh, you're in here, sir. Welcome aboard.
JERRY Bon voyage, Lainey!
PASSENGER_1 Oh, excuse me... Um, excuse me, miss, I think you're sitting in my seat...
PASSENGER_1 I never check my bags-- I can't stand that wait in the baggage area.
ELAINE Great... Help me...
TIA Excuse me, I think you're in my seat...
JERRY Oh, sorry... My mistake... Thank... you!
GEORGE Hey, thanks for coming with me.
KRAMER Hey, what made you think you could touch that awning?
GEORGE I confused it with another awning.
KRAMER So how we doin' on time?
GEORGE We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal exactly 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking out of the terminal as we roll up. I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup.
GEORGE What's going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway? What are you getting on the Long Island Expressway for? Do you know what the traffic will be like? This is a suicide mission!
KRAMER Will you relax?!
GEORGE Oh, I had it perfectly timed out: the Grand Central, the Van Wyck! You destroyed my whole timing!
KRAMER This is the best way to go!
GEORGE Do you know what happens if I miss him? I don't get credit for the pickup and I lose my 50 bucks...
KRAMER George, there's no traffic at this time. Now, come on, man...
GEORGE Really?
KRAMER If anything, we'll probably get there early. I'll have a chance to go to the Duty Free shop.
GEORGE The Duty Free Shop? Duty Free is the biggest sucker deal in retail. Do you know how much duty is?
KRAMER Duty.
GEORGE Yeah, "duty". Do you know how much duty is?
KRAMER No, I dunno how much duty is.
GEORGE Duty is nothing. It's like sales tax...
KRAMER I still like to stop at the duty free shop.
GEORGE I like to stop at the duty free shop.
GEORGE_AND_KRAMER I like to stop at the duty free shop! I like to stop at the duty free shop!
TIA So, he says, "squeeze your breasts together", and I say, "I thought this was an ad for shoes"...
JERRY Oh my...
TIA Is that the new Esquire? Turn to page 146.
JERRY Wow! Coming out of the shower... It's a good thing they gave you that washcloth to cover yourself up... Um, what was that page number again?
JERRY What is this an ad for?
TIA See those wrinkled jeans slung over the chair? Way in the background, out of focus?
JERRY Uh-huh...
KRAMER How does it look on your side? We'll get there...
ELAINE Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful.
GEORGE They're not here! You cost me fifty bucks!
KRAMER Look at you! You run like a girl! Run like a man! Lift your knees!
GEORGE Look, we're wasting our time here! We're a half-hour late, they've probably took it off the board already.
KRAMER No, there it is, right there-- 133... and it's canceled.
GEORGE Canceled? Do I still get credit for the pick up? I was here!
KRAMER Ok, c'mon... let's go check over at the ticket counter.
GROSSBARD Oh, there it is honey, gate 18A, 8:30...
KRAMER Did you see that guy?
GEORGE No... What guy?
KRAMER That guy.. He was just...
GEORGE Listen, you go over to the ticket counter, I'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine. There's supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think he mentioned my name!
KRAMER I know that guy...
PRISONER Gotta get my Time magazine... Never miss my Time magazine.
GUARD Yeah, get your magazine and let's get out of here.
PRISONER Hey, I was gonna take that!
GEORGE Gee, I'm sorry... I got here first.
PRISONER I don't care when you got here, I want the magazine...
GEORGE You don't understand, there's a blurb about me in this magazine!
PRISONER A blurb?!? You're a blurb! Check out the cover, idiot!
GUARD All right, let's go...
PRISONER I want the magazine!
GEORGE Umm... No.
PRISONER You know what I would do to you, if I wasn't in these shackles...
GEORGE But you are Blanche... You are in the shackles. Oh, I can't wait to read my Time magazine! Laaaast copy, too. Maybe I'll read it tomorrow-- in the park! It's supposed to be a beeyootiful day! Have a nice life... sentence, that is!
KRAMER They're on a different flight. They're scheduled to land in a half hour, only at Laguardia.
GEORGE Laguardia? All right, let's go. C'mon...
KRAMER Where do I know that guy from?
ELAINE Wake up, you human slug! Wake up! Wake up!! I can't hold it anymore! Excuse me, I've gotta go to the bathroom...
JERRY Oh my... that is refreshing...
ATTENDANT Would you care for some slippers?
JERRY Sounds lovely! May I?
TIA Please!
JERRY Why, It's a perfect fit. You must be Cinderella.
GEORGE My name is not mentioned in this blurb...
KRAMER It's Grossbard!
GEORGE Who's Grossbard?
KRAMER When I lived on Third avenue and 18th street 20 years ago, I had this roommate who was always behind in his rent. Then one month, he asks me to loan him his share of the rent-- 240 bucks! He took the cash and disappears. Well, I try to find him, I went to his girlfriend's house, even his family. Uh-uh. I never got the money back! He screwed me! And that's the guy-- John Grossbard!
GEORGE Hey Kramer, c'mon-- it was 240 bucks twenty years ago...
KRAMER No, I'm gonna turn around... I'm gonna get that guy...
GEORGE No-no-no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You cannot abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social contract. We... we must go forward... not back.
JERRY Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? It's like an English garden in there.
ATTENDANT They're gardenias, mostly.
JERRY I thought I smelled lilac.
ATTENDANT Yes, there are a few of those, too...
TIA It's almost overwhelming...
CAPTAIN Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Due to equipment problems at the runway at Laguardia, we've been instructed by the tower to re-route and land at JFK. We apologize for any inconvenience...
ELAINE What'd he say? What'd he say?
GEORGE Well, You're not gonna believe it...
KRAMER What?
GEORGE The plane's been re-routed back to Kennedy. We've got 45 minutes.
KRAMER Let's go. Listen to the bell, Grossbard-- it tolls for thee.
ATTENDANT We have some delicious Chateau Briande, my personal favourite. Or, if you prefer something lighter, a poached Dover sole in a delicate white wine sauce with just a hint of saffron.
JERRY Oh, saffron! That sounds good.
ATTENDANT And today we're featuring wines from the Tuscany region...
JERRY_AND_TIA Tuscany!
ELAINE Hi. Can I get to my seat?
ATTENDANT You're just gonna have to wait...
ELAINE But you just passed it. I'm sitting right there next to that guy...
ATTENDANT You're not supposed to get up during the food service.
ELAINE Well, nobody told me that!
ATTENDANT Look. This plane is full. I got a lot of people to serve. Now please... You're just gonna have to wait.
GEORGE There it is. Gate 46... We got plenty of time.
KRAMER Grossbard's plane leaves in ten minutes. I still got time to catch him!
GEORGE How you gonna catch him? He's probably boarded the plane already.
KRAMER Gimme your credit card.
GEORGE My credit card?
KRAMER Just gimme the card, don't ask me any questions.
GEORGE I'm not gonna give you my card unless you tell me what it's for!
KRAMER I'm gonna buy a ticket-- I'm gonna get on that flight.
GEORGE What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard.
KRAMER No, I'm not gonna use the ticket! I'm gonna get my money, I'll get off the plane and turn your ticket in for a refund. It's not gonna cost you a dime! Now gimme the card.
GEORGE This is a great idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer miles with every purchase... Wait! Get two tickets. As long as your turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get double the bonus miles.
ELAINE Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me get through. There's no way to get around that cart...
PASSENGER_1 You're not supposed to get up during the food service.
ELAINE I'll try and remember that. Where's my meal?
PASSENGER_1 He asked me where you were, and you were gone so long I thought you, uh, switched seats.
ELAINE Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal.
ATTENDANT Are you sure?
ELAINE Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me.
ATTENDANT Would you?
ATTENDANT Well, the only meal left is a kosher meal.
ELAINE Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is.
PASSENGER_1 I think it means when a Rabbi has inspected it, or something.
PASSENGER_2 No, no. It all has to do with the way they kill the pig.
PASSENGER_1 They don't eat pigs!
PASSENGER_2 They do if it's killed right-- under a Rabbi's supervision.
PASSENGER_3 Oh, You know what? I ordered the kosher meal.
ELAINE Then why didn't you take it?
PASSENGER_3 I ordered it six weeks ago, I forgot.
ELAINE You're eating my food!
ATTENDANT Look, I got earplugs to collect. Do you want it, or not.
TIA This is the best sundae I've ever had.
JERRY Oh, man. You know what... they got the fudge on the bottom-- y'see? That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're eatin' your ice cream.
TIA I've never met a man who knew so much about nothing.
JERRY Thank you...
ATTENDANT More anything?
JERRY More everything!
KRAMER Look, I got Super Savers! C'mon.
GEORGE Super Savers? Are they refundable!? You bought non-refundable tickets, you idiot!
KRAMER She talked me in to it-- she said it was the best deal.
GEORGE Do you know how much this is going to cost me?
KRAMER Look, I'll tell you what-- I'll split it with you
GEORGE Look, I'm gonna go to the bathroom...
ATTENDANT Excuse me... Excuuuse me...
ELAINE What? Oh, no... nothing for me thanks.
ATTENDANT What is your name?
ELAINE Elaine Benes?
ATTENDANT You're going to have to go back to coach.
ELAINE No, but there was nobody sitting here...
ATTENDANT Yes, but you're still not allowed. These seats are very expensive.
ELAINE Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me back there... Oh, you got cookies!
ATTENDANT You're going to have to go back to your seat!
ELAINE Ok, fine. I'll go back... You know, our goal should be a society without classes! Do you realise that the people up here are getting cookies!
JERRY What is all the racket back there? You know, you're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put up with. What is going on?
ATTENDANT Sir, this woman tried to sneak into first class.
JERRY Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is, that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking door.
KRAMER Hey! That guy owes me 240 bucks!
JERRY Couldn't be...
JERRY Where are they already? I don't see them anywhere...
JERRY I got my bags, I'm ready to go.
ELAINE Yeah, you got your bags...
ELAINE The worst flight I have been on in my entire life.
JERRY Yeah, me too...
TIA I'll call you.
JERRY Okay... It's a business thing...
KRAMER You guys ready?
JERRY Yeah. Where's George?
JERRY But I have to admit, I like flying. I like those little bathrooms that they have on the plane. It's kind of like a small apartment of your own on the plane. You go in, you close the door, the light comes on. It's like a small surprise party every time you go in there. The worst way of flying, I think is "standby", you ever fly standby? It never works, you know, that's why they call it standby-- you stand there going "Bye!" So I was on this flight where the flight attendant-- it was her first day on the job so they didn't have a uniform for her yet, and that really... makes a big difference, I mean this is just some regular person coming over to you going "Would you mind bringing your seat back all the way up?" It's like, "Who the Hell are you?!"
JENNA Morning.
JERRY Morning.
JENNA Hope you don't mind baking soda flavour.
JERRY Ah, baking soda. Annoying little product. 'I can do this. I can do that.' Why doesn't this stuff just shut up?
JENNA I'm gonna grab you a towel.
JERRY Ooh-ooh
GEORGE So?
JERRY So? She used the toothbrush!
GEORGE You said you grabbed it outta there real fast, right?
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE So I'm sure whatever germs it landed on were knocked out, and by the time the rest of them realised what was going on, you had already grabbed it out.
JERRY How many years of med school did you have?
GEORGE Was she mad?
GEORGE You didn't tell her.
JERRY Jenna's like me. She's very...
GEORGE Finicky? Prissy? Fastidious?
JERRY I'll take fastidious.
JERRY What is that?
GEORGE Ahh, Steinbrenner gave 'em to us, in honour of Phil Rizzuto being inducted into the Hall of Fame.
HEAD Holy cow!
JERRY They don't actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say 'holy cow', do they?
GEORGE Just the last few innings of a double-header.
KRAMER Hey. Look at this. I'm in the passing lane of the Arthur Berkhardt expressway, going seventy and Dragged this thing for five exits.
JERRY Why didn't you pull over?
KRAMER Well I was draughting behind a semi. I didn't wanna lose him. The infrastructure, Jerry, it's crumbling.
HEAD Holy cow!
KRAMER Well, look at that. A talking Nixon.
OWNER China Panda.
ELAINE Yeah, I'd like to place an order.
OWNER Ah yes, what you like?
ELAINE This Supreme Flounder, it says first time served in America. Is that true?
OWNER What number?
ELAINE Forty-seven.
OWNER Yeah, first time. What else?
ELAINE Uh, that's it.
OWNER Address?
ELAINE Seventy-eight, West Eighty-sixth Street. Apartment three E.
OWNER That's southside. Sorry, we don't deliver below Eighty-sixth.
ELAINE I'm not below.
OWNER Yes you are. Street itself is boundary.
ELAINE Your guy can't cross to my side?
OWNER If we deliver to you, then what? Eighty-fifth Street, Wall Street, Mexico, Eighty-fourth Street.
ELAINE Alright, fine. I'll just cross and meet him.
OWNER Sorry, food only for those who live within boundary.
OWNER China Panda.
ELAINE Uh, yeah yeah. I'd like to place an order.
OWNER Ah, what you like?
KRAMER Well, I'm a poppa.
JERRY Bring it on. Nothing's throwing me at this point.
KRAMER Well, as of today I am a proud parent of a one-mile stretch of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway.
JERRY Oh, that adopt-a-highway thing.
KRAMER Yeah, I'm part of the solution now Jerry. Yeah, I went down there and I checked it out this morning. Here, take a look. Mile one-fourteen.
JERRY Aw, looks just like you.
KRAMER Aw, I'm beaming Jerry.
JERRY So what d'you have to do? Pay to keep it clean?
KRAMER They try to push you into using their cleaning crew, with all their so-called maintenance equipment.
JERRY That old scam.
KRAMER Yeah, well that's why I'm doing it all myself. This parenting isn't about delegating responsibility, it's about being there.
JERRY At the side of the road, with a pile of garbage.
KRAMER Quality time.
GEORGE Keys. I can't find my keys.
JERRY You lost Phil Rizzuto's head?!
GEORGE Have you seen 'em?
JERRY No.
GEORGE Dammit!
KRAMER C'mon, retrace your steps. What d'you do today?
GEORGE I got up, I was supposed to go to work, I came here instead.
KRAMER Right.
JERRY Well, they're not here. You'll have to dig up your spare set.
GEORGE I don't have a spare set. All my keys say 'do not duplicate'.
JERRY So?
GEORGE So you can't duplicate 'em.
KRAMER Sure you can. Such a sweet kid.
ELAINE Oh. Oh, hi. China Panda?
DELIVERY_BOY Why you waiting on the street and not in your apartment?
ELAINE I... thought that I would meet you halfway.
DELIVERY_BOY You really live here?
ELAINE Oh yeah. There you go, keep the change. Bye now. I'll see you.
ELAINE This isn't fair. This is address discrimination!
JERRY Well, I cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf.
GEORGE So the plan is to secretly sterilise her mouth?
JERRY By the time I'm through with her mouth, she'll be able to eat off it. Is it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it?
GEORGE No, stings the throat. Anyway, so I was coming along here, and I felt like a piece of cake, you know? But then I thought, it's morning, I should really have a muffin. I like those chocolate chip ones. Then I figured, well, they're really both cake. So I, uh, I sat on that bench for a little while, twenty minutes or an hour, and then I figured, check and see what you were up to. Wait a minute, wait a minute. The broad jump! The broad jump over the pothole on Eighty-sixth Street!
GEORGE Now I remember, as I jumped over the hole I heard a, like a jingling sound.
JERRY You didn't look down?
GEORGE I was trying to stick the landing. ...was right around here.
GEORGE No! No!!
HEAD Holy, Holy Cow!
JERRY Poor son of a bitch.
JERRY It's a hundred thousand revolutions a second. It's the most powerful one they make.
JENNA It's like I'm holding a blender.
JERRY The engine's made by McDonnell-Douglas.
JERRY Oh no, you keep going. It shuts off automatically.
JENNA Really, it does?
JERRY When the battery runs out.
JENNA I was really happy with my old toothbrush.
JERRY No, trust me, that one was doing more harm than good. Don't forget to use the Plax too.
JENNA That stuff tastes like bleach!
JERRY I don't know anything about that.
JENNA Mmm. My mouth feels so clean.
JERRY That's the idea.
JERRY You know, maybe we better not. I, I think I'm getting a little cold. I don't wanna give you any of my germs.
JENNA Aww. Okay. Thanks, I guess.
ELAINE You still couldn't kiss her?
JERRY She has a taint. I can't see it, but I know it's there.
ELAINE Oh, so now you're finding fault on a sub-atomic level.
JERRY Maybe if I could shrink myself down, like in Fantastic Voyage, and get inside a microscopic submarine, I could be sure. Although if there was something there, it might be pretty scary. Course, I would have that laser.
ELAINE Jer, do you see where this is going?
JERRY Being really clean and happy?
ELAINE Jerry, you have tendencies. They're always annoying, but they were just tendencies. But now, if you can't kiss this girl, I'm afraid we're talking disorder.
JERRY Disorder?
ELAINE And from disorder, you're a quirk or two away from full-on dementia.
JERRY Hmm, that could hurt me. Hey, there it is.
ELAINE Shall we stop and say hi?
JERRY Nah, we've seen it.
ELAINE Yeah.
KRAMER Hey Jerry! Yeah, I'll see you back at the house!
KRAMER Mile one-fourteen, clean as a whistle.
MAN Yeah?
ELAINE Hi. I'm your neighbour, uh, fr... from across the street. And uh, I was wondering, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, if I could use your apartment to order some food?
MAN Wha? What d'you want?
ELAINE You see, there's this certain flounder and they won't deliver it to my side of the street.
MAN Wh, when is that?
ELAINE No, I just need them to deliver it here and I have to be kinda inside is all.
MAN Who are you with?
ELAINE No, actually I'm... I'm just kind of hungry.
MAN Who let you in?
ELAINE Well, the lock was broken. You just have to jiggle it, actually. But, I just need like a half an hour to an hour.
JERRY What's with the signs?
KRAMER Hey, you should see the Berkhardt, Jerry. My mile is spotless. I mean the big stuff was easy. Cinderblocks, air-conditioners, shopping carts , I just rolled 'em into the woods.
JERRY Yeah, that stuff's all natural anyway.
KRAMER Speed limit, one hundred and sixty-five miles per hour. See? They slipped a one in there. Those kids with the spray paint, God love 'em.
JERRY Hey. So, keys?
GEORGE No keys. And I been calling the city all day. Course there's not really a number to call if you wanna make a pothole.
JERRY I guess they leave that up to the general population.
GEORGE I tell you this. If the real Phil Rizzuto was down there, this wouldn't be happening!
JERRY Hard to say.
KRAMER Hey, you need some roadwork done? 'Cos I met some maintenance guys today on the highway, they could probably help you out.
GEORGE Really?
KRAMER Oh yeah, yeah. I borrowed some cones from them when I was sweeping my car-pool lane.
JERRY Yeah?
JENNA It's Jenna.
JERRY If you guys wouldn't mind, I would like to ward off dementia.
GEORGE You think you could hook me up with these guys?
KRAMER Oh yeah, yeah. Give me a ring tomorrow. I'm gonna be at emergency callbox seven-eight-four.
GEORGE Seven-eight-four. Jenna enters.
JENNA Hey.
JERRY Hi.
JENNA How you feeling?
JERRY Good. My cold's gone, and I've been looking forwards to kissing you, which I'm ready to do now, if you are ready.
JENNA What?!
JERRY Nothing. I just, I uh, I bruised my lip. I was drinking a Celray, and I brought it up too fast and I banged it into my lip, and then I knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and I wasn't able to tell you before you could use it.
JENNA What?
JERRY I'm sorry.
JENNA When were you gonna tell me this?!
JERRY Obviously never.
KRAMER I need the yield sign.
JERRY Kramer, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Would you get these signs out of here, please?
KRAMER You could've introduced me.
JERRY I wouldn't know where to start.
JERRY Hey, Jenna. Hey!
JENNA There. Now something of yours has been in the toilet.
JERRY What?! Wha... what'd you put in there?
JENNA Gotta run.
JERRY Oh, man!
JERRY Hello, Jenna, did you dunk the spatula? Was it the spatula? Hello? Dammit!
ELAINE She won't even give you a hint?
JERRY No. Could be anything. The whole apartment's a biohazard.
ELAINE You know what I bet it is? Your remote.
JERRY Yes, that is a definite possibility.
ELAINE Or, could be your walkman there.
JERRY Are you just screwing with me?
ELAINE Yeah, I am.
KRAMER Hey ah.
JERRY Hey, how's life on the road?
KRAMER Oh, I'm making a difference Jerry.
JERRY I don't doubt it.
KRAMER You should see the smiles on the drivers' faces. I mean, you gotta look quick, but they're there.
JERRY What's this?
KRAMER Well, you know, those annoying little bumps on the lane-lines?
JERRY Isn't that some kind of safety thing?
KRAMER Well, I had to pull 'em up if I'm gonna widen the lanes.
JERRY What the hell are you talking about?
KRAMER Ah, you know how in planes they got first class? More leg room, better ride? Well, I'm bringing that concept to mile one-fourteen.
ELAINE How are you gonna widen the lanes?
KRAMER Well you black out lane-lines one and three, and a four-lane highway becomes a two-lane comfort cruise. So, you got any black paint?
JERRY Yeah, in my toolshed, next to the riding mower.
ELAINE Yuh, I'd like an order of supreme flounder, number forty-seven. Yeah, apartment one-Q.
JERRY One-Q? Whose apartment is that?
ELAINE That's the janitor closet, across the street.
JERRY You're pretending to live in a janitor's closet, just to get this flounder?
ELAINE It's better than eating it alone in the restaurant, like some loser.
KRAMER That stuff is unbelievable. I'd eat it out of a dumpster.
ELAINE How do you know about it? You're not in the delivery zone.
KRAMER Well, Newman uses his mail truck to run fish for China Panda on the weekends.
ELAINE Well, mine's coming in ten, so... see you boys. Elaine leaves.
KRAMER Now, where's that tool shed of yours?
ELAINE Hi. Sorry, I didn't hear you. I was in the shower.
ELAINE I'll see you.
RALPH You Costanza?
GEORGE Yeah. Thanks for, thanks for coming by fellas. Eh, got a set of keys, buried in the pothole.
RALPH What're the keys doing in there?
GEORGE Just need to uh, to dig 'em up.
RALPH You put 'em in there?
GEORGE Nah, nah, it's uh, it's a long story. Just uh, try to get it up.
RALPH Bad place to put your keys.
GEORGE Yeah, I know that. Could you start, working?
RALPH Difficult job. You want those keys, we're gonna have to dig this up.
GEORGE Oh, uh, wait a minute, wait a minute. Is this about money?
RALPH Yeah. It's about money.
MRS_ALLISTER 'Scuse me, what are you doing in there?
ELAINE Uhm, nothing. I was just uhm... I wasn't in there.
MRS_ALLISTER You were hanging around in there, lazing on the job. When you shoulda been downstairs in the basement, cleaning out those old carpets and scrap wood.
ELAINE Right, because... I'm the janitor.
MRS_ALLISTER Don't get smart with me.
ELAINE Yes ma'am.
RADIO Hey, and if you're heading north on the Arthur Berkhardt, whoah Nelly, for some reason four lanes are converging into two, instantaneously right at mile-marker one-fourteen. I don't know what that is, but the A-B's a parking lot out there. Somebody screwed up on that one.
ELAINE Oh it's you.
JERRY Is the flounder here yet?
ELAINE No, it's not here yet. You want the tour?
ELAINE There's this.
JERRY Nice. French doors'd really open this place up. Oh, but you have a slop-bucket.
ELAINE The fish!
ELAINE Ah, what're you doing here?
GEORGE Hey.
JERRY Hey.
GEORGE Oh, I was uh, I was waiting downstairs for the jackhammer, thought I'd drop by.
JERRY Kramer's guys?
GEORGE Yeah. I got 'em down to fifty bucks. I just have to do all the jackhammering myself.
JERRY Oh that's nice, kind of a hard-labour fantasy camp.
GEORGE Ow!
ELAINE Uh, man!
KRAMER Huh, yeah. Oh, sweet setup. Elaine, d'you have any paint thinner? I need like uh, forty gallons.
ELAINE I'm plumb out.
KRAMER Oh man, if I don't get that black paint off the City's gonna go ape. I don't wanna lose my baby!
MRS_ALLISTER Janitor?
ELAINE Uh, Mrs Allister. Yeah, uh, just coming Mrs Allister. Okay, I've gotta get out.
ELAINE Here, can you move, you gotta move from the door.
ELAINE Hi, I uhm... What can I do for you?
MRS_ALLISTER I told you yesterday to haul that trash outta the basement.
ELAINE Yeah, I am so sorry.
MRS_ALLISTER Some of the children have been playing near it and putting it in their mouths.
ELAINE Well, a lot of it is vegetable...
MRS_ALLISTER Get that stuff outta there today, or you'll be outta here. Understand?
ELAINE Yes ma'am.
GEORGE ...stop pushing. Kramer spilled ammonia.
JERRY I don't feel like eating.
KRAMER I'm gonna borrow this, huh?
ELAINE Janitor's meeting.
JENNA So Jerry, why'd you call me?
JERRY Well, I thought it's about time we put aside all this silliness. I know now you didn't put anything in my toilet bowl. Did you?
JENNA Yes, I did.
JERRY Well, whatever. So, how've you been?
JENNA Good.
JERRY Good. Steak knife?
JENNA Just eating away at you isn't it?
JERRY Nah.
ELAINE Hi.
JENNA Hi.
JERRY Hi.
ELAINE Hi. Jerry, can I borrow your car?
JERRY For what?
ELAINE I have to haul some dirty garbage to the dump.
JERRY Dirt? That's alright, because there's nothing wrong with dirt.
ELAINE Well, actually it's pretty grimy.
JERRY Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze. Whatever it is, you take that stuff and put it right on my leather upholstery.
ELAINE Well, I don't know who you are, but thanks for the car.
JERRY Sure. Bye.
ELAINE Bye.
JENNA Bye.
ELAINE Bye.
JERRY There, you see? I just leant her my car, and she's gonna fill it with all sorts of... Alright! You win! That car was my last germ-free sanctuary. I slept there last night! Now, for the love of God, please, what is it? What is it?!
JENNA Toilet brush.
JERRY Toilet brush, oh . Alright, I can replace that.
JENNA You wanna order dinner?
JERRY Yeah. Let's uh, go to your place. Because I, threw out all my dishes.
JERRY That's true.
JENNA Mm.
JERRY But, I'll tell you this much. I am never going to let some silly hygienic mishap get in the way of, what could be, a meaningful, long-lasting relationship.
JENNA Do you hear something?
JERRY I don't know what that could be.
HEAD Holy cow!
JERRY Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future. Clean, dirty, whatever.
JERRY Holy cow! Have a nice life.
ELAINE Hey, look at this. Wide lanes. This is so luxurious. Woo, yeah.
KRAMER Bugger!
NEWMAN You're once. Twice. Three times a lady.
NEWMAN What the hell was that?
KRAMER Double bugger!
NEWMAN Yes, you're once. Twice. Three times...
NEWMAN Aaah! Aaagh! Aah-aah. Oh, oh the humanity! Aaagh!
KRAMER Hey buddy. What're you doing out here?
KRAMER Man, did you see that fireball? Woo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo.
KRAMER Hey, I gotta skedaddle. You wanna lift?
KRAMER Newman! Newman!!
KRAMER Well, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
KRAMER Mmmm, this is pretty good chow, huh?
GEORGE Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that's it. I realize we're prisoners, but we're still entitled to catsup.
ELAINE I guess we could've called for help.
JERRY But then we would have missed the whole thing.
KRAMER I still had it on video. We could have watched it later.
GEORGE Yeah, he's right.
JERRY I forgot about the video.
ELAINE Sure - the video.
ELAINE What is that?
JERRY Plane's ready.
RIVERA Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera. Tonight we'll be talking about what most of you have probably been discussing in your homes, and around the water coolers in your offices. I am speaking of course of the controversial Good Samaritan trial that gets underway Thursday in Latham, Massachusetts. Now before we meet our distinguished panel, let's go to Latham live, where Jane Wells is standing by. Jane-
WELLS Yes. Good evening, Geraldo.
RIVERA What's the mood? What's going on tonight?
WELLS Well, Latham is fairly quite tonight, considering the media circus that has descended upon this quaint little town.
RIVERA And what about the defendants - the so-called New York Four. How are they holding up?
WELLS Well, I did speak with one of the deputies who had some contact with them, and he told me quote "There's no love lost with that group."
RIVERA Anything else, Jane?
WELLS There also seems to be some friction between Mr. Seinfeld, and Ms. Benes. The rumor is that they once dated, and it's possible that ended badly.
RIVERA Well, ladies and gentlemen, who know, maybe this trial will bring them closer together. Maybe they'll even end up getting married.
HELEN I hope you packed enough - this trial could last for weeks.
MORTY What's all that?
HELEN Cereal.
MORTY You're packing cereal?
HELEN I'm bringing it for Jerry.
MORTY You got enough here for a life sentence.
HELEN He likes it. He says he misses that more that anything.
MORTY So bring a snack-pack.
ESTELLE Poor Georgie, was it our fault this happened to him? Did we do something wrong? Maybe it was our fault.
FRANK Maybe it was your fault. It wasn't my fault. I can tell you that.
ESTELLE Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours.
FRANK You were the one who smothered him.
ESTELLE I did not smother him.
FRANK You smothered! He couldn't get any air! He couldn't breathe! He was suffocating!
ESTELLE Sure, and you were always in Korea with your religious chachkis.
FRANK I had to make a living!
KRAMER This is excellent huh? Don't worry I didn't use too much milk, cause I know we gotta make it last.
JERRY You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment.
KRAMER I bet.
JERRY It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
CHILES Good morning.
ELAINE Good morning, Jackie.
JERRY Good morning.
CHILES Is everybody ready? Didn't I tell you I wanted you to wear the cardigan?
GEORGE It makes me look older.
CHILES Look older? Do you think this is a game? Is that what you think this is? I'm trying to give you amoral compass. You have no moral compass. You're going to walk into that courtroom, and the jury's going to see a mean, nasty, evil George Costanza. I want them to see Perry Como. No one's going to convict Perry Como. Perry Como helps out a fat tub who's getting robbed.
CHILES Do you think it's funny?
JERRY No.
CHILES You damn right it isn't. You better not be carrying on laughing in that courtroom, funny man. Cause if you start getting all smart-alecky, making wisecracks, acting a fool, you gonna find yourself in here for a long, long time. I don't like that tie. Suzie, get one of my ties from my briefcase.
ELAINE How do I look, Jackie?
CHILES Oh, you looking good. You look strong. You one fine-looking sexy lady.
ELAINE Thank you, Jackie.
KRAMER How bout me, Jackie?
CHILES Kramer, you always look good. You got respect for yourself. You're genuine. Jury's going to pick up on that.
CHILES Here.
JERRY This one?
CHILES That's right.
JERRY Do I have to?
ELAINE Jackie says put it on, Jerry.
BAILIFF All rise. Fourth District County Court, Latham, Massachusetts is now in session. The Honorable Judge Arthur Vandelay presiding.
GEORGE Vandelay? The judge's name is Vandelay?
CHILES Vanda who?
GEORGE Jerry, did you hear that?
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE I think that's a good sign.
VANDELAY Is the District Attorney ready to proceed?
HOYT We are, Your Honor.
VANDELAY Mr. Hoyt.
HOYT Ladies and gentlemen, last year, our City Council by a vote of twelve to two, passed a Good Samaritan Law. Now, essentially, we made it a crime to ignore a fellow human being in trouble. Now this group from New York not only ignored, but, as we will prove, they actually mocked the victim as he was being robbed at gunpoint. I can guarantee you one other thing, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time they have behaved in this manner. On the contrary, they have quite a record of mocking and maligning. This is a history of selfishness, self-absorption, immaturity, and greed. And you will see how everyone who has come into contact with these four individuals has been abused, wronged, deceived and betrayed. This time, they have gone too far. This time they are going to be held accountable. This time, they are the ones who will pay.
VANDELAY Mr. Chiles.
CHILES I am shocked and chagrined, mortified and stupefied. This trial is outrageous! It is a waste of the taxpayers' time and money. It is a travesty of justice that these four people have been incarcerated while the real perpetrator is walking around laughing - lying and laughing, laughing and lying. You know what these four people were? They were innocentbystanders. Now, you just think about that term. Innocent. Bystanders. Because that's exactly what they were. We know theywere bystanders, nobody's disputing that. So how can a bystander be guilty? No such thing. Have you ever heard of a guilty bystander? No, because you cannot be a bystander and be guilty. Bystanders are by definition, innocent. That is the nature of bystanding. But no, they want to change nature here. They want to create a whole new animal - the guilty bystander. Don't you let them do it. Only you can stop them.
VANDELAY Is the prosecution ready to present its first witness?
HOYT We are, Your Honor. Call Officer Matt Vogel to the stand.
BAILIFF Call Matt Vogel.
HOYT So they were just standing there?
VOGEL Yes.
HOYT Did one of them have a video camera?
VOGEL Yes.
HOYT Your Honor, with the court's permission, we would like to play back that video and enter it into evidence as Exhibit A.
VANDELAY Proceed.
VICTIM Don't shoot.
JERRY Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
ELAINE See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. They can't really chase ya!
GEORGE He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food. the victim of the robbery
HOYT So they just stood there and did nothing?
VICTIM Yeah, nothing. Nothing!
HOYT No further questions.
GEORGE Hey! Great plane! Thanks a lot. Piece of junk. You know you almost got us killed!
HOYT Call Mabel Choate to the stand.
BAILIFF Call Mabel Choate.
CHILES Your Honor. I most strenuously and vigorously object to this witness. She was not present at the time of the incident. Her testimony is irrelevant, irrational, and inconsequential.
HOYT Your Honor, the prosecution has gone to great lengths and considerable cost to find these character witnesses.It is imperative that we establish this is not merely an isolated incident. It's part of a pattern of anti-social behavior that's been going on for years.
VANDELAY Objection overruled. I'll hear the witness.
HOYT Now, Mrs. Choate, would you please tell the court what happen the evening of January 4th.
CHOATE Well, I was in Snitzer's Bakery when I got accosted by that man.
HOYT Let the record show that she is pointing at Mr. Seinfeld.
HOYT What did he want?
CHOATE My marble rye.
HOYT Your marble rye?
CHOATE I got the last one. He kept persisting, and I said no.
HOYT And then you left the bakery.
CHOATE That's right.
HOYT But it didn't end there, did it, Mrs. Choate?
CHOATE Oh no.
JERRY Gimme that rye.
CHOATE Stop it.
JERRY I want that rye lady.
CHOATE Help - someone help.
JERRY Shut up, you old bag!
HOYT No further questions.
HOYT I call Marla Penny to the stand.
BAILIFF Call Marla Penny.
JERRY The virgin!
HOYT And what was your connection to the defendants?
PENNY I dated Mr. Seinfeld for several weeks in the autumn of 1992.
HOYT Then on the evening of October 28, there was an abrupt end to that relationship. Tell us what happened.
PENNY It's rather difficult to talk about.
HOYT It's alright. Take your time.
PENNY Well, I became aware of a -
HOYT A what?
PENNY A, uh -
HOYT Yes?
PENNY A contest.
HOYT Contest?
PENNY Yes.
HOYT What was the nature of the contest?
PENNY Oh please, I can't.
HOYT It's okay.
PENNY The four of them made a wager to see if they could -
HOYT Yes?
PENNY To see who could go the longest without gratifying themselves.
PETERMAN For the love of God!
PENNY It was horrible, horrible!
HOYT Call Donald Sanger to the stand.
JERRY Who the hell is that?
MR._SANGER Come on Donald, you're doing fine.
GEORGE The Bubble Boy!
CHILES Bubble Boy?
JERRY That's right, the Bubble Boy.
CHILES What's a Bubble Boy?
JERRY He's a boy who lives in a bubble.
BUBBLE_BOY What the hell are all you looking at?
HOYT So Donald, would you please tell the court about the incident that occurred in your house, October 7th, 1992.
BUBBLE_BOY Well, Jerry Seinfeld was supposed to come to my house, but his friend Costanza showed up instead, so I challenged him to a game of Trivial Pursuit.
GEORGE Who invaded Spain in the Eighth Century?
BUBBLE_BOY That's a joke - the Moors.
GEORGE Oh no - I'm so sorry, it's the Moops. The correct answer is the Moops.
BUBBLE_BOY Moops? Let me see that. That's not Moops, you jerk. It's Moors. It's a misprint.
GEORGE Sorry, the card says Moops.
BUBBLE_BOY It doesn't matter. It's Moors - there's no Moops.
GEORGE It's Moops.
BUBBLE_BOY Moors!
GEORGE Moops!
GEORGE Help! Someone!
BUBBLE_BOY There's no Moops, you idiot.
SUSAN Stop it! Let go of him!
MRS._SANGER Donald, stop it. No. Donald, stop it.
GEORGE It was Moops.
BUBBLE_BOY Moors. the lady Kramer gave a defective wheelchair to in "The Handicapped Spot"
HOYT So Mr. Costanza parked in a handicapped spot, and as a result you got in an accident, and your wheelchair was destroyed?
LADY That's right.
HOYT And then Mr. Kramer gave you a used wheelchair?
LADY That's right. Dr. Wilcox, the doctor on duty when Susan died
HOYT So you were the doctor on duty the night Susan Ross died?
WILCOX Yes, that's right. It was May 16, 1996. I'll never forget it.
HOYT So you broke the news to Mr. Costanza? Could you tell the court, please, what his reaction was?
WILCOX I would describe it as restrained jubilation.
MR._ROSS Murderer!
MRS._ROSS He killed our daughter! He knew those envelopes were toxic!
VANDELAY Order in this court!
HOYT Call Sidra Holland to the stand.
CHILES Whew! Look at this one, she fine. You dated her?
HOYT So you met Jerry Seinfeld in a health club sometime in 1993?
SIDRA Yes.
HOYT And you also met Miss Benes in that same health club?
SIDRA Yes, that's true.
HOYT Would you describe the circumstances of that meeting.
SIDRA We were in the sauna, making chit-chat.
SIDRA You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcie.
ELAINE Oh, hi, I'm Elaine.
HOYT So, she pretended to trip, and she fell into your breasts?
SIDRA Yes.
HOYT Why would she do something like that?
SIDRA Because he sent her in there to find out if they were real. Joe Bookman, library cop
HOYT State your name.
BOOKMAN Bookman, Joe Bookman.
HOYT And what's your occupation?
BOOKMAN I'm a library cop.
HOYT What does a library cop do?
BOOKMAN We chase down library delinquents.
HOYT Anyone in this room ever delinquent?
BOOKMAN Yeah, he was. Right over there - Seinfeld.
HOYT How long was his book overdue?
BOOKMAN 25 years. We don't call them delinquent after that long.
HOYT What do you call them?
BOOKMAN Criminals. George's old girlfriend
HOYT So you and Mr. Costanza were dating.
WOMAN Yes.
HOYT And then what happened?
WOMAN Well, I invited him to attend my son's birthday party and -
GEORGE Fire! Get out of the way! parking lot security guard
GUARD At the time, I was employed as a security guard in the parking lot at the Garden Valley Shopping Mall.
JERRY Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
GUARD I don't know.
JERRY Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why.
HOYT Uromycitisis! I wonder if they're having any trouble controlling themselves during this trial? Perhaps these two hooligans would like to have a pee party right here in the courtroom!
CHILES Objection, Your Honor! This is completely inappropriate! My clients' medical condition is not on trial here! I refer you to the Disability Act of 1990.
VANDELAY Sit down, Mr. Chiles. Police Detective
HOYT Alright, Detective, then what happened?
DETECTIVE We got a tip that a lot of prostitutes had been turning tricks in the parking lot.

POLICE Police officers - freeze right there!
HOYT So Cosmo Kramer was, in fact, a pimp. the low-talker
HOYT So you asked Mr. Seinfeld if he would wear your puffy shirt on the Today Show?
HOYT Excuse me?
CHILES Uh, excuse me, Your Honor, but what is the point of this testimony? This woman's a low-talker. I can't hear a word she's saying. So either get some other kind of microphone up there, or let's move on. George Steinbrenner
HOYT Call George Steinbrenner to the stand.
BAILIFF Call George Steinbrenner.
HOYT So George Costanza came to work for you in May of 1994?
STEINBRENNER Yes, that's right, he was good kid - a lovely boy. Shared his calzone with me - that was a heck of a sandwich, wasn't it, Georgie?
GEORGE Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir.
STEINBRENNER He had one little problem though.
HOYT What was that?
STEINBRENNER He was a communist. Thick as they come. Like a big juicy steak.
FRANK How could you give twelve million dollars to Hideki Irabu?!
VANDELAY Order! Man from "The Little Jerry"

GEORGE Medium turkey chili.
JERRY Medium crab bisque.
GEORGE I didn't get any bread.
JERRY Just forget it. Let it go.
GEORGE Um, excuse me, I think you forgot my bread.
SOUP_NAZI You want bread?
GEORGE Yes, please.
SOUP_NAZI Three dollars!
GEORGE What?
SOUP_NAZI No soup for you!
SOUP_NAZI But the idiot clowns did not know how to order. I banned that one - the woman - for a year. Then one day, she came back.
ELAINE Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms. Half a cup of olive oil. Three pounds celery.
SOUP_NAZI That's my recipe for wild mushroom.
ELAINE You're through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
SOUP_NAZI She published my recipes. I had to close the store, move to Argentina. She ruined my business!
ELAINE Soup's not all that good anyway.
SOUP_NAZI What did you say?!
HOYT The state calls Mr. Babu Bhatt to the stand.
JERRY How did they find Babu?
ELAINE I thought he was deported.
HOYT You came a long way to be here today, haven't you?
BABU Yes, all the way from Pakistan.
HOYT And what's your connection to the defendant?
BABU I owned a restaurant. Seinfeld told me to change the menu to Pakistani. But nobody came! There were no people.
HOYT And then what happened?
BABU Then, he got me an apartment in his building. But they mixed up the mail. And I never got my immigration renewal papers. So they deported me. It's all his fault. Him. And the woman. But they did not care. They're totally indifferent. All they do is mock me, just like they did the fat fellow. All the time. Mocking, mocking, mocking, mocking, mocking. All the time! Now it is Babu's turn to mock. Finally I will have some justice. Send them away! Send them all away! Lock them up forever! They are not human. Very bad! Very, very, very bad!
RIVERA Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera and welcome to this special edition of Rivera Live. Well, arguments in the Good Samaritan trial ended today. The jury has been in deliberation for four and a half hours now. Let's go live to Jane Wells who is in Latham, Massachusetts, covering this trial for us. Jane -
WELLS Geraldo, just a few minutes ago, the jury asked to see the video tape.
RIVERA That's the one where they are overheard making sarcastic remarks during the robbery.
WELLS Yes, it's a very incriminating piece of evidence. But I must tell you, Geraldo, this courtroom and everyone who has attended this trial is still reeling from the endless parade of witness who have come forth so enthusiastically to testify against these four seemingly ordinary people. One even had the feeling that if Judge Vandelay didn't finally put a stop to it, it could've gone on for months.
RIVERA Jane, whose testimony do you think resonated most strongly with this jury?
WELLS That is so hard to say. Certainly there's the doctor with the poison invitations. The Bubble Boy was an extremely sympathetic and tragic figure. And that bizarre contest certainly didn't sit well with this small town jury.There's the woman they sold the defective wheelchair to, the deported Pakistani restaurateur. Geraldo, it just went on, and on, and on, into the night.
RIVERA And so we wait.
JERRY Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?
ELAINE I think so.
JERRY It's not that bright orange one is it?
ELAINE I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange.
KRAMER Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about when he asked that cop if a black man had ever been to his house. Did you see the look on his face?
ESTELLE Sorry to bother you, Judge.
VANDELAY How did you get in here?
ESTELLE Please, if he's found guilty, please be kind to him. He's a good boy.
VANDELAY This is highly irregular.
ESTELLE Well, maybe there's something I can do for you.
VANDELAY What do you mean?
ESTELLE You know
SIDRA Oh, Jackie, you're so articulate.
JACKIE We have plenty of time, too. This jury could be out for days.
JACKIE Hello? Damn. They're ready.
JERRY Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was going down?
ELAINE I've always loved ... United Airlines.
KRAMER I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me.
JERRY Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.
BAILIFF All rise.
VANDELAY Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
FOREMAN We have, Your Honor.
VANDELAY Will the defendants please rise. And how do you find, with respect to the charge of criminal indifference?
FOREMAN We find the defendants - guilty.
VANDELAY Order! Order in this court, I will clear this room! I do not know how, or under what circumstances the four of you found each other, but your callous indifference and utter disregard for everything that is good and decent has rocked the very foundation upon which our society is built. I can think of nothing more fitting than for the four of youto spend a year removed from society so that you can contemplate the manner in which you have conducted yourselves. I know I will. This court is adjourned.
GEORGE You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane.
ELAINE Puddy, don't wait for me.
PUDDY Alright.
FRANK We gotta get out of here. We want to beat the traffic.
SIDRA Come on, Jackie. Let's go.
JERRY What?
CHILES Oh, and by the way, they're real, and they're spectacular.
JERRY Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then we'll be back
KRAMER Could be fun. Don't have to worry about your meals, or what you're going to do Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe "Bye Bye Birdie" or "My Fair Lady". Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle.
ELAINE Why don't you just blow it out your...
ELAINE If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?
JERRY Sure.
ELAINE Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls.
JERRY I think that would be a very nice gesture.
KRAMER I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief.
JERRY See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.
GEORGE Really?
JERRY Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it, it's too high, it's in no-man's land.
GEORGE Haven't we had this conversation before?
JERRY You think?
GEORGE I think we have.
JERRY Yeah, maybe we have.
JERRY So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard. But of course she didn't have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy sticking a shiv in my thigh. And what's with the lockdown? Why do we have to be locked in our cells? Are we that bad that we have to be sent to prison, in prison? You would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. So, anyone from Cellblock D?
PRISONER_1 I am.
JERRY I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir?
PRISONER_2 Murder one.
JERRY Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding sir - lighten up. How about you, what are you in for?
PRISONER_3 Grand theft auto.
JERRY Grand theft auto - don't steal any of my jokes.
PRISONER_3 You suck - I'm gonna cut you.
JERRY Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of your hand.
GUARD Alright, Seinfeld, that's it. Let's go. Come on.
JERRY Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria.
JERRY So, I'm on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. They both of course choose to pay by the use of the
AUDIENCE Cheque
JERRY Cheque. Now, the fact is, if it's a woman in front of you that's writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, y'know, 'cuz they write out so many cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they don't know where that is, but the cheque book they got that. They never fumble for book from an imaginary holster ``Who do I make it out to?... There's my ID...''. There's something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine. I don't know exactly what it is... I think to a man, a cheque is like a note from your mother that says ``I don't have any money, but if you'll contact these people, I'm sure they'll stick up for me... If you just trust me this one time I don't have any money but I have these... I wrote on these; is this of any value at all?''
JERRY What's that one?
ELAINE "Coccoon II: The Return". I guess they didn't like it up there...
JERRY Maybe they came back for Chinese food. Y'know Maureen Stapleton, if she gets a craving, she's probably screamin' at those aliens, "I gotta have a Lo mein!"
ELAINE Okay, what're we doing here? I have seen everything.
JERRY Oh yeah? I don't believe you've seen... this.
ELAINE Oh, lovely...
JERRY Yeah...
ELAINE What do you think their parents think?
JERRY "So, uh, what's your son doing now, Dr. Stevens?" "Oh, he's a public fornicator. Yes, he's a fine boy..."
ELAINE Y'know what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamela's birthday.
JERRY Pamela? Do I know her?
ELAINE Yeah, you met her when we were going out.
JERRY Oh yeah, right...
ELAINE You have no idea who I'm talking about, do you?
JERRY No.
ELAINE Blonde hair remember? Glasses? Have you totally blocked out the entire time we were a couple?
JERRY Riverside Drive.
ELAINE Right! In fact... No, never mind...
JERRY Well, what is it?
ELAINE Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some bar for her birthday, but... you don't want to go to... that... no.
JERRY Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little deal here.
ELAINE What little deal?
JERRY I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding I have on Saturday.
ELAINE A wedding!? Have you lost it, man?
JERRY Y'know, my parents are coming in for this...
ELAINE They're coming in?
JERRY Yeah, tomorrow.
ELAINE Hey, did your father ever get that hair weave?
JERRY No, no... Still doin' the big sweep across.
ELAINE Why does he do that?
JERRY Doesn't think anyone can tell?
JERRY So c'mon, do we have a deal?
ELAINE A wedding?
JERRY There's a lot of people to mock...
ELAINE Alright, what the Hell.
JERRY Great!
WOMAN When you're dead, you're dead. That's it. You're not goin' anywhere...
ELAINE C'mon lets go, c'mon...
JERRY Was I supposed to bring something?
ELAINE You could have.
JERRY I met her one time...
ELAINE It is not necessary.
JERRY What did you say then?
ELAINE Sssshhhhhh!!!
PAMELA Hi
ELAINE Hi Pamela, you remember Jerry.
PAMELA Yes, we met.
JERRY Hi, happy birthday.
PAMELA Ahh, everybody, this is Elaine and Jerry.
GUESTS Hi
JERRY I didn't bring anything.
PAMELA Ahh, I put you two right here.
JERRY Oh, Okay I'm sorry, I didn't know what to bring, nobody told me.
VANESSA How big a tip do you think it'd take to get him to stop?
JERRY I'm in for five...
VANESSA I'll supply the hat.
JERRY Uh-oh... What do we have here...
VANESSA Why don't you relax and take your jacket off?
JERRY Oh, I can't-- I have a tendency to get chilly.
VANESSA How masculine...
JERRY Plus I'm wearing short sleeves, I don't want to expose my tattoos. She's unbelievable!
ROGER Hey, this guy says he knows Bricker...
VANESSA Oh, you know Bricker! From where?
JERRY What's going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, she's too good to be alone... What's the difference, I can't maneuver anyway with Elaine next to me...
VANESSA How do you know Pamela?
JERRY Friend of a friend. And you?
VANESSA We went to law school together.
ELAINE Oh, Jerry!
JERRY Oh no, not now...
ELAINE I had this dream last night and you were in it.
JERRY Oh really... Oh God, I gotta get out of this...
ELAINE You were you, but, you weren't you...
JERRY No kidding... Why is this happening? Please, make her stop!
ELAINE I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were standing there, you were looking out the window--
JERRY This is brutal...
ELAINE You turned around and you had these wooden teeth...
JERRY How do you like that... Can I turn now? Is this over? No, I can't, I can't... I'm stuck...
ELAINE Jerry? Are you listening to me?
JERRY Yes, I heard you.
PAMELA Elaine, what's the name of that jewelry store you took me to that time?
JERRY Thank you, Pamela!
JERRY So, you're a lawyer...
VANESSA Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.
JERRY Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft... Of course, they handled my tattoo removal lawsuit!
VANESSA Oh, that was you!
JERRY Imagine, spelling "Mom" with two O's...
VANESSA Very funny! What do you do?
JERRY Comedian.
VANESSA Really... That explains it...
JERRY Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.
ROGER Are you ready?
VANESSA We gotta run. Happy birthday!
JERRY I can't believe it-- I got nothing! I don't even know her name!
JERRY Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppen... Sagman... Sag...
JERRY That wasn't so bad, really...
ELAINE Y'know, uh, you could use a little work on your manners.
JERRY Why? What did I do?
ELAINE Well, I just don't appreciate these little "courtesy responses", like I'm selling you aluminum siding.
JERRY I was listening!
ELAINE No! You couldn't wait to get back to your little... "conversation".
JERRY No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had.
ELAINE Uh-huh...
JERRY Where you had, uh, wooden teeth.
ELAINE No! No! You had wooden teeth! You had wooden teeth! I didn't have wooden teeth, you did!
JERRY Alright, so I had wooden teeth, so what?
ELAINE So nothing... Nothing...
JERRY Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic relationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after himself. He said ``Yeah, I got this new thing-- "platonic". My idea, my name, callin' it after myself... What I do is, I go out with the girls, I talk with them-- don't do anything... and go right home. What'dya think? I think it's going to be big!'' I bet you there were other guys in history that tried to get relationships named after them, but it didn't work. Y'know, I bet Rico. Would you like to go to bed immediately? Hey, it's a "Riconic" relationship...''
JERRY Hey!
MORTY Ah, there he is!
JERRY This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your bed!
HELEN Y'know, Jerry, we don't have to do this...
JERRY What are you talkin' about? It's fine, I love having you here...
HELEN Tomorrow we'll go to a hotel.
JERRY Ma, will you stop?
HELEN No, why should we take over your apartment?
JERRY I don't care-- I'm sleeping next door.
HELEN Your friend Kramer doesn't mind?
JERRY No, he's making a bouillabaisse.
JERRY So Dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big law offices?
MORTY Depends on the firm.
JERRY Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they would know who it was?
MORTY What's the matter? You need a lawyer?
JERRY No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I don't know her name.
MORTY So why don't you ask someone who was at the party?
JERRY Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I can't ask her.
HELEN Why not?
JERRY Because it's complicated-- there's some tension there.
HELEN He used to go with her...
HELEN Which one is she?
MORTY From Maryland. The one who brought you the chocolate covered cherries you didn't like.
MORTY Oh yeah, very alert. Warm person.
JERRY Oh yeah, she's great.
HELEN So, how come nothing materialized there?
JERRY Well, it's a tough thing to talk about... I dunno...
HELEN I know what it was...
JERRY You don't know what it was...
HELEN So, what was it?
JERRY Well, we fight a lot for some reason... H + M Oh, well...
JERRY And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry...
HELEN Well, I think she's a very attractive girl.
JERRY Oh, she is, she absolutely is.
HELEN I can see if there was a weight problem...
JERRY No, it's not that. It wasn't all one-sided.
HELEN You know, you can't be so particular. Nobody's perfect.
JERRY I know, I know...
MORTY Y'know Jerry, it's a good thing I wasn't so particular.
HELEN Idiot... So who're you looking for, Sophia Loren?
JERRY That's got nothin' to do with it.
MORTY How about Loni Anderson?
HELEN Where do you get Loni Anderson?
MORTY Why, what's wrong with Loni Anderson?
HELEN I like Elaine more than Loni Anderson...
JERRY What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasn't "the one".
HELEN And this other one's "the one"?
JERRY I dunno, maybe...
MORTY So ask Elaine there for the number.
JERRY I can't-- she'll get upset. I never talk about other women with her, especially this one tonight.
HELEN How could you still see her if your not interested?
JERRY We're friends.
MORTY Doesn't sound like you're friends to me. If you were friends you'd ask her for the number. Do you know where this other one works?
JERRY Oh yeah...
MORTY Well, go up to the office.
HELEN Up to her office?
MORTY Go to the building. She goes out to lunch, doesn't she?
JERRY I guess...
MORTY So, you stand in the lobby, by the elevator, and wait for her to come down for lunch.
JERRY You mean "stakeout" the lobby?
HELEN Morty, that's ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number!
MORTY He doesn't want to ask Elaine for the number.
HELEN So you've got him standing by the elevator like a dope! What happens when he sees her?
MORTY He pretends he bumped into her!
JERRY Y'know what? This is not that bad an idea...
GEORGE What does she look like?
JERRY I dunno. Hard to say.
GEORGE What actress does she remind you of?
JERRY Loni Anderson.
GEORGE Loni Anderson?!
JERRY What, there's something wrong with Loni Anderson?
JERRY Hey listen, thanks again for running over here. I appreciate it.
GEORGE Yeah, sure. I was showing a condo on 48th st. Besides, you think I wanna miss this?
JERRY I'm a little nervous.
GEORGE Yeah, me too...
JERRY If I see her, what do I say that I'm doing here in the building?
GEORGE You came to see me; I work in the building.
JERRY What do you do?
GEORGE I'm an architect.
JERRY You're an architect?
GEORGE I'm not?
JERRY I don't see architecture comin from you...
GEORGE I suppose you could be an architect...
JERRY I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin' else...
GEORGE Alright, she's not even gonna ask, if we see her, which is remote.
JERRY Well what'dya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?!
GEORGE We're having lunch with a friend-- he works in the building.
JERRY What is his name?
GEORGE Bert... Har... bin... son. Bert Har-bin-son.
JERRY Bert Harbinson? It sounds made up.
GEORGE No good? Alright, how about Art... Corr.....
JERRY Art Corr...
GEORGE ...velay...
JERRY Corvelay?
GEORGE Yeah, right.
JERRY Well, what does he do?
GEORGE He's an importer.
JERRY Just imports, no exports?
GEORGE He's an importer/exporter, okay?
GEORGE Say, did Elaine ever call you back?
JERRY No, I guess she's still mad.
GEORGE I don't understand, you never talk to her about other women?
JERRY Never.
JERRY Wait a second... That's her... on the right.
GEORGE I forgot who I am! Who am I?!
JERRY You're you. We're having lunch with Art Corvelay.
GEORGE Vandelay!
JERRY Corvelay!
GEORGE Let me be the architect, I can do it!
JERRY Hey, hey... Pamela's birthday party, didn't I see you there... Jerry.
VANESSA Sure! Hi!
JERRY This is George. I'm sorry...
VANESSA Vanessa.
GEORGE Nice to meet you.
JERRY Ah, Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.
VANESSA That's right! What're you doing here?
JERRY Oh, were meeting a friend of ours for lunch. He works here in the building.
GEORGE Yeah, Art Vandelay.
VANESSA Really? Which company?
JERRY I don't know. He's an importer.
VANESSA Importer?
GEORGE ...And exporter.
JERRY He's an importer/exporter.
GEORGE I'm, uh, I'm an architect.
VANESSA Really. What do you design?
GEORGE Uh, railroads, uh...
VANESSA I thought engineers do that.
GEORGE They can...
JERRY Y'know I'm sorry you had to leave so early the other night.
VANESSA Oh, me too. My cousin had to go back to Boston.
JERRY Oh, that guy was your cousin!
VANESSA Yeah, and that woman was your--
JERRY Friend!
GEORGE I'll just, uh, get a paper...
JERRY So, um, do you date immature men?
VANESSA Almost exclusively...
HELEN Bum bum bum bum... I have no letters... Bum bum bum bum...
JERRY Ma, will you go already?
HELEN Bum bum bum bum...
JERRY What are you doing?!
HELEN Wait, I just want to see something...
JERRY You can't look in there, we're playing!
MORTY Evening, Mr. Kramer!
KRAMER Hey Morty! Salad dressing?
JERRY Look.
HELEN "Quo"? Is that a word?
JERRY Maybe!
HELEN Will you challenge it?
JERRY Ma, you can't look up words in the dictionary! Dad, she's cheating!
KRAMER "Quo"? That's not a word.
HELEN You're such a stickler...
JERRY Well put something down, you're taking twenty minutes on this. So is Uncle Mac, and Artie, they're all coming over here before the wedding?
HELEN They'll be here at two o'clock... Oh, Elaine called. She said
SHE'D_BE_HERE_AT_2 30. Oh, and she says ``Hope your meeting went well with Art... "Vandelay"?''
JERRY She said what?
HELEN Just what I said, here.
JERRY She knows! Oh, I am such a jackass...
HELEN She knows what?
JERRY She knows the whole stupid thing... Vanessa and the elevator...
HELEN No, no, no, that won't do. He may have a "Z"...
MORTY So, how did she find out?
JERRY Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably told Elaine.
MORTY So, what are you? Afraid of her?
JERRY Yes. Yes I am!
JERRY What else did she say on the phone?
HELEN Whatever I wrote down.
JERRY Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound?
HELEN Who am I, Rich Little?
MORTY Well, she can't be too mad-- she's still coming to the wedding.
JERRY Yeah, but now I'm nervous.
HELEN Oh, stop it.
JERRY "Quone"?
HELEN ...30...31...
JERRY "Quone"? No, I'm afraid that I'm going to have to challenge that.
HELEN ...32...
KRAMER No, you don't have to challenge that. That's a word. That's a definite word.
JERRY I am challenging...
KRAMER Quone: to quone something.
JERRY Uh-huh...
HELEN I'm not playing with you anymore...
MORTY Quone's not a word...
JERRY No good. Sorry. There it is. Get it off...
HELEN Why did you make me put that down?
KRAMER Nah, we need a medical dictionary! If a patient gets difficult, you quone him...
CAROL You want some funny material, you oughta come down to where I work, now that's a sitcom!
JERRY You must have quite a time down there.
CAROL We got plenty of time...
JERRY Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just waiting for someone...
MAC Watch what you say to this guy-- he'll put it in his next act!
JERRY Yeah, yeah...
MAC Jerry, did I tell you that I'm writing a book? An autobiography.
JERRY Yeah, Uncle Mac, you mentioned it...
MAC It's based on all my experiences!
JERRY That's perfect. Could you excuse me one second. I'm sorry.
JERRY How do you do, Jerry Seinfeld.
ELAINE Oh, how do you do. Elaine Benes.
JERRY Um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until we get in the car?
ELAINE Oh no, let's do it now.
JERRY Alright, the whole elevator business, let me just explain--
ELAINE Okay...
ARTIE Jerry, were you goin' with us?
JERRY No, I'm gonna take my car.
ARTIE That's why I brought the wagon. Why the Hell did I bring the wagon?
JERRY Anyway, you know why I didn't ask you, I mean I felt so uncomfortable, and you were so annoyed in the cab.
ELAINE Well, Jerry, I never saw you flirt with anyone before. It was quite the spectacle.
CAROL Jerry, we'll see you there. Bye, Elaine.
ELAINE Oh, bye. Good to see you.
ARTIE Oh, we didn't meet.
JERRY Oh, I'm sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin Artie Levine.
ARTIE Levine.
JERRY Yeah, "Levine". And I'm Jerry Cougar Mellencamp... Anyway, I admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean, obviously we have a little problem here.
ELAINE Yeah, obviously.
JERRY I mean, if we're gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about other people...
ELAINE Couldn't agree more.
JERRY Good.
ELAINE Good.
JERRY Good.
ELAINE Great!
JERRY Great? Where do you get "great"?
ELAINE It's great to... talk about... other people...
JERRY ...Guys.
ELAINE Yeah.
JERRY Uh-huh... Yeah... So, anybody specific?
ELAINE No. A general guy.
JERRY Oh really... Elaine Marie Benes...
ELAINE What? No, it's not a big deal.
JERRY No, that's great! That's terrific!
ELAINE No, we just met...
JERRY Doesn't matter. What's the young man's name? I would like to meet him.
ELAINE I don't think so...
JERRY Well, what does he do? Is he an artisan, a craftsman, a labourer of some sort?
ELAINE Wall street.
JERRY Ahh, high finance: bulls... bears... people from Conneticut.
ELAINE And he happens to be pretty good lookin'
JERRY Alright, sir.
ELAINE And... he's hilarious.
JERRY Now that's not fair! So where did you meet this guy?
ELAINE I "staked" out his health club.
JERRY When you're on a stakeout, do you find it's better to stand up against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant?...
JERRY Y'know I think that even if you've had a relationship with someone, or let's say, especially if you've had a relationship with someone and you try to become friends afterwards, it's very difficult. Isn't this? It's hard. Because, you know each other so well, you know all of each others tricks. It's like two magicians, trying to entertain each other. The one goes, "Look, a rabbit." The other goes, "So? ... I believe this is your card." "Look, why don't we just saw each other in half and call it a night? Okay?"
GEORGE Man, I'm starving.
ELAINE How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game?
GEORGE Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food.
JERRY Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band.
KRAMER You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away.
JERRY I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of the game.
ELAINE Oh, come on, Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting shellacked.
GEORGE Those nachos are killing me.
ELAINE I thought you were hungry.
GEORGE It's complicated.
KRAMER Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit.
JERRY Keep your shirt on. I got it.
ELAINE Watch out for that maroon Golf.
KRAMER Oh, boy.
JERRY Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out.
KRAMER I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait-- now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now! Jerry! Go--ahh...
JERRY Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He accelerated.
KRAMER You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass.
ELAINE Oh, no, I couldn't do that.
KRAMER Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger.
ELAINE Oh, all right.
KRAMER Yeah.
GEORGE So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg.
ELAINE Oh, yeah. What's that called?
GEORGE Blimp: The Hindenburg Story.
JERRY How was it?
GEORGE I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?
JERRY Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg flights that made it.
GEORGE Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles over the airfield, I yelled out, "That's gotta hurt!"
JERRY Heh.
GEORGE The place went nuts.
JERRY Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster.
GEORGE Yeah.
KRAMER Why are we slowing down?
JERRY What is that music?
GEORGE What's with all these flags?
JERRY Oh, no.
ELAINE_AND_JERRY It's the Puerto Rican Day parade!
ELAINE Ohh! Oh, the city shuts down Fifth avenue. They never let anyone through. We're never getting home.
KRAMER All right. I'm gonna check it out. Aiee. mucho trafico.
KRAMER Yeah...uhh...well, the streets are all blocked. I think every Puerto Rican in the world is out here.
PUERTO_RICAN_MAN Well, it is our day.
KRAMER Whoo. Wrong car. Sorry.
RADIO And the Mets score two in the eighth inning.
JERRY See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs.
GEORGE I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have calmed down the nachos.
ELAINE I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down.
JERRY I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious.
KRAMER All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can get out over there.
JERRY But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how am I gonna get all the way over there?
GEORGE Just inch over. You worm your way.
ELAINE Just do it, Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up.
KRAMER You know, you should make yourself throw up.
ELAINE Huh?
KRAMER You know you're going to.
JERRY All right, I'm worming.
KRAMER Hey, Jerry. You know who the grand marshal is of this thing? None other than Miss Chita Rivera.
JERRY They're not letting me in.
GEORGE My hand is out.
JERRY Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have to see a human face.
ELAINE You sure you want his face?
KRAMER No, no, no. It was Mar�a Conchita Alonso.
GEORGE This guy's giving me the stare-ahead.
JERRY The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time.
GEORGE Look at me! I am man! I am you!
GEORGE All right, he's letting you in. Thank you! Creep.
KRAMER Oh! I know who it is. Stacy Keach.
JERRY One more lane to go.
GEORGE All right! We're here!
LAMAR Oh, look who's here. My old buddy, black Saab.
JERRY Maroon Golf.
LAMAR Where you goin', black Saab? You seem to be a tad askew.
JERRY Could you move your car back a little?
LAMAR Oh. Sorry. I seem to have cut you off.
ELAINE All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am going somewhere else.
JERRY You can't do that. You can't just leave the group.
ELAINE I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya con dios.
KRAMER Con dios? Well, that's rude.
JERRY Can you believe her?
GEORGE Yeah. I'll see you later.
JERRY Where are you going?
GEORGE The movies. Blimp is playing right there.
JERRY You're going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid line?
GEORGE It's a performance, Jerry. Like what you do.
JERRY That's not what I do.
GEORGE Isn't it?
JERRY Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is.
KRAMER You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that big in a while.
ELAINE Look at that guy's dog. I hate it when their ears get flipped inside out like that. Why doesn't he fix it?
ELAINE Hey! Fold your dog's ear back!
ELAINE Ooh! This isn't moving! I could walk faster than this.
CAB_DRIVER No, you can't.
ELAINE Yes, I can. Here. I'm outta here.
ELAINE Oh, now it's moving. Oh, yeah. I knew it. Hey! Hey!
CAB_DRIVER Where to?
ELAINE That's cute. That's really cute. Oh! Come on! All right. Bye again.
ELAINE Hey. Taxi! Taxi!
GEORGE Ladies. I, uh, I haven't seen this before.
LADY_1 What is that dot?
LADY_2 Oh, I think someone has one of those funny laser pointers.
LASER_GUY Gimme a box of those and one of those.
GEORGE Excuse me, are you the guy with that funny laser?
LASER_GUY The laser's not funny. I'm funny.
GEORGE Yeah. The thing is, I, uh...I had this little zinger of my own I wanted to try.
LASER_GUY Uh-huh.
GEORGE It's right in the explosion scene. So if you could just...leave me a little window. You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed with a laser. All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so...
JERRY I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we could get out of here.
LAMAR This traffic's a killer, ain't it?
KRAMER You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number off the engine block, and we walk away.
JERRY Walk away?
KRAMER You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, and then you get another one free.
JERRY Isn't there a deductible?
KRAMER All right, what is your deductible?
JERRY I don't know.
KRAMER Yes, because they've already deducted it.
JERRY From what?
KRAMER The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car.
JERRY We're not leaving the car!
KRAMER All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf.
JERRY Absolutely not. He sped up.
RADIO Swung on, line hard toward left center field. That's in the gap, that's a base hit.
JERRY I'm ready to talk.
LADY_1 Hey! There's that laser guy again.
LADY_2 He's funny. I never meet anyone funny.
LADY_1 I know. A sense of humor is so much more important to me than looks or hair.
LADY_2 Mmm, yeah.
GEORGE That's gotta hurt!
GEORGE It's...gotta hurt! Hurt! Because...Aaarrrrrgh!
GEORGE Damn you, laser guy! You had to grab it all with your lowbrow laser shtick! You're just a prop comic! Where's the craft?!
LADY_1 Look! It's on the bald guy.
LADY_2 I am so glad we came to this showing.
KRAMER Ok, here's the deal. He wants you to acknowledge that you cut him off with an "I am sorry" wave.
JERRY What's that?
KRAMER You raise the hand, lower the head-- "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The buttons are really big on the car. I don't understand it. I haven't read the manual. Ooh!" You get my drift.
JERRY Ok!
LAMAR Hallelujah. Praise the lord. But I'll take it.
KRAMER Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can get out now.
GEORGE All right. At last, we're finally gettin' out of here.
JERRY What's that on your forehead?
GEORGE It's probably chocolate.
JERRY Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?
KRAMER Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd. It's a George laserium!
GEORGE All right, stop it! Stay away from my breasts! Chest!
JERRY See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an "I'm not sorry" wave.
LAMAR What was that?
JERRY I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! So long, jackass!
JERRY Elaine?!
ELAINE Jerry?!
LAMAR Jackass? So I'm a jackass now?
JERRY So if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the same time, we can do this. All right, on the count of three. Can everyone hear me? Hey, amigo, are you paying attention?
PUERTO_RICAN_MAN Buenos dias, my friend.
JERRY Not you! The guy in the Amigo.
ELAINE Uh, well, uh, here--here is good.
TAXI_DRIVER Oh, yeah, sure, and now I'm gonna be stuck here. But you knew the way to go! You went to college!
ELAINE Hey, I went to Tufts! That was my safety school! So don't talk to me about hardship.
ELAINE Boy, eh, can you believe this mess?
JERRY Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! We were almost out!
LAMAR So that was your girlfriend that blocked you in. That's real good.
ELAINE I'm not his girlfriend. Well, actually, we used to date, but not anymore.
JERRY Elaine, he doesn't need-
LAMAR Used to date? So I guess you found out he's a jackass.
JERRY 'Cause that's what's gonna happen.
KRAMER Wow. He's givin' you a mustache. Where is this guy?
GEORGE Don't look around. Don't look around. That's what he wants.
ELAINE All right. Well, I'll see ya. Hey, George, I think there's a sniper lookin' to pop ya.
GEORGE This thing can't hurt me, can it? I mean, it is a laser. What if it hits my eye?
JERRY I don't know.
GEORGE I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous.
KRAMER You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the pupil, 'Cause then the whole ball will go up like the Death Star. Tchoo! I gotta go find a bathroom.
JERRY Hold it, George. Don't move. It's right between your eyes.
GEORGE Oh, my god.
JERRY Hey, there's the soda guy.
LAMAR Hey, jackass! Get me a diet Dr. Pepper!
JERRY All right!
OLDER_MAN Hey, hey, hey!
OLDER_WOMAN Wha--ow!
ELAINE Oh, this is nuts! I can't get across anywhere!
OLDER_MAN Well, none of us can! We're trapped!
OLDER_WOMAN Ow!
ELAINE Hey! Hey, everyone. This way. I think we can get out through here.
OLDER_MAN Oh, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
ELAINE Look! No one knows how long this parade is gonna last! They are a very festive people. All I know is that it's Sunday night, and I have got to unwind! Now who's with me?!
OLDER_WOMAN Father?
PRIEST None of us saw the nylon flap. That might mean something.
PREGNANT_WOMAN Oh, all right, all right!
ELAINE All right! Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
BUSINESS_MAN But it's dark!
ELAINE Get in there!
KRAMER Yes, uh, I'm interested in the apartment.
SALES_WOMAN Yes! Come in, come in.
KRAMER Ok.
SALES_WOMAN I'm Christine Nyhart.
KRAMER Oh. Delicious to meet you.
SALES_WOMAN Did the broker send you over?
KRAMER Uh, yes, most likely, yes. I'm, uh, H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy industrialist and philanthropist and, uh, a bicyclist. And, um, yes, I'm looking for a place where I can settle down with my, uh, peculiar habits, and, uh, the women that I frequent with. Mmm. Mombassa, hmm?
SALES_WOMAN The asking price is $1.5 million.
KRAMER Oh, I spend that much on after shave. Yes, I buy and sell men like myself every day. Now, I assume that there's a waterfall grotto?
SALES_WOMAN No.
KRAMER How about a bathroom?
SALES_WOMAN It has 4.
KRAMER Yes, and where would the absolute nearest one be?
SALES_WOMAN Just down the hall.
KRAMER Oh, thank you.
ELAINE Oh, don't worry. We'll get you home to your husband real soon.
PREGNANT_WOMAN I'm not married.
ELAINE Well, I, for one, really respect that.
PREGNANT_WOMAN Oh, thank you.
ELAINE Hey! Guess who's not married.
OLDER_MAN Is the boyfriend still in the picture?
ELAINE Come on, father, you can make it.
PRIEST No, I can't. I've got a bad hip. Go on without me.
ELAINE No! I won't!
PRIEST Leave me! you must.
ELAINE All right. Take it easy.
ELAINE All right, we can move faster without father o'gimpy.
PRIEST I heard that!
LAMAR You know, I don't think I've ever seen a man driving a Saab convertible. Still haven't.
JERRY Ho ho!
JERRY What seems to be the problem, officer?
GEORGE They're for protection, Jerry. Can you tell where I'm lookin'?
JERRY At me?
GEORGE No.
JERRY Oh. It's back.
GEORGE Bring it on, baby
JERRY What if it gets in the side?
GEORGE The side?
JERRY Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more intense, until finally-
GEORGE All right!
JERRY Oh. It's in your eye now.
KRAMER Hola, Jerry! I'm into this Puerto Rican day! The sights! The sounds! The hot, spicy flavor of it all! It's caliente, Jerry!
JERRY Kramer, the Mets have got men on base!
KRAMER Yeah, I know! I was watchin' the game.
JERRY You were watchin'? Where?
JERRY Oh, that was a strike! Did you see that?!
SALES_WOMAN Would you like to see the rest of the apartment, Mister, um--
JERRY Eh...Varnsen. Kel Varnsen. Actually, this room intrigues me. Why is it called the TV room?
SALES_WOMAN Well, it's--
JERRY Balk?! How was that a balk?! You have any snacks?
SALES_WOMAN Mr. Varnsen, if you like the apartment, I should tell you I've also had some interest from a wealthy industrialist.
JERRY Not Pennypacker!
SALES_WOMAN You know him?
JERRY I wish I didn't. Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding war. But this time, advantage Varnsen!
GEORGE Wait a second. I think I see where that laser guy is. No! Don't look! Don't look. Oh, yeah, that's him. Ok. I'm gonna sneak up on him. Now the hunted becomes the hunter.
ELAINE We should be able to get across right through here!
OLDER_WOMAN It's a dead end!
ELAINE Oh, no! I thought--
BUSINESS_MAN You thought?! We're gonna die in the dark! I knew it! I knew it! We're gonna die!
ELAINE Get a hold of yourself!
PREGNANT_WOMAN Oh, come on!
OLDER_WOMAN Oooh!
ELAINE Sorry. Somebody...help us!
MAN !Mira! !Mira! Stacy Keach!
ELAINE We're down here! Help!
MAN There's people down there! Hold on!
ELAINE Let us out. There's an unmarried pregnant woman down here.
PREGNANT_WOMAN Don't judge me!
ELAINE Help us up so we can cross the street?
POLICE_OFFICER Nah, nah, You can't cross here. There's a parade.
ELAINE But we've come so far. We just want to unwind.
POLICE_OFFICER Hey, what can I tell ya?
BUSINESS_MAN Wanna make out some more?
ELAINE Oh, god! Let us out!
GEORGE That wasn't a laser pen.
DELIVERY_MAN No. It's just a pen.
GEORGE Oh, that's funny
DELIVERY_MAN No. You have, like, a dot on your face. Whoever's doing that is very clever.
KRAMER Come on, man. You need to lighten up. You know, a feeling like this only happens once a year.
KRAMER Yeah, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
KRAMER See, now you're getting the spirit of it, huh?
KRAMER Ooh! !Dios mio!
MAN Hey! There's a guy burning the Puerto Rican flag!
BOB Who! Who is burning the flag?!
KRAMER Oh, no.
BOB Him?!
CEDRIC That's not very nice.
KRAMER It was an accident.
BOB Do you know what day this is? Because I know what day this is, they know what day this is, so I was wondering if you know what day this is!
CEDRIC Because it's Puerto Rican day.
BOB Maybe we should stomp you like you stomp the flag! What do you think of that?
KRAMER Now look, I just have one thing to say to you boys. Mama! Kramer runs off screaming. The others give chase.
SALES_WOMAN Right this way, Mr. Vandelay.
GEORGE Well, this is a lovely apartment. Lovely! My kids are gonna go crazy. I, uh, I wonder if I could see the bathrooms. Preferably one with some paint thinner and, uh, some rags?
SALES_WOMAN It's down the hall.
JERRY Oh, hello...
GEORGE Art.
JERRY Mr. Vandelay, of course.
SALES_WOMAN You two know each other?
SALES_WOMAN Mr. Pennypacker!
KRAMER Uh, yes, uh, I--I wanted to, uh, stop by and make sure that my shark tank fits-- uh, hello.
SALES_WOMAN Mr. Pennypacker, this is Mr. Vandelay, And you know Mr. Varnsen
KRAMER Uh, Varnsen.
JERRY Pennypacker.
KRAMER Vandelay.
GEORGE Pennypacker. Varnsen.
JERRY Vandelay. Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here, and Mr. Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory?
KRAMER The factory?
JERRY The Saab factory?
KRAMER Jerry, that's in Sweden.
JERRY My car!
KRAMER Well, you know, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
GEORGE Jerry, the Mets lost.
JERRY I love a parade!
GEORGE How do you suppose they did that?
KRAMER Well...there's no logical explanation. All right. Well, shall we go home?
JERRY Well, what about my car?
KRAMER Well, Jerry, you can't deduct it now.
JERRY Hey, there's Elaine.
ELAINE Hey.
JERRY Well, you look, uh...relaxed.
ELAINE Well, it is Sunday night, and you know how I like to unwind.
LAMAR Hey, black Saab. Looks like that building cut you off! Ha ha ha! See ya around!
JERRY Well, at least he didn't-
LAMAR Jackass!
JERRY Somebody remember where we parked.
KRAMER This was a fun day. It's nice to get out.
LEVITAN Remind me to tell you what we did in Lake George. Get this...I got it all on video.
GEORGE That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm gone. Finished. Over. I will never work for you again. Look at you. You think you're an important man? Is that what you think? You are a laughingstock. You are a joke. These people are laughing at you. You're nothing! You have no brains, no ability, nothing! I quit!
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again last night at three o'clock in the morning to tell me he's going up onto the roof to kill himself.
JERRY Well, what'd you say?
KRAMER I said " Jump." Well, he's been threatening to do this for years. I said " Look, if you're gonna kill yourself do it already and stop bothering me." At least I'd respect the guy for accomplishing something.
JERRY What's his problem?
KRAMER No job. No women.
JERRY He called the right guy.
KRAMER What am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him to live for? Why should I lie to him?
JERRY All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry.
KRAMER Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?
JERRY Fluff and fold. The only way to live. I drop it off. I pick it up. It's a delight.
KRAMER How 'bout if I put a few things --
JERRY Wait a sec. I don't wanna do --
KRAMER Well, you're going over there.
JERRY I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your guys. You can't just lock 'em all in the same machine together. They'll start a riot.
KRAMER Have you ever met my guys?
JERRY No. I can't say as I have.
KRAMER Well!
JERRY All right. Put 'em on top.
KRAMER Ah!
JERRY Oh, beautiful. This stuff on top is my friends'. Could I get it done in a separate machine?
VIC I'll have to charge you for another machine.
JERRY Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines are not even touching each other. Because something could, you know, jump across.
GEORGE Guess what.
JERRY How did you know I was here?
GEORGE Kramer. Guess what.
JERRY I don't know.
GEORGE I quit my job.
JERRY Get outta here.
GEORGE I couldn't take it anymore.
VIC You can have this on Monday.
JERRY What happened? Levitan?
GEORGE I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, and then I get a memo - a memo - telling me to use the men's room in the hall. Well, we share it with Pace Electronics. It's disgusting!
JERRY You and your toilets.
GEORGE I snapped! It was the last straw.
JERRY So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something else in real estate?
GEORGE Nobody's hiring now. The market's terrible.
JERRY So what are you gonna do?
GEORGE I like sports. I could do something in sports.
JERRY Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In what capacity?
GEORGE You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something.
JERRY Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get.
GEORGE Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could be like, an announcer. Like a caller man. You know how I always make those interesting comments during the game.
JERRY Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments.
GEORGE What about that?
JERRY Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that are, you know, in broadcasting.
GEORGE Well, that's really not fair.
JERRY I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like?
GEORGE Movies. I like to watch movies.
JERRY Yeah. Yeah.
GEORGE Do they pay people to watch movies?
JERRY Projectionists.
GEORGE That's true.
JERRY But you gotta know how to work the projector.
GEORGE Right.
JERRY And it's probably a union thing.
GEORGE Those unions. Okay. Sports,...movies. What about a talk show host?
JERRY Talk show host. That's good.
GEORGE I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host.
JERRY Really?
GEORGE Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where do you start?
JERRY Well, that's where it gets tricky.
GEORGE You can't just walk into a building and say " I wanna be a talk show host."
JERRY I wouldn't think so.
GEORGE It's all politics.
JERRY All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else?
GEORGE This could have been a huge mistake.
JERRY Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through.
GEORGE What should I do?
JERRY Maybe you can just go back.
GEORGE Go back?
JERRY Yeah. Pretend like it never happened.
GEORGE You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it never happened?
JERRY Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you seriously.
GEORGE Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened.
JERRY Never happened.
GEORGE I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what?
JERRY So what? You're entitled.
GEORGE I'm emotional.
JERRY That's right. You're emotional.
GEORGE Never happened.
JERRY Never happened.
GEORGE How ya doin'?
GLENDA What are you doing here?
GEORGE What? I work here.
GLENDA I thought you quit.
GEORGE What quit? Who quit?
DAN Bill, how was your weekend?
BILL Oh, excellent weekend. What about your weekend?
DAN Fine weekend.
GEORGE Yeah. Good weekend.
DAN Went up to the Cape. Took the kids sailing. Lisa was a little scared at first, but that kids' gonna be a good sailor someday.
GEORGE Aw, she's gonna be a fine sailor.
LEVITAN Ava, what happened to you Friday afternoon?
AVA I got a little tied up.
LEVITAN I'll bet you did.
LEVITAN I wanna remind everyone that the tenth anniversary party for Rick Barr Properties is gonna be Wednesday afternoon at four o'clock in Lasky's Bar, Madison 48th. I want all of you to be there. This really means a lot to me. Is that Costanza over there? What are you doing here?
GEORGE What?
LEVITAN Am I crazy, or didn't you quit?
GEORGE When?
LEVITAN Friday.
GEORGE Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? You took that seriously?
LEVITAN You mean, laughingstock? All that stuff?
GEORGE Come on. Will you stop it.
LEVITAN No brains? No ability?
GEORGE Teasing.
LEVITAN Okay. I want you outta here.
GEORGE I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're serious aren't you? Oh, you see?
LEVITAN You can't win. You can't beat me. That's why I'm here and you're there. Because I'm a winner. I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser.
GEORGE " I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser." This is what he said to me.
JERRY Well, so that's that.
GEORGE No. That's not that.
JERRY That's not that?
GEORGE No.
JERRY Well, if that's not that, what is that?
GEORGE I've got some plans. I got plans.
JERRY What kind of plans?
GEORGE What's the difference?
JERRY You don't wanna tell me?
GEORGE I'm gonna slip him a mickey.
JERRY What? In his drink? Are you outta your mind? What? Are you Peter Lorre?
GEORGE You don't understand. He's got this big party coming up. He's been looking forward to this for months. This is gonna destroy the whole thing.
JERRY What if you destroy him?
GEORGE No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I researched it. He'll get a little woozy. He might keel over.
JERRY Well, wha - what does that do? Big deal.
GEORGE This is what they would do in the movies! It's a beautiful thing! It's like a movie! I'm gonna slip him a mickey!
JERRY You've really gone mental.
GEORGE Nah.
JERRY Where are you gonna get this mickey? I can't believe I'm saying "mickey"!
GEORGE I got a sauce.
JERRY You got a mickey sauce?
GEORGE And Elaine is gonna keep him busy.
JERRY Elaine? How did you rope her into this?
GEORGE I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife.
JERRY She knew that.
GEORGE But she didn't know he doesn't recycle.
JERRY What is the point of all this?
GEORGE Revenge.
JERRY Oh, the best revenge is living well.
GEORGE There's no chance of that.
JERRY Did you get your laundry?
KRAMER Yeah.
JERRY What's with you?
KRAMER He jumped.
JERRY What?
KRAMER Yeah. Newman jumped.
JERRY Did he call you last night?
KRAMER Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
JERRY What did you say?
KRAMER I said " Wave to me when you pass my window."
JERRY Whew. Did he wave?
KRAMER No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous saw him from across the street. He's lying out there faking. See, he's trying to get back at me.
JERRY Oh, my god!
KRAMER What's the matter?
JERRY Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For some reason I decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then I completely forgot about it...and then I took the laundry in on Friday! Oh, come on, let's go.
KRAMER Where? Where?
JERRY To the Laundromat.
VIC I never saw it.
KRAMER Okay. Come on. Give the guy his money. What -- what are you doing?
VIC Hey, you see that sign right there?
JERRY Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever you want?
VIC I'm not responsible.
JERRY So, anybody leaves anything here, you can just take it? You have a license to steal? You are like the James Bond of laundry?
VIC You ever hear of a bank?
JERRY Come on. Let's go.
KRAMER No. You can't let him get away with this.
ELAINE Which one is he?
GEORGE That's him over there. The one that looks like a blowfish.
ELAINE Oh, yeah. I see him.
GEORGE Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing this.
ELAINE Why pass up the opportunity to go to prison?
GEORGE This is by far the most exciting thing I've ever done.
ELAINE Yeah. It is kind of cool.
GEORGE First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone.
ELAINE I can't believe we're doing this. This is the kind of thing they do in the movies.
GEORGE That's exactly what I told Jerry!
ELAINE Really?
GEORGE Yes!
GEORGE God, I've never felt so alive!
JERRY Maybe we should call this off.
KRAMER Come on. What's the big deal? Just gonna put a little concrete in the washing machine.
JERRY And what's gonna happen?
KRAMER Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the end of the cycle it'll be a solid block!
JERRY If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile. You're like Lex Luthor.
KRAMER You keep him busy.
KRAMER Whoa!
GEORGE You go over there -
ELAINE Yeah.
GEORGE You start flirting with him and I'll come by and, while you're keeping him busy, I'll slip it in his drink.
ELAINE Wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth?
LEVITAN Come on! They're terrible. They got no infield.
ELAINE Oops! 'Scuse me.
LEVITAN Yeah.
GREENY I'm gonna get some food. You want some?
LEVITAN Nah.
ELAINE Hi.
LEVITAN Hi.
ELAINE 
LEVITAN God bless you.
ELAINE Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much. Really. I mean that. I am not one of those people who give insincere thank you's. No sir. No sir. When I thank someone I really thank them. So, thank... yoooou!
LEVITAN You're welcome.
ELAINE People don't say " God bless you " as much as they used to. Have you noticed that?
LEVITAN No.
ELAINE So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week.
LEVITAN Nudist colony?
ELAINE Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. Aah!
LEVITAN I'd never been to a nudist colony.
ELAINE Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. Of course, when it's over, it's - it's hard to get used to all this clothing, you know. So, a lot of times, I'll just lock the door to my office and I'll just sit there naked.
LEVITAN Seriously?
ELAINE Oh, yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day.
GEORGE Glenda, can I ask you a favor? Can I have this seat?
GLENDA What do you have to sit here for? There are plenty of other seats.
GEORGE I can't explain. It's very important that I sit here.
GLENDA What are you doing here anyway? I thought you were fired.
GEORGE Okay. Okay. Fine.
ELAINE I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. Naked. Naked. Naked.
LEVITAN Who are you?
ELAINE Oh, you don't wanna know, mistah. I'm trouble. Big trouble.
JERRY What about the gentle cycle? You ever use that?
JERRY Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle cycle?
JERRY What about fine fabrics? How do you deal with that kind of temperament?
JERRY What about stone washing? You ever witness one of those? That must be something. What? Do they just pummel the jeans with rocks?
KRAMER I didn't realize it was a full box.
GEORGE I'm gonna count to three. If you don't give up the chair, the wig is coming off.
GLENDA I don't' wear a wig.
GEORGE One...
ELAINE No. No. No. No. No. I don't really have a phone. In fact, I - I really don't have an apartment. I kinda sleep around.
ELAINE I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy do whatever he wants. Would you close your eyes for a second? I wanna tell you a secret about my bra.
GEORGE Hello, Rick.
LEVITAN Heh heh heh hey! Look who's here!
GEORGE That's right, Ricky Boy, it's me!
LEVITAN You know something, Costanza? I'm a very lucky man.
GEORGE Oh!
LEVITAN I've always been lucky. Things just seem to fall right in my lap.
GEORGE Boom!
LEVITAN You wouldn't believe it if I told you. In fact, uh, I'm glad you're here. You know, maybe I've been a little rough on ya, huh?
GEORGE Oh.
LEVITAN Why should we let petty, personal differences get in the way of business? I, uh, I want you to come back. You can use my bathroom anytime you want.
GEORGE You want me to come back? Uh...
LEVITAN Hey! How about a toast, huh? Everybody, a toast!
GEORGE Rick.
LEVITAN Everyone, I wanna propose a toast to ten great years at Rick Barr Properties.
GEORGE Uh, Rick..
LEVITAN And all the people in this room, that made that possible..
GEORGE Rick.
LEVITAN I'd also like to welcome back into the fold our..our little shrimpy friend, George Costanza who, although he didn't really have a very good year -- how you blew that McConnell deal, I'll never know. But, hey, what the hell, huh? We've always enjoyed his antics around the office. Heh heh. Anything you wanna add to this?
GEORGE Drink up. I like history. Civil War. Maybe I could be a professor, or something.
ELAINE Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot about it. I think you need a degree.
JERRY Yeah. That's true. What? My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd you find it?
KRAMER It was in my laundry.
JERRY In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in our guys. What did we figure the damage on that machine would be?
KRAMER It was about 1200 bucks.
NEWMAN Kramer!
KRAMER Oh! That's Newman.
NEWMAN I'm on the roof!
KRAMER Well, what are you waiting for?
JERRY Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat. I gotta pay this guy the money..
GEORGE I like horses. Maybe I could be a stable boy.
KRAMER You wanna shoot some pool tonight?
NEWMAN I can't. I'm goin' to the movies.
GEORGE Nah. It's probably a union thing.
GEORGE Why is there no haggling in this country?
JERRY I guess we like to think we've progressed beyond a knife fight for a citrus drink.
GEORGE Not me. Everything should be negotiable.
JERRY Restaurants too?
GEORGE Absolutely. You're telling me there's no room to move on pasta. All starches are a scam.
JERRY Yea especially zedi, with that big hole.
GEORGE Excuse me, how much is this?
WORKER Dollar nineteen.
GEORGE I'll give you a quarter.
WORKER Get the hell out of here.
JERRY Tell him forty and no fork.
GEORGE Thirty.
WORKER That's it you leave and never come back!
JERRY How about we leave and come back in a week?
WORKER Deal!
GEORGE Alright see? We got something there.
JERRY Look at the size of that neon light.
KRAMER Roger's can't sell chicken around here, we got chicken places on every block.
JERRY He is the gambler.
KRAMER Well, I gotta meet Newman at the pet store. Helping him pick out a turtle.
JERRY Try and stay calm.
KRAMER Yea, yea.
MAN Hey Jerry.
JERRY Seth! Wow what has it been like five years?
SETH At least.
JERRY You wanna grab lunch?
SETH Uh, I'm actually headed back to the office.
JERRY Seth it's me. What's more important than catching up with an old college buddy?
SETH Well, I am supposed to be in this meeting.
JERRY Blow it off. Remember Poli Sci? How many of those did we go to?
SETH_AND_JERRY Alright, alright.
JERRY Whatever happened to Moochie?
SETH He's dead.
JERRY Is that right?
GEORGE I still don't understand how you can call lunch with me a business expense.
ELAINE What do you think of the catalog?
GEORGE It stinks.
ELAINE There, we just talked business.
WORKER We do have the down comforter and the cookware you liked.
ELAINE Oh great, put it all on the Peterman account with the other stuff.
WORKER You know what else we have that you might like?
ELAINE I'll take it.
GEORGE Hey, you like?
WORKER I think that looks very nice on you.
GEORGE Really? Elaine...Peterman account?
ELAINE Why not? And some hair for my little friend here.
SETH So how's your stand up career?
JERRY Pretty good, as a matter of fact. I almost had my own show in Japan.
SETH You speak Japanese?
JERRY No
SETH So you would have done it in Japan, but in English.
JERRY I don't know. So what's this job of yours?
SETH Big investment firm. We just got the Citibank account. In fact today was our first big meeting with them.
JERRY The meeting you blew off?
SETH Yea.
JERRY Wasn't that kind of important?
SETH Yea.
ELAINE ...and I brought I whole new set of cookware, and a water pic.
JERRY You use a water pick?
ELAINE Sure, water pic, floss, plax, brush, listerine...
JERRY So you go in the bathroom at eleven your in bed by what two?
ELAINE Well, at the latest. Oh hang on a second, I gotta another call.
ELAINE Hello?
MAN Good day Ms Benes, this is Roger Ipswitch.
ELAINE Oh hey! How are things doing in accounting?
ROGER Ms. Benes, I noticed you have been charging quite a bit of merchandise on the Peterman account.
ELAINE Well, I am the President.
ROGER Yes, and we're all very impressed. Never the less the expense account is for business purposes only.
ELAINE Well, isn't the president allowed to do anything that they want?
ROGER No, I'll be in your office first thing tomorrow. Good day.
ELAINE Good day.
JERRY Hello, anybody?
GEORGE Hey.
JERRY Hey, why didn't you get the big one?
GEORGE This hat just bottles in the heat, I don't even need a coat! It's unbelievable!
JERRY I don't believe it.
GEORGE And I got a date with the sales woman. She's got a little Marisa Tomei thing going on.
JERRY Ah, too bad you got a little George Costanza thing going on.
GEORGE I'm going out with her tomorrow, she said she had some errands to run.
JERRY That's a date?
GEORGE What's the difference? You know they way I work, I'm like a commercial jingle. First it's a little irritating, then you hear it a few times, you hum it in the shower, by the third date it's "By Mennen!".
JERRY How do you make sure your gonna get to the third date?
GEORGE If there's any doubt, I do a leave-behind keys, glove, scarf, I go back to her place to pick it up...date number three.
JERRY That's so old. Why don't you show up at her door in a wood horse?
JERRY "By Mennen"
JERRY What's going on in there?
KRAMER What?
JERRY The light!
KRAMER Oh the red, its the chicken roaster sign, its right across my window.
JERRY Can't you shut the shades?
KRAMER They are shut, oh yea your friend Seth stopped by.
JERRY Yea? What'd he say?
KRAMER he was fired.
ELAINE Well, as you can see the comforter I expensed is actually the Aristotle goose down tunic. So what do you think?
ROGER Another bulls eye.
ELAINE Well Mr. Ipswitch since everyone of my expenses are obviously for a legitimate business purpose.
ROGER I just need to see the sable hat you purchased yesterday.
ELAINE The hat? Why do you need to see the hat?
ROGER Because it costs eight-thousand dollars.
ELAINE What?
JERRY Seth, if you knew the meeting was so important why did you go the lunch with me?
SETH We're old college buddies.
JERRY I only knew you through Moochie.
SETH Hey Jerry don't worry about it, the important thing is that we got to catch up. Mind if I grab the want ads?
JERRY Actually I haven't read Tank McNamara yet.
JERRY How's life on the red planet?
KRAMER Its killing me, I can't eat, I can't sleep, all I can see is that giant red sun in the shape of a chicken.
JERRY Well, did you go down to the Kenny Rogers and complain?
KRAMER Ah, they have me the heave ho. I don't think that Kenny Rogers has any idea what's going on down there.
JERRY What are you doing?
KRAMER Getting some cereal
JERRY That's tomato juice.
KRAMER That looked like milk to me! Jerry my Rods and Cones are all screwed up! Alright, that's it I gotta move in with you Jerry.
JERRY I don't know Kramer, my only concern is that ....
JERRY ..living together after a while we might start to get on each others nerves a little.
KRAMER Alright listen to me, I got a great idea. You're a heavy sleeper, right? Why don't we switch apartments?
JERRY Or I could sleep in the park? You could knock these walls down, make it an eight room luxury suite.
KRAMER Jerry these are lode baring walls, they're not gonna come down!
JERRY Yea, that's no good.
KRAMER I may have to drive that place out of business.
JERRY How you gonna do that?
KRAMER Like we did in the sixties, takin' in to the streets.
WOMAN Thanks George, but I got it from here.
GEORGE Oh no I'm in already come on.
GEORGE So you want to get together tomorrow?
WOMAN No, I'm gonna be pretty busy.
GEORGE What about this weekend?
WOMAN I'm gonna be busy for a while.
GEORGE OK, see ya!
WOMAN Hey, you forgot your keys.
GEORGE What, those aren't my keys.
WOMAN Well they're not mine.
GEORGE Oh, they are my keys, how weird.
WOMAN Bye George.
GEORGE Yea.
WOMAN George, bye!
GEORGE Costanza.
ELAINE What do you mean you don't have the hat?
GEORGE I left it at Heather's. Are these alive?
ELAINE No dead! George, I need that Russian hat back!
GEORGE Alright, alright ,I'll call Heather, you'll get your hat back, I will get a second date. Ha ha. Now watch the magic. Dial 9- MERLIN.
HEATHER Hello?
GEORGE Heather Hi, it's George Costanza.
HEATHER Oy!
GEORGE Ah , listen. I don't mean to bother you but, silly me, I think I may have left my hat in your apartment. So I thought I'd just come by later and pick it up.
HEATHER You didn't' leave a hat here.
GEORGE I'm pretty sure I left it behind the cushion of the chair ... accidentally.
HEATHER No hat. George I gotta go.
GEORGE You know maybe ... I'll ...
JERRY Seth?
SETH Jerry Hi! What do you think?
JERRY I think your taking the trash out for this chicken place, but that couldn't be.
SETH Yea, I'm the new manager
JERRY But your were an executive, this is fast food.
SETH Not fast food, good food served quickly.
KRAMER Hey, stay away from the chicken, bad chicken, mess you up.
SETH That's not going to be good for business.
JERRY That's not going to be good for anybody.
JERRY If I'm gonna live over there, you gotta take some of this stuff out. I mean this thing is really freaking me out. I feel like its gonna come to life in the middle of the night and kill me.
KRAMER Mr. Marbles? He's harmless.
JERRY And one other thing, I don't want Newman using my...
JERRY Oh no.
NEWMAN Nice place you got here Kramer a man can really get some thinking done.
JERRY Well don't get too comfortable, as soon as Seth gets a real job you two are gong back in that chicken supernova.
KRAMER What is that Roger's Chicken? Oh get that outta here.
NEWMAN I don't know. The man makes a pretty strong bird.
KRAMER Well I'm boycotting it.
KRAMER What is that, hickory?
NEWMAN Yea, it's the wood that makes it good.
KRAMER Really?
NEWMAN Uh-Huh.
KRAMER Oh stop it.
HEATHER Can I help you?
ELAINE Hi, yea, I'm Elaine Benes, we met at Barney's, I'm a friend of George Costanza's. Whether you're aware of it or not George had this pathetic little plan to leave something behind so he could weazel a second date.
HEATHER Really?
ELAINE I know, he has a real confidence problem.
GEORGE Well not really...
ELAINE George...Anyway I know you told him you didn't have the hat because you didn't want to see him again. And, more sympathetic I could not be. But I really do need to have that hat back.
HEATHER Look, I don't know what to tell you, but there's no hat here. I mean, maybe the maid took it, I had people over, but...
GEORGE Well that makes sense.
ELAINE Then you wouldn't mind if we took a second look around?
HEATHER Be my guest.
GEORGE Good to see you again.
GEORGE She's bluffing, she's got it stashed away in there somewhere.
ELAINE This is an absolute disaster.
GEORGE Oh, I don't know. Check this out.
ELAINE You stole her clock?
ELAINE Well done.
GEORGE Yep, this one for our side! .
JERRY What is that creaking, its like I'm in the hold of a ship. Gotta relax.
JERRY Hello, is somebody there? Mr. Marbles?
ELAINE So I told Ipswitch I'd have the hat by this afternoon, what am I gonna do?
KRAMER You should sleep with him.
JERRY Hey everybody, I'm on no sleep, no sleep!. You don't know what it's like in there, all night long things are creeping and cracking. And that red light is burning my brain!
ELAINE You look a little stressed.
JERRY Oh I'm stressed!
ELAINE So Kramer what am I supposed to do? If I don't have that fur hat by four o'clock they're gonna take me down like Nixon.
JERRY You know my friend Bob Sacamano?
ELAINE I thought he was Kramer's friend.
JERRY Well, he called last night about 3 a.m. we got to talking, he sells Russian hats down at battery park, forty bucks.
ELAINE fourty bucks? Are they Sable?
JERRY No, but the difference is unnoticeable.
KRAMER Oh yea, I like this idea.
ELAINE Alright, lets give it a shot, lets go.
JERRY Giddee up!
NEWMAN It's getting cold, it's getting cold.
KRAMER That was a close one.
NEWMAN Why do we have to keep this a secret from Jerry?
KRAMER If Jerry finds out I'm hooked on Roger's chicken I'm back there with the red menace.
IPSWITCH Ms. Benes the hat you charged to the company was Sable, this is Neutria.
ELAINE Well, that's a kind of sable.
IPSWITCH No, its a kind of rat.
ELAINE That's a rat hat?
IPSWITCH And a poorly made one, even by rat hat standards. I have no choice but to recommend your prompt termination to the board of directors nothing short of the approval of Peterman himself will save you this time.
ELAINE But, but, he's in the Burmese jungle.
IPSWITCH Yes, and quite mad from what I hear.
ELAINE Wait? Can I fire you?
IPSWITCH No.
KRAMER So Heather called?
GEORGE Yea, but get this, the message said 'call me if you have the time'. Heh heh if I have the time, you get it?
KRAMER No, but this is all very exciting.
GEORGE She knows that I have her clock, I know that she has my hat, I think she's getting ready to make an exchange.
KRAMER Of course there's the possibility that you've gone right out of your mind.
GEORGE I've looked at that, seems unlikely.
KRAMER I'd look again. So, how come you didn't call Jerry about all this?
GEORGE I can't talk to Jerry anymore, even since he moved into that apartment he's too much ... like you.
KRAMER That's a shame.
JERRY Seth, you're the manager, can't you turn off the sign?
SETH Jerry, I lied, I'm just he assistant manager.
SETH Number sixty seven, family feast.
NEWMAN Number 67, right here, right here!
JERRY Hello Newman.
NEWMAN Hello Jerry.
SETH And don't forget your steamed broccoli.
JERRY Hold it, Newman, you wouldn't eat broccoli if it was deep fried in chocolate sauce.
NEWMAN I love broccoli, its good for you.
JERRY Really? Then maybe you'd like to have a piece?
NEWMAN Gladly.
NEWMAN Vile weed!
JERRY It's Kramer isn't it? The greasy door knob the constant licking of the fingers, he's hooked to the chicken isn't he?
NEWMAN Yes, now please. Someone, honey mustard.
KRAMER Newman, what took you so long, oh hey buddy.
JERRY Expecting Newman? That's funny because I happened to find him at Kenny Roger's Roasters.
KRAMER Kenny Roger's? Whew, boy, I hate that place.
JERRY He was buying quite a load of chicken almost for two people, as long as one of them is not him.
KRAMER Oh hey Elaine stopped by, yea dropped off that Bob Sacamano hat, oh she's upset at him, oh yes siree. Yea well thanks for stopping by.
JERRY I sure do miss my apartment maybe I'll switch back.
KRAMER Oh you don't want to think about that no sir. Otherwise I'd have no choice but to put that banner back up and run that Roger's right out of town.
JERRY I don't think you will. As a matter of fact I'll save you the trouble, I'll do it myself.
KRAMER Yea, yea go ahead put the banner up doesn't matter to me.
JERRY Alright.
KRAMER No Jerry! I need that chicken, I gotta have that chicken, you leave those roasters alone, Kenny never hurt anybody.
JERRY You got a little problem.
KRAMER Oh I got a big problem Jerry!
PETERMAN Elaine.
ELAINE Mr. Peterman.
ELAINE You speak Burmese?
PETERMAN No Elaine, that was gibberish. So did you have any trouble finding the place?
ELAINE No, you're the only white poet warlord in the neighborhood.
PETERMAN Are you an assassin?
ELAINE I work for your mail order catalog.
PETERMAN You're an errand girl, sent by grocery clerks, to collect a bill.
ELAINE Well, actually I do have a bill here, if you could just sign this expense, I think I could still make the last fan boat out of here.
PETERMAN I'd be happy to Elaine ... but I will have to see this hat.
GEORGE So how do you want to do this?
HEATHER Alright George I'll be honest, the first time we went out, I found you very irritating, but after seeing you for a couple of times, you sorta got stuck in my head, Costanza!
GEORGE So you really don't have my hat?
HEATHER What?
GEORGE Oh. let's go do something.
HEATHER What's in bag?
GEORGE That's a sandwich.
GEORGE Damn salami.
HEATHER My clock, you stole it!
GEORGE That damn deli that is last time they screw up one of my orders. wet
JERRY Hey Seth, man it is coming down hard out there.
JERRY Oh, gross. That's not gonna be good for business.
SETH That's not gonna be good for anybody.
KRAMER Kenny? ... Kenny?
KRAMER Kenny....
JERRY Home at last.
JERRY Is someone there? Mr. Marbles?
ELAINE Its the Urban Sombrero, I put it in the last catalog.
PETERMAN The horror...the horror.
JERRY You can always tell what was the best year of your father's life, because they seem to just freeze that clothing style and just ride it out to the end, don't they? And it's not like they don't continue shopping, it's just they somehow manage to find new old clothes. Every father is like this fashion time capsule, you know what I mean. It's like they should be on a pedestal, with someone next to 'em going 'This was nineteen sixty-five'. To me the worst thing is shopping for pants. I hate dressing and undressing in that little room. What men need is a place to shop where you go in, you check your pants at the door, and you just walk around the store in your underwear. That would be the best way. Then you'd really have to lie to the salesman. 'Need some help?' 'No, just getting some air.'
JERRY How would you describe the smell in this house?
ELAINE Dandruff?
JERRY Yeah, that's part of it. Kasha?
ELAINE There's some kasha.
JERRY Yeah. Dandruff, kasha, mothballs, cheap carpeting. It's pot pourri, really.
ELAINE Alright, let's go, come on.
GEORGE Wha... you're going?
ELAINE Yeah. You know we shouldn't have bowled that last game, I'm gonna be late.
KRAMER Egh. These aren't candies.
GEORGE Kramer. did you use those? These are guest soaps!
KRAMER Well I'm a guest.
GEORGE Now my parents are gonna know I had people over.
JERRY You're not allowed to have people over?
GEORGE I can't have any parties while they're out of town.
KRAMER What, this is a party?
ELAINE Not any more. Come on, get your ball, we're leaving. Let's go, let's go.
GEORGE Wow! Who put this cup right on the new table!
JERRY I was having coffee, I put it on the coffee table.
GEORGE But you didn't use a coaster, Jerry, you left a stain!
KRAMER Whoah boy. There's always one at every party, huh?
ELAINE Come on!
JERRY What's the big rush?
ELAINE I'm having people over.
JERRY Who?
ELAINE The girls for poker night. You know, Joanne, Renee, Winona...
JERRY Eh, eh, ah. Winona's gonna be there?
ELAINE Yeah. And she broke up with the vitamin guy.
JERRY Really?
ELAINE I'll put in a good word for you.
JERRY Thanks, because I would really like...
GEORGE Aaahh!!
JERRY Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
GEORGE But Jerry, this is not coming out!
JERRY Just put a coffee table book over it.
GEORGE My parents don't read! They're gonna wonder what a book is doing on the table!
KRAMER Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know what would make a great coffee table book? A coffee table book about coffee tables! Get it?
ELAINE Got it! C'mon, let's go, let's go. Bye George.
GEORGE Wait, wait wait, not so fast. Jerry, you gotta take me to get this thing refinished.
ELAINE Now?!
GEORGE Yes, now. It's gonna take a few days and my parents are gonna be back. I gotta have it back before them!
ELAINE Jerry, you promised you'd get me home by seven.
KRAMER Alright, we'll take the subway.
JERRY There you go. That'll get you home in time.
ELAINE Oh! The subway? From Queens?
GEORGE Alright, Jerry, I'm gonna get my coat.
JERRY I'm sorry Elaine, I'll make it up to you.
ELAINE I need something to read on the subway.
JERRY Here, read this.
ELAINE TV Guide?
KRAMER I got history of coffee tables, celebrities and their coffee tables. It's a natural. This is a story that must be told.
ELAINE Hmm-mmm.
KRAMER So, you're gonna talk to your boss about it, huh?
ELAINE Hmm-mmm. First thing in the morning.
KRAMER Yes indeed.
TANNOY Next stop, Queensboro Plaza.
KRAMER Oh, Queensboro Plaza. This stop is famous for its gyros, you want one?
ELAINE How are you gonna get something and get back on the train in time?
KRAMER Well, they got a stand right out on the platform. Gyros are cooked, and wrapped, and ready to go. Three dollars, no change. You want one?
ELAINE No thanks.
KRAMER Alright, but no bites.
RICKY Highlighter?
ELAINE Excuse me?
RICKY To highlight the programmes you plan to watch.
ELAINE Ah. Uh, look really I'm just trying to read.
RICKY Fine, okay. It's just, I've never seen a beautiful lady reading 'the Guide' so far away from a TV. You must really like television.
KRAMER Elaine!
RICKY Guess your boyfriend'll have to catch the next train.
ELAINE He's not my boyfriend.
RICKY He's not? Interesting.
JERRY Hey, maybe I should get Elaine something.
GEORGE Why?
JERRY Ah, you know, I didn't drive her home. Plus, I give her a gift in front of Winona, how does that hurt me?
GEORGE Can't hurt you.
JERRY What about, what about this thing?
GEORGE The Indian?
JERRY Yeah. You know, kind of a peace offering. Cute.
GEPETTO Well, I can have the table ready for you on Monday.
GEORGE Alright, but no later, because my parents are coming back.
GEPETTO They left you home alone, huh?
RICKY Oh, 'kay, see. On this particular Tuesday you could've watched six hours of Lucy. There's I Love Lucy, The Lucy Show, Here's Lucy.
ELAINE Oh, my stop. Bye-bye.
RICKY Hey miss! You forgot this!
GEPETTO They don't make these any more. The work is, is all done by hand. Takes years, and years, and... Sylvia! For crying out, you're forty-five minutes late!
SYLVIA Yeah, yeah. Is that your car out there?
GEORGE No, it's, it's his.
SYLVIA Oh, nice. You guys are obviously from Manhattan.
GEORGE Well, he is. I, uh, I live around the corner.
SYLVIA Really? Ah, I didn't think any cool guys lived in this neighbourhood.
GEORGE Well, they do now. Neighbourhood's changing.
JERRY Alright, I'll take it.
GEPETTO Smart choice.
SYLVIA Wow, you bought the Indian? Oh, you guys have great taste.
GEORGE Well, we're collectors. We, uh, see objects of great beauty and, uh, we must have them.
ELAINE Knocked you out Jack. Pair of deuces
THE_GIRLS Oh/Aah.
ELAINE Ha, ha, ha ha!
ELAINE Who is it?
JERRY It's Jerry.
ELAINE Jerry!
JERRY Surprise!
ELAINE What is this?
JERRY Well, I felt bad about this afternoon, so I got you something.
ELAINE Oh, you did? Oh, do you guys all know Jerry?
THE_GIRLS Hi Jerry/Hello.
JERRY Hi. Hi Winona. Nice to see you again.
GIRL Elaine, is it your birthday?
ELAINE No.
JERRY I don't need a reason to give gifts, it's my nature. I love to make people happy.
THE_GIRLS Aww/That's so sweet.
JERRY Are you ready?
ELAINE Yeah.
JERRY Ta-da!
JERRY It's a cigar store Indian. Read the card.
ELAINE That's very nice. Thank you very much.
JERRY Read it out loud.
ELAINE I, I don't think so.
JERRY We had a little fight this afternoon. Let's bury the hatchet. We smoke um peace pipe.
WINONA Hey, you know, it's late. I really should go.
ELAINE I, uh, I don't blame you Winona. I, uh...
JERRY Hey-yah, ho-ah, hey-yah, ho-ah.
ELAINE Are you out of your mind?!
JERRY ...ho-ah. It's, it's, it's kitschy.
ELAINE Winona is a Native American.
JERRY She is?
SYLVIA You got very unusual taste.
GEORGE I hope prune juice is alright. It's the only thing I had that was chilled.
SYLVIA Fine.
GEORGE I'm sorry about that lock on the liquor cabinet. The combination musta just flown outta my head. It's a mental block.
SYLVIA Ahh! Is this your son in the bubble bath?
GEORGE No, that's me.
SYLVIA Oh. You don't see many guys your age who keep baby pictures of themselves around. I like it. Consistent with the rest of the house.
GEORGE Yes, it is consistent. I've, uh, I've tried to maintain a consistent feel throughout the house.
SYLVIA What is this we're listening to?
GEORGE The Ray Conniff Singers.
SYLVIA Mmmm, what's that smell? Kasha?
GEORGE It's a pot pourri. May I, uh, may I show you the master bedroom?
WINONA Who is it?
JERRY Uh, Winona, it's Jerry Seinfeld.
WINONA Yeah?
JERRY Uhm, listen, I really felt bad about what happened, and I, I, I'd really like to apologise. Can I come up?
WINONA I'll come down.
KRAMER I came by to get my ball.
ELAINE It's right over there.
KRAMER Oh, yeah, thanks. Yeah, it's got the magic grip. How d'you think I bowled that two-twenty today, huh? Yo! Where did this come from?
ELAINE You want it?
KRAMER I can have this?!
ELAINE Yuh! You wanna lug it uptown, it's yours.
KRAMER Oh. I'll lug.
WINONA It's just that it's a very sensitive issue for me.
JERRY And well it should be. I think if you spent any time with me at all, you'd see I'm very sensitive to these matters as well. You wouldn't be hungry by any chance, wouldya?
WINONA I guess I could go for a bite.
JERRY You like Chinese food, 'cos I once went to a great Szechwan restaurant in this neighbourhood. I don't remember the exact address... Uh, excuse me, you must know where the Chinese restaurant is around here.
MAILMAN Why must I know? Because I'm Chinese? You think I know where all the Chinese restaurants are? Oh, ask honolable Chinaman for rocation of lestaulant.
JERRY I asked because you were the mailman, you would know the neighbourhood.
MAILMAN Oh, hello American Joe. Which way to hamburger, hotdog stand?
JERRY I didn't know that...
WINONA You know, it's late. I should probably just go home.
JERRY I, I had no idea.
KRAMER Hey Jerry! Look what I got!
GEORGE Looks pretty good.
JERRY Yeah, did a good job.
GEORGE Yeah. I don't think they'll be able to tell.
JERRY You know, I don't get it. Not allowed to ask a Chinese person where the
GEORGE So, anyway, what's uh, what's the status with, uh...
JERRY Ah, she kinda calmed down. I talked to her today. In fact I'm gonna see her tonight.
GEORGE Oh, great.
JERRY Yeah, but I'm a little uncomfortable. I'm afraid of making another mistake.
GEORGE Aw c'mon.
ESTELLE Hello, hello!
GEORGE Ahh, hey you're home. Hi.
ESTELLE Oh, the house looks very nice.
GEORGE Yeah, huh.
FRANK Where's the mail?
ESTELLE Hello Jerry.
JERRY Hello.
GEORGE So, how was the trip?
ESTELLE Ah, your father...
FRANK Is there anything wrong with getting a receipt at a toll booth?
ESTELLE I'm going upstairs.
FRANK This stack should be bigger, where's the TV Guide?
GEORGE What TV Guide?
FRANK I'm missing TV Guide volume forty-one, number thirty-one.
JERRY Uh, Elaine took it to read on the subway.
FRANK Elaine took it?
GEORGE I didn't know she took it!
JERRY Wa, it's two weeks old.
FRANK How could you let her take the TV Guide?!
GEORGE He collects them.
JERRY You collect TV Guide?
FRANK The nerve of that woman. Walking into my house, stealing my collectible!
ESTELLE Oh my God! This was in our bed.
FRANK What is this? A prophylactic wrapper?!
ESTELLE What is this doing on my bed?!
GEORGE I don't know, uh...
JERRY I'll see you later.
FRANK You were having sex on our bed?!
GEORGE Yes!
ESTELLE Who told you you could have sex in our bed?
GEORGE Well, my bed is too small.
FRANK Your bed is too small? I'm gone two weeks and you turn our house into, into Bourbon Street!
ESTELLE Where am I going to sleep?
GEORGE What're you talking about?
ESTELLE I can't sleep in there!
GEORGE Of course you can.
ESTELLE I can't! I can't!
FRANK That's it! You're grounded!
GEORGE You can't ground me, I'm a grown man.
FRANK You wanna live here? You respect the rules of our house. You're grounded!
WINONA So, where are we gonna go eat?
JERRY I thought we'd eat at the Gentle Harvest.
WINONA Ooh, I love that place, but it's usually so crowded. Can we get a table?
JERRY Ah, don't worry. I made reser...
WINONA You made what?
JERRY I uh, I uh, I arranged for the appropriate accommodation. And then, Knick tickets, floor seats.
WINONA How did you get these?
JERRY Got 'em on the street, from a scal... A uh, one of those guys.
WINONA What guys?
JERRY You know, the guys, that uh, they sell the tickets for the sold-out events.
WINONA Oh.
JERRY Wait a second, you got the Mark McEwan TV Guide.
WINONA That's Al Roker.
JERRY Oh well, they're both chubby weathermen. I get Dom Deluise and Paul Prudhoe mixed up too. Could I have this?
WINONA Sure, take it.
JERRY Thanks.
JERRY So, Winona had the TV Guide. Told you I'd make it up to you.
ELAINE Aah, so Mr Costanza was pretty mad, huh?
JERRY Yeah. You almost ruined his life's work.
ELAINE He collects these?
JERRY Yeah.
ELAINE Wow! Alright, well I will personally go out to Queens and deliver his Al Roker TV Guide to him.
JERRY What'ya do with the one you took?
ELAINE I dunno.
ELAINE Hi.
KRAMER Yeah uh, Elaine uh, what'd he say?
ELAINE What did who say?
KRAMER Your boss. Didn't you tell him about the coffee table book?
ELAINE Uhmm...
KRAMER Yeah, you didn't tell him didya?
ELAINE Kramer, it is such a dumb idea. I would be totally embarrassed to bring it...
KRAMER Wait a minute, on the cover I'm...
ELAINE I would be embarrassed to bring it up.
JERRY I thought it was a pretty good idea. It's about coffee tables, it's on a coffee table.
KRAMER Yeah, right, right, and on the cover is a built-in coaster. Alright, well I'm gonna go.
JERRY Where you going?
KRAMER Well, I'm gonna go to the cigar stores. I'm gonna see if I can sell that Indian.
JERRY My Indian?
KRAMER You know, I think it's worth something. It's kitschy.
FRANK How do you just walk into a house and take a TV Guide? How does she expect you to watch TV? Am I just supposed to turn it on and wander aimlessly around the dial?
RICKY Hello. Is Elaine home?
ESTELLE Elaine Benes? Oh, she's my son's friend.
FRANK And she's not welcome in this house!
RICKY Oh, 'cos I made her this very special gift. 'Kay, it's a bouquet of paper from her TV Guide.
FRANK That's my TV Guide! Ripped to shreds! She gave that to you?!
RICKY Hey, is that the Twilight Zone you're watching?
GEORGE Yeah.
RICKY Oh, this is a good one.
TANNOY Next stop, Queensboro Plaza.
ELAINE Mmm, gyro.
WINONA I like your place. It's very unassuming.
JERRY Well, why would I assume. I never assume. Leads to assumptions.
WINONA Oh, by the way. That TV Guide I gave you, I need it back.
JERRY Why?
WINONA Well, I'm doing a report on minorities in the media, and I wanted to use that interview with Al Roker.
JERRY Well, it's too late. I gave it to Elaine, and she's already on her way to give it to George's father.
WINONA Jerry, I really need it back. It, it is mine.
JERRY You can't give something and then take it back. I mean, what are you...
WINONA What?
JERRY A uh, a person that uh...
WINONA A person that what?
JERRY Well, a person that gives something and then they're dissatisfied and they wish they had, had never uh...
WINONA And?
JERRY ...give, given it to the person that they originally gave it to.
WINONA You mean like, an Indian giver?!
JERRY I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that term.
RICKY I like the special fall preview issues the best.
FRANK Those. I've been saving those from the beginning. The doorbell rings.
RICKY These are worth like, a lot of money.
ESTELLE Oh, hello Elaine!
ELAINE Hello.
RICKY Elaine! Hello! You look scrumptious.
FRANK Why'd you take my TV Guide?
ELAINE I'm so sorry about that Mr Costanza, but look. Look, I brought you another one.
RICKY I made this for you.
ELAINE Oh, thank you.
FRANK What is this? You got stains all over it! What the hell'd you do?
RICKY Hey, you can't talk to her like that.
FRANK I'll talk to her any way I want!
RICKY Come on Elaine, let's go.
ESTELLE My coffee table!
KRAMER I don't understand. How can you have a cigar store, without an Indian? It's unseemly.
SPIKE I'll give you a box of Coronas for it.
KRAMER Forget it.
LIPPMAN Uh, excuse me. Are you uh, selling this Indian?
KRAMER Oh yeah, yeah.
LIPPMAN Uh, I'm just uh, redecorating my office in a south-western motif and this'd be perfect. Give you five hundred dollars for it?
KRAMER Giddyup.
LIPPMAN Yeah? Could you help me bring it up to my office, I'm right next door. Pendant Publishing.
KRAMER Pendant Publishing? Giddyup again.
ELAINE Mr Lippman. I'm sorry, I was in Queens uh... Kramer!
KRAMER Yeah, hi Elaine.
ELAINE What are you doing in here with that?
KRAMER Ah, well, it's a business transaction.
LIPPMAN Listen uh, petty cash just had tens and twenties. Go ahead, count it.
KRAMER Yeah, I'm sure it's all here. You know I was just admiring your coffee table, out there in the hall.
LIPPMAN You like that, huh? I had that custom made for me in Santa Fe.
KRAMER You mind if I use it in my book?
LIPPMAN What book?
KRAMER Well, I'm doing a coffee table book on coffee tables.
LIPPMAN About coffee tables?
KRAMER Uh huh.
LIPPMAN That's fantastic. Who's your publisher?
KRAMER Well, I'm still shopping it around.
LIPPMAN Yeah? You see, this is the kind of idea you should be coming in with. What the hell do you do round here all day anyway?
ELAINE Well I ...manuscript that I...
LIPPMAN God, that Indian really completes the room. Don't you think?
SYLVIA I know this coffee table, it's George Costanza's.
ESTELLE It's mine. I'm his mother.
SYLVIA Oh, I haven't seen George for a while. He must be working very hard.
ESTELLE George doesn't work. He's a bum. That's why he lives at home with us.
SYLVIA He does?
JERRY I don't know why we didn't think of this before. We just could call
TV Guide.
ELAINE I dunno.
JERRY Well, it's gonna make Mr Costanza very happy.
ELAINE I guess.
JERRY What's the matter?
ELAINE What d'you think is the matter? I've been assigned to work on Kramer's coffee table book.
JERRY It is a good idea, Elaine.
TANNOY Next stop, Queensboro Plaza.
JERRY You want a gyro?
ELAINE I don't think so.
JERRY Elaine!
AL_ROKER Guess your boyfriend's gonna have to catch the next train.
ELAINE He's not my boyfriend.
AL_ROKER He's not? Interesting.
JERRY I was always excited as a kid, when that new TV Guide would come. Somehow when that front cover's nice and flat, seems like there's good fresh TV shows in. Then, as the weeks go by you start to hate the TV Guide. All the shows stink. Everything's getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on, thrown across the room. TV Guide is always thrown, never handed, to another person. It's the world's most thrown reading material. 'Where's TV Guide?' 'There it is.' You know in the back of the TV Guide, they have a phone number, ninety-five cents a minute, they will give you the answers to the
TV Guide crossword puzzle? My question is, if you can't do the
TV Guide crossword puzzle, where are you coming across ninety-five cents?
JERRY To me, the thing about birthday parties is that the first birthday party you have and the last birthday party you have are actually quite similar. You know, you just kinda sit there...you're the least excited person at the party. You don't even really realize that there is a party. You don't know what's goin' on. Both birthday parties, people have to kinda help you blow out the candles, you can't do it...you don't even know why you're doing it. What is this ritual? What is going on? It's also the only two birthday parties where other people have to gather your friends together for you. Sometimes they're not even your friends. They make the judgement. They bring 'em in, they sit 'em down, and they tell you - 'these are your friends! Tell them thank you for coming to my birthday party.'
TOBY These are great! Just great! Really great! Really, really great! Don't you think so, Elaine?
ELAINE Yeah, really great.
TOBY A coffee table book about coffee tables! How did you come up with this idea?
KRAMER It was there!
TOBY Oh, look at this one! It's saying, 'I'm a coffee table, put some coffee on me! Oh, the hotter the better, that's what I'm here for!'
ELAINE Actually, I've got some work I gotta do, so...
KRAMER Hey, how about if the book came with these little fold-out legs...so the book itself becomes a coffee table?
TOBY Ohhh, that is a great idea! Really, really great!
ELAINE 'And that coffee table is saying, put some coffee on me!' I'd like to put some coffee on her. Hot, scalding coffee - right in her face! I swear! This is like working with a contestant from "The Price Is Right"!
JERRY Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you think this is funny - "Men definitely hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV. Women want to see what the show is before they change the channel, because men hunt and women nest."
ELAINE Yeah, it's funny, I dunno.
JERRY You don't know? Come on, that's gold!
ELAINE Well, I don't know about "gold."
JERRY Oh, that's gold, baby.
ELAINE 'Baby'? What, are you doing George now?
JERRY I was saying 'baby' way before George!
ELAINE Well, I don't know, don't ask me any more questions about jokes, Jerry, it puts too much pressure on me.
JERRY Well, this guy Leonard Christian's gonna be there tomorrow night.
ELAINE Yeah, who's he?
JERRY He's a writer from Entertainment Weekly. I would like to have a good show.
KRAMER Danke schoen, my little dumplings.
ELAINE Hi.
KRAMER Hey, how about that Toby, huh?
ELAINE Yeah, how about her?
KRAMER Ooh, she's a package full of energy!
ELAINE Yeah, she's a package full of something.
KRAMER And that something is life. Jerry, you gotta meet this gal - she's brimmin' with positivity!
ELAINE Oh, pleeeeease.
KRAMER Hey, are you performing tomorrow night?
JERRY Yeah.
KRAMER Great, I'm gonna bring Toby.
JERRY Well, you better laugh 'cause I'm being reviewed. Leonard Christian's gonna be there.
KRAMER Oh, she's a great laugher - right, Elaine?
ELAINE Oh yeah, she's a great laugher, Jerry. Really, really great!
JERRY Well, you want to sit with George? I think he's coming with Robin.
KRAMER Is that the waitress from the comedy club?
JERRY Yeah.
ELAINE What about her kid, is she bringing him, too?
KRAMER She's got a kid?
JERRY Yeah, you should see George get along with this kid!
GEORGE Ow! What are you doing under there? Hey, stop that! Don't eat that! That's not food! He's suckin' down Equal packets!
ROBIN Do you think 25 kids is too much?
GEORGE 25 kids for his birthday party? Don't put your tongue on the floor! He's putting his tongue on the floor! Here, here, have some more sugar packets.
ROBIN So, what about entertainment? Should I get Barney?
KID No Barney!
ROBIN Maybe a clown.
GEORGE How about Bozo?
KID Who's Bozo?
GEORGE Who's Bozo? Bozo the Clown, that's who Bozo is. When I was a kid, Bozo the Clown was the clown, bar none.
ROBIN George...
GEORGE With the orange hair, and the big clown shirt with the ruffles...
ROBIN George...
GEORGE And the TV show! He had cartoons!
ROBIN George! Forget Bozo, George. Bozo's out. He's finished. It's over for Bozo.
GEORGE You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have these elaborate birthday parties with catered food and entertainment. I remember my 7th birthday party...
FRANK Blow out the candles! Blow out the candles, I said! Blow out the damn candles!
ESTELLE Stop it, Frank! You're killing him!
ROBIN Well, this time, you can blow out the candles.
GEORGE Nah, I have asthma.
TOBY Hi!
ELAINE Hi, Toby.
TOBY How are you doing today?
ELAINE Fine... How are you?
TOBY Oh, I'm great! Just great. Really great! Oh, hey - did you hear about Bob Rosen?
ELAINE Nope.
TOBY He is going to Knopp. He is going to be a vice president.
ELAINE Knopp? Really? Boy. That means there's an opening here for senior editor...has Lippman, uh, hired anyone?
TOBY No. I hear he wants to promote someone in-house.
ELAINE Really!
TOBY Maybe it'll be you!
ELAINE Oh...well...
TOBY You really deserve it. I mean, you have experience, seniority...Lippman really respects your opinion...
ELAINE Well! Well, it could be you.
TOBY No...
ELAINE No, really.
TOBY Really? You think so?
ELAINE Sure.
TOBY Boy, wouldn't that be exciting!
ELAINE I mean, stranger things have happened...
TOBY Wow! Me! A senior editor! I'd like that.
ELAINE Well, you shouldn't get your hopes up, Toby.
TOBY Well, it's a possibility, like you said! Stranger things have happened! Thank you, Elaine. Thank you.
JERRY Hey, Ronnie. Can I have a club soda? Goin' on tonight?
RONNIE Yeah. You?
JERRY Yeah.
RONNIE You know Leonard Christian's here?
JERRY Yeah, I know.
RONNIE Can I ask you something? Are my nostrils getting bigger?
JERRY I don't...think so.
RONNIE Are you sure? Take a good look. They seem a little bigger?
JERRY I don't...I dunno.
RONNIE Is it possible for nostrils to expand?
JERRY Oh, is this a bit?
RONNIE Hey, I don't do "bits." I'm a prop comic. Dammit, I can't find my water gun. I can't go on without my water gun.
KRAMER Hey, Jerry. Toby, this is Jerry.
TOBY This is so exciting! Look, I have goosebumps! Touch! Touch them! I've never been to a comedy club before!
JERRY Really! You know, a lot of restaurants are serving brewed decaf now, too.
TOBY You are so funny!
JERRY Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear.
TOBY Oh! He swears like he thinks I don't believe him. I believe you. I believe you! Oh, he's so funny!
KRAMER What about me?
TOBY What about you? I'm only kidding. You're funny, too. I love to laugh.
JERRY Good, good.
KRAMER So, you up next?
JERRY Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats?
TOBY Oh yeah, we don't want some jerk sitting in front of us, it'll be like, 'Hey, big head, can you move out of the way? I didn't pay a cover charge to stare at your bald spot.'
KRAMER Alright, so you have a good show, huh buddy?
JERRY Yeah.
TOBY Oh, have a great show. Hey, we'll make sure it's a great show!
JERRY O.k., good, I'll see you later.
TOBY Oh, he's so great! This is so great! I'm so excited!
JERRY Men definitely hit the remote button more than women...
TOBY Oh, really! Really! That is so true!
JERRY Yes, yeah...see, men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV.
TOBY Yes! Yes! Right on! Right on!
JERRY See...women really want to see what the show is before they change the channel...
TOBY Oh, that is so true, yes!
JERRY ...that's why men hunt and women nest.
TOBY Boo! Boo! Hiss! Boo!
JERRY Hey, what's the deal? What was goin' on there? I invite you down here, I have an important show, and she heckles me?!
KRAMER Look, she didn't mean anything.
JERRY Well, what is the matter with her? Is she crazy?!
KRAMER She's just being enthusiastic, that's all!
JERRY Hey! What is wrong with you?!
TOBY Me? Nothing's wrong with me.
JERRY You boo me?! You hiss?! You didn't stop blathering throughout the whole set!
TOBY Oh, come on! I thought you're a pro! That's part of the show.
JERRY No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies!
TOBY Well, that's the way I express myself. How are you gonna make it in this business if you can't take it?
JERRY Oh, I can take it.
TOBY Let's go.
RONNIE Hey, man. Good set.
GEORGE Bozo?
ERIC No.
GEORGE b-o-z-o?
ERIC Sorry, I...
GEORGE You've never heard of Bozo the Clown?
ERIC No!
GEORGE How could you not know who Bozo the Clown is?
ERIC I don't know, I just don't.
GEORGE How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?
ERIC Hey, man - what are you hassling me for? This is just a gig, it's not my life. I don't know who Bozo is, what - is he a clown?
GEORGE Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!?
ERIC Well, what is he?
GEORGE Yes, he's a clown!
ERIC Alright, so what's the big deal! There's millions of clowns!
GEORGE Alright, just forget it.
ERIC Me forget it? You should forget it! You're livin' in the past, man! You're hung up on some clown from the sixties, man!
GEORGE Alright, very good, very good...go fold your little balloon animals, Eric. Eric! What kind of name is that for a clown, huh?
ROBIN'S_MOTHER Excuse me...you must be George! I'm Robin's mother. Oh, you seem like such a lovely young man!
GEORGE Well, I do what I can.
ROBIN Hi Mom, how's everything?
ROBIN'S_MOTHER Oh, this is just a wonderful party!
ROBIN The burgers should be ready in a minute.
GEORGE Ah, great, great. What's that smell? Smoke? Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here... Fire! Fire! Get out of the way!
GEORGE It was an inferno in there! An inferno!
ERIC There he is! That's him!
ROBIN'S_MOTHER That's the coward that left us to die!
GEORGE I...was trying to lead the way. We needed a leader! Someone to lead the way to safety.
ROBIN But you yelled "get out of my way"!
GEORGE Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards?
ROBIN But I saw you push the women and children out of the way in a mad panic! I saw you knock them down! And when you ran out, you left everyone behind!
GEORGE Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that exit was clear. Any other questions?
FIREMAN How do you live with yourself?
GEORGE Its not easy.
GEORGE So she doesn't want to see me anymore.
JERRY Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?
GEORGE No, her too. And her mother.
JERRY Really? Her mother.
GEORGE Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know.
JERRY You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.
GEORGE Yeah. But it was somebody's arm.
JERRY So you feel "women and children first," in this day and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion.
GEORGE To some degree.
JERRY So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves.
GEORGE In a manner of speaking.
JERRY Well, it's honest.
GEORGE Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like equals.
JERRY Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll see things differently.
GEORGE Perhaps.
JERRY So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers?
GEORGE Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe.
JERRY By the way, did you see this?
GEORGE What's that?
JERRY It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article.
GEORGE Wow, he really does a number on you. "Seinfeld froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling."
JERRY I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.
GEORGE You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and heckle her.
JERRY Yeah, right.
GEORGE You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'
JERRY Yeah, that'd be something.
GEORGE I'm not kidding, you should do it.
JERRY But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always had a fantasy about doing that.
GEORGE Well, go ahead! Do it!
JERRY Why can't I?
GEORGE No reason!
JERRY You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where I work, I'll go down to where she works!
GEORGE This is unprecedented!
JERRY There's no precedent, baby!
GEORGE What...are you using my babies now?
JERRY Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'
TOBY You know, I have work to do here! I'm very busy!
JERRY Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?
TOBY Well, how would you like it if I called security?
JERRY Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!
KRAMER Wait a second, what's happenin' here? Toby! Toby!
KRAMER What did you go up there to heckle her for?
JERRY Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste of her own medicine!
KRAMER Oh, YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine, alright.
JERRY Well, I didn't want her to have an accident.
GEORGE What accident?
KRAMER Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky toe.
GEORGE That's unbelievable!
KRAMER Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital.
GEORGE You ran?
KRAMER No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, "I got a toe here, buddy - step on it."
GEORGE Holy cow!
KRAMER Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well, I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the seat and I started walking towards him. He says, "Where do you think you're going, Cracker Jack?" I said, "Well, I got a little prize for ya, buddy - " - knocked him out cold!
GEORGE How could you do that?!
KRAMER Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and now I'm drivin' the bus.
GEORGE You're Batman.
KRAMER Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin' the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and I kicked him out the door with my foot, you know - at the next stop.
JERRY You kept makin' all the stops?
KRAMER Well, people kept ringin' the bell!
GEORGE Well, what about the toe? What happened to the toe?
KRAMER Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place at the end of the line.
GEORGE You did all this...for a pinky toe?
KRAMER Well, it's a valuable appendage.
JOANNE So, Kramer found the toe, and they re-attached it.
ELAINE Really.
JOANNE Poor kid. What an ordeal.
MICHAEL And you know how extremely sensitive she is...she's gonna need our full support.
ELAINE Yeah, right.
MICHAEL Toby, what can I do? Can I get you something?
TOBY Oh no, I'll be fine...
JERRY She got the promotion?
ELAINE Yep.
JERRY Why?
ELAINE I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings.
JERRY Too bad.
ELAINE Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to cut. What do we need it for?
JERRY Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the home.'
ELAINE Why don't you just shut the f-
KRAMER Hey Elaine, did you hear the good news? Toby got promoted!
ELAINE Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??
KRAMER Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon as possible.
ELAINE Oh, wonderful!
KRAMER You know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile on her face.
ELAINE Oh, of course! She's deranged.
JERRY So, I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to write another article.
RONNIE I heard you went down to somebody's office and heckled them?
JERRY Damn right! We've been lapdogs long enough!
RONNIE How could you do that? I mean, everybody's talking about it.
JERRY Well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand.
RONNIE Jerry, you're like Rosa Parks. You opened the door for all of us. I can't wait till the next time someone heckles me.
JERRY Yeah, well, won't be long.
ANNOUNCER Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Jerry Seinfeld!
JERRY Gotta go.
GEORGE Robin? Robin!
ROBIN George, what is it? I'm working.
GEORGE Robin, listen to me. The most amazing thing has happened. Kramer has opened my eyes. I think I've changed.
ROBIN What are you talking about?
GEORGE O.k....
JERRY I mean, Bozo the Clown...does he really need "the clown" in his title, as clown? Bozo, "the" clown? Are we going to confuse him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo...
GEORGE ...you'll see, things will be different now - if you just give me one more chance.
ROBIN Listen...I gotta think about this.
GEORGE Alright, but I'm serious about this.
RONNIE Alright, hand it over man!
JERRY ...that's why men hunt and women nest.
GEORGE He's got a gun! He's got a gun!
ROBIN George! This is Ronnie Kaye!
GEORGE The prop comic? Oh, hi...I didn't recognize you, what...did you get a haircut?
RONNIE Nostrils.
JERRY George - could I have a word?
JERRY I was in a hotel the other day, and on the back of the door in the hotel they have the fire map. I'm flattered that they think I have it together enough to stand in a burning hotel room memorizing directions. 'Yeah, I'll go left by the stairs, right by the candy machine...' I'd probably get lost, have to go back to the room, check the map again...and they always tell you, no matter what, whatever you do in a hotel fire - do not panic. Hey, I got four minutes to live, I've never panicked in my whole life - it's my option. Even if they find you, you have a perfect excuse...'Gee, I heard they saved you swingin' from the shower curtain naked with an ice bucket on your head. What happened there?' 'Well, I panicked.' 'That's understandable.'
JERRY Do you think that the people at the airport that run the stores have any idea what the prices are every place else in the world? Or do you think they just feel they have their own little country out there and they can charge anything they want? You're hungry? Tuna sandwich is nine dollars. You don't like it; go back to your own country. I think the whole airport airline complex is a huge scam just to sell the tuna sandwiches. I think that profit is what's supporting the whole air travel industry. I mean think about it; the terminals, the airplanes, it's all just a distraction so that you don't notice the beating that you're taking on the tuna.
GEORGE It's all departures. I see nothing but departures. Do you know where the arrivals are?
GEORGE Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?
MAN There's a clock over there.
GEORGE Where?
MAN There.
GEORGE But you have a watch on.
MAN It's right by the escalator.
GEORGE Why don't you just look at your watch?
MAN I told you, it's right over there.
GEORGE Let me see the watch.
MAN Hey! What are you, some kind of nut?!
GEORGE You know we're living in a society!
JERRY George.
GEORGE Jerry. Jerry.
JERRY Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've you been waiting?
GEORGE I just got here. My car broke down on the Belt Parkway.
JERRY Oh I can't believe-- why don't you get rid of that piece of junk.
GEORGE One mile from the exit it starts shaking, really violently shaking, like it's having a nervous breakdown. It completely stopped dead.
JERRY So you have no car?
GEORGE No.
JERRY So what good are you? Jerry looks over towards a chauffer holding a sign that says O'Brien
JERRY I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while, O'Brien's not showing up.
GEORGE How do you know?
JERRY He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him on the plane. He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square Garden.
GEORGE We should take his limo.
JERRY Yeah, right.
GEORGE Wait a second. Think about it. He's not showing up. Wait till you see the line of cabs, its like forty-five minutes long. You said he's in Chicago.
JERRY He's definitely in Chicago.
GEORGE Well the guy's just standing there.
JERRY How would we do it?
GEORGE We just go up to him, we say, "We're O'Brien."
JERRY Maybe he knows O'Brien?
GEORGE No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a sign. Let's just do it.
JERRY What if we get caught?
GEORGE What's gonna happen? They can't kill us.
JERRY Who's gonna be O'Brien?
GEORGE I'll be O'Brien.
JERRY Who am I?
GEORGE You're you.
JERRY Just me?
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY Okay.
GEORGE What, you don't want to be you?
JERRY Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?
GEORGE Like who?
JERRY Dylan Murphy.
JERRY What, now you wanna be Dylan Murphy?
GEORGE Well I like Dylan.
JERRY You could be Colin.
GEORGE Colin O'Brien.
JERRY I'm Dylan Murphy.
GEORGE I'm Colin O'Brien.
GEORGE Are we really doing this?
JERRY Come on
MAN Hey, do you have the time?
GEORGE Clock over there. O'Brien.
CHAUFFER Yes sir.
GEORGE Sorry we're late.
CHAUFFER Here let me take that for you.
GEORGE Oh thank you.
CHAUFFER I'll get the car and I'll bring it around front.
GEORGE Thank you very much. Dylan?
JERRY Colin?
GEORGE This is incredible! This is one of the greatest things I've ever done in my life! I'm gonna call my mother.
JERRY What for?
GEORGE I dunno, I'm in a limo. Hello ma? It's me. Guess where I am. In the back of a limo. No, nobody died. It's a long story, I can't tell you now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would you stop it? Alright, look, I'm getting off. No, I'm not telling you! How's this? I'm never telling you! I don't care! No! Fine! Never!!
JERRY She happy for you?
GEORGE Can he hear us?
JERRY No. Why?
GEORGE I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.
JERRY He can't hear us.
GEORGE Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick up your sister, have a little fun back here? No, he can't hear us.
JERRY Where's he dropping us? Maybe we can get him to drop us right at my house?
GEORGE We'll ask him. My dear fellow, where are you dropping us?
CHAUFFER Madison Square Garden, of course. I have the four passes.
GEORGE Of course, the uh, the four passes. Four passes to Madison Square Garden? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Of course! Chicago! The Knicks are playing the Bulls tonight!
JERRY What?
GEORGE We are going to the Knicks game! Michael Jordan!
JERRY We're going to the Knicks game!
GEORGE Did I tell you?! Did I tell you?!
JERRY I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!
GEORGE You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, wait, you see things as they are not and you s- Wait, uh, you see things, do you see things as they are? What do you say when you see things?
JERRY Lemme call Elaine and Kramer.
GEORGE If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'
JERRY Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square Garden. Can you go? Great, listen, call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner at seven o'clock. Alright. We're gonna pick you up in a limo. That's right babydoll. Hey listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien. I can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye. 'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first.
CHAUFFER I know.
JERRY_AND_GEORGE He knows?
GEORGE Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here?
JERRY Maybe it's a shortcut.
GEORGE We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic.
JERRY 'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit?
CHAUFFER Pick up the other members of your party.
GEORGE Right. The other members of our party. Other members of our party? What other members of our party? I didn't even know we were in a party. Oh, I'm telling you, the jig is up.
JERRY It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig.
GEORGE It was a good jig.
JERRY It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now? They're gonna know you're not O'Brien.
GEORGE There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.
JERRY First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.
GEORGE Well you should have been O'Brien.
JERRY I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?
GEORGE Yes, you have to be Murphy.
JERRY It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.
GEORGE You're Murphy!
JERRY I'm Seinfeld!
GEORGE You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car.
JERRY We're doing sixty miles an hour!
GEORGE So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt.
JERRY Who are you, Mannix?
GEORGE We're slowing down. Are those the people?
JERRY Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping.
WOMAN Mr. O'Brien?
JERRY No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping.
EVA Oh, well I don't want to disturb him. We're just rather excited to meet him face to face, finally. We're faithful readers of his newsletter.
JERRY Newsletter?
TIM And of course, his great book, "The Game".
JERRY Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've never uh, met him before?
EVA No.
JERRY Never seen a picture of him?
EVA Never.
JERRY Not even on the book jacket?
EVA There was no picture on the book jacket.
JERRY Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake up.
GEORGE Hello. I'm O'Brien.
KRAMER Hey!
ELAINE Hey!
KRAMER What, you took a cab?
ELAINE Yeah? So?
KRAMER How much do you make?
ELAINE I'm not telling you.
KRAMER C'mon.
ELAINE No!
KRAMER I'll tell you how much I make.
ELAINE I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, I don't even like basketball.
KRAMER You ever seen Michael Jordan?
ELAINE Just in those commercials.
KRAMER Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks.
ELAINE What's that?
KRAMER Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me.
ELAINE Huh?
KRAMER Yeah.
JERRY I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.
TIM You think someone's been tipped off?
GEORGE So, um, you've read "The Big Game", have you?
EVA Yes I've read it and I've memorized it.
GEORGE Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman thinks of "The Big Game".
EVA Well, this is sort of embarrassing, but it's changed my life. The way you analyzed the game? The way you identify the major players? Well it left me breathless. You're a brilliant, brilliant man.
GEORGE Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids.
TIM Just a game. He's so humble. Don't forget what you wrote in the epilogue, the fate of the world depends on the outcome of this game.
GEORGE Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.
JERRY He tends to exaggerate.
GEORGE Okay, I mean it's serious but--
EVA We are really looking forward to your speech tonight.
GEORGE Uh, my speech?
EVA Yes, your secretary faxed me the copy. Would you like to look it over?
JERRY Well you might as well look it over.
KRAMER So what's going on, how did all this happen?
ELAINE Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
KRAMER Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.
ELAINE He did.
KRAMER Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?
ELAINE I don't know.
KRAMER That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?
ELAINE Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them O'Brien and Murphy.
KRAMER O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?
GEORGE ...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white minority communities.
JERRY You're not going to open with that, are you?
EVA What was that you said about the myth of the Holocaust?
GEORGE I said so many things.
GEORGE They're shooting! They're shooting!
TIM Alright, get down!
EVA Ohhh. I'm ready to die for you.
GEORGE That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you.
EVA But of course you know I would. I would do anything for you. Anything.
TIM Nothing to worry about, it was just a flat tire. But rest assured, we're prepared to handle anything that might come up.
JERRY Nice looking Lugar.
JODI I'm standing in front of the Paramount adjacent to Madison Square Garden where a growing number of vociferous and angry demonstrators are gathering to protest the very first public appearance of Donald O'Brien, the leader of the midwestern regional chapter of the Aryan Union, and reputed to be their most charismatic spokesman. The reclusive Mr. O'Brien is an advocate of the violent overthrow of the government. He has openly professed a deep admiration of Adolf Hitler. Even David Duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist. There is a full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport. Sources tell me he is in route and should be arriving momentarily. Police have set up barricades, but quite frankly Bill and Jean, I don't think they're any match for the emotional fuse that has been lit here tonight. Reporting from the Paramount, I'm Jodi Baskerville, back to you in the studio.
KRAMER Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry. They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?
DAN Elaine?
ELAINE Dan! Oh, hi Dan, how are you?
DAN Good.
ELAINE Um, oh, this is um, Kramer.
DAN Oh, Kramer?
ELAINE What's going on?
DAN Oh, we're heading down to protest this big neo-nazi rally. The head of the Aryan Union is speaking, he's in from Chicago. You should come.
ELAINE Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
DAN Oh, well that's where the rally is. The Paramount, right next door.
ELAINE Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you.
DAN Yeah, yeah ok. It's really gonna be something, this is the first time he's ever appeared in public, no one even knows what he looks like.
KRAMER Who?
DAN The head of the Aryan Union: O'Brien.
JERRY What's taking him so long out there?
GEORGE Didja see the way she was looking at me?
JERRY She's a Nazi, George. A Nazi!
GEORGE I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though.
JERRY Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?
GEORGE I don't know.
JERRY Let's just make a run for it.
GEORGE I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.
JERRY How'd that happen?
GEORGE I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick it out and I pulled it.
JERRY I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your feet like that.
GEORGE For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police.
GEORGE 9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens--
GEORGE --Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! The Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will.
TIM We'll be ready in a minute.
GEORGE Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle of something.
TIM With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave.
GEORGE Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me?
TIM You are.
GEORGE And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular again?
TIM You are.
GEORGE Good. I think you forgot something.
TIM I'm sorry.
GEORGE Good. Now get out.
GEORGE Okay, what are we gonna do?
JERRY I don't know.
GEORGE Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, we see Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city.
JERRY Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.
KRAMER I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.
ELAINE I'm sure he was just joking around.
KRAMER Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago, Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. Yes!
ELAINE What is it?
KRAMER Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry, always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo? The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!
ELAINE Jerry's a nazi?!
KRAMER I can't believe I didn't see it.
ELAINE Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.
KRAMER You don't think so.
ELAINE No, he's just neat.
TIM You know it's funny. You don't look like an O'Brien.
GEORGE Me??
TIM And you really don't look like a Murphy.
JERRY I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.
GEORGE He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.
TIM Where are you from?
JERRY Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.
TIM Sounds more like Scottish.
JERRY We were right on the border.
KRAMER Maybe he's with the company.
ELAINE What?
KRAMER The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within.
ELAINE What about his comedy act?
KRAMER That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.
ELAINE What about George?
KRAMER What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're with the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who killed Kennedy!
ELAINE I'll bet they were even in on it.
KRAMER Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. I'm not gonna.
ELAINE Kramer, you're hurting me!
GEORGE Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk to them, pull over.
ELAINE Get off of me!!
KRAMER O'Brien.
MAN O'Brien? Is that him?
MAN_2 Yeah, that's him.
MAN_3 Look there's O'Brien!
MAN_4 Filthy nazi bastard!
ALL_FOUR Let's get him!!
GEORGE What do I do?! What do I do?!
JERRY Get in the car! Get in the car!
KRAMER O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?
TIM Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy?
JERRY No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.
ELAINE It could be very confusing.
KRAMER Yeah? Eva?
EVA It's for me. Hello? It's O'Brien.
KRAMER O'Brien? Well that's weird.
EVA Who are you?
JODI A limousine has just pulled up it's being surrounded by a huge group of protestors, this has the makings of a very ugly scene. Cut back to the limo, Elaine has joined the group explanation, none of the three are intelligible at this point.
JODI They are banging on the car, trying to flip it over. The police seem unable or unwilling to control the crowd, I would imagine Mr. O'Brien must be having some very grave doubts if he made the right choice for his first public appearance.
EVA Get out!!
ELAINE Look, it's Dan! Hi Dan!
DAN Elaine?
ELAINE Hey!
GEORGE I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone! Jerry?! Jerry?!!
JERRY So I was watching this movie the other night, it was a World War Two movie and there was Nazis in the movie and I noticed that the Nazis in those movies always had like two separate heils. They had like the regular heil that they would do and then when they were around the offices they had like this casual heil, remember that one, you ever notice that? They come in, yeah, heil, how are ya, is the kid back with the coffee yet? Come on, are you finished with the copier? Yeah. World domination, Aryan race, whose donuts are those? Yeah, heil, nice to see ya, can I have one of those donuts?
JERRY I have a friend, wears eyeglasses, no prescription in the glasses because he thinks it makes him look more intelligent, now why? Why do we think that glasses makes us look more intelligent? Is it from the endless hours of reading and studying and researching that this person supposedly blew out their eyeballs, and that's why they need the glasses? It's just a corrective device. If you see someone with a hearing aid, you don't think, 'Oh, they must have been listening real good...yeah, to a lot of important stuff...' No, they are deaf. They can't hear.
KRAMER Hey, boys and girls. I need you both to sponsor me in the AIDS walk.
ELAINE Is that tomorrow?
KRAMER Yeah, yeah, so...git-git...
ELAINE Well, I admire you for joining the fight against AIDS.
KRAMER Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't be able to live with myself.
JERRY It's hard enough living next door.
KRAMER I tell ya, there's some people, they just wear a ribbon and they think they're doin' something? Not me. I talk the talk, and I walk the walk, baby. I'll be right back.
ELAINE New jeans?
JERRY Yeah.
ELAINE Still a 31 waist?
JERRY Yep. Since college. Hey, Lena Small's on this list.
ELAINE Lena Small?
JERRY Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted...and now here's her number.
ELAINE Oh, you're not gonna cop a girl's phone number off an AIDS charity list!
JERRY Elaine, you should admire me...I'm aspiring to date a giving person.
ELAINE You're a taking person.
JERRY That's why I should date a giving person. If I date a taking person, everyone's taking, taking, taking, no one's giving - it's bedlam.
ELAINE She's gonna ask how you got her number.
JERRY Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to me.
ELAINE What's he look like?
JERRY I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying a speedboat.
ELAINE You're buying a speedboat?
JERRY See, we're already off the subject of how I got her number. All I gotta do is get past the first phone call and I'm home free.
ELAINE I don't know about that.
JERRY So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you wouldn't have gone out with him?
ELAINE Well...
JERRY Yeah. So you really like this guy.
ELAINE Very much.
JERRY How's the...sexual chemistry?
ELAINE Haven't been in the lab yet. But I am birth control shopping today.
KRAMER Are you still on the pill?
ELAINE Uh, Kramer...
KRAMER I'll tell ya, I think birth control should be discussed in an open forum.
ELAINE The sponge, o.k.? The Today sponge.
KRAMER But wasn't that taken off the market?
ELAINE Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves the sponge.
KRAMER I read it in Wall Street Week...Louis, uh, Rukeyser.
JERRY Hello, Lena? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. How did I get your number? I met a guy that knows you, he gave it to me...I don't remember his name. Think it began with a W, maybe a Q. I wasn't paying that much attention, I'd just come from shopping for a speedboat... George and Susan in George's car.
SUSAN You know, I really like those new jeans Jerry was wearing. He's really thin.
GEORGE Not as thin as you think.
SUSAN Why? He's a 31. I saw the tag on the back.
GEORGE The tag, huh?
SUSAN Mmm-hmm.
GEORGE Let me tell you something about that tag. It's no 31, and uh...let's just leave it at that.
SUSAN What are you talking about?
GEORGE He scratches off a 32 and he puts in 31.
SUSAN Oh, how could he be so vain?
GEORGE Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld that only I know. I can't believe I just told you that.
SUSAN Why not?
GEORGE Well, Jerry doesn't want anyone to know.
SUSAN Well, it's alright, I'm your fiance. Everyone assumes you'll tell me everything.
GEORGE Where did you get that from?
SUSAN Well, we're a couple. It's understood.
GEORGE I never heard of that.
SUSAN Well, you've never been a couple.
GEORGE I've coupled! I've coupled!
SUSAN Keeping secrets! This is just like your secret bank code.
GEORGE This is totally different! That was my secret, this is Jerry's secret! There's...there's attorney-client priveleges here! If I play it by your rule, no one'll ever confide in me again, I'll be cut out of the loop! George arrives at Jerry's apartment.
GEORGE Hey.
JERRY Hey. What's the matter?
GEORGE I had a fight with Susan.
JERRY What about?
GEORGE Oh... ...clothing, something, I dunno. So, uh, what are you doing today?
JERRY I got a date with that girl, Lena.
GEORGE Lena, how'd you meet her?
JERRY I actually met her a few weeks ago, but...
GEORGE You met her a few weeks ago, but...?
JERRY I didn't call her till today.
GEORGE So, uh...wanna double?
JERRY What?
GEORGE Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic.
JERRY I dunno. Hey.
ELAINE Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me the sponge is off the market.
JERRY So what are you gonna do?
ELAINE I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store in a 25-block radius.
GEORGE Just for these sponges?
ELAINE Hey man, women are really loyal to their birth control methods. What does Susan use?
GEORGE I dunno.
ELAINE You don't know?
GEORGE I, uh...figure it's something.
JERRY What are you all out of breath from?
KRAMER The elevator just broke. I had to walk up five flights.
JERRY And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, you're in horrible shape.
KRAMER Hey, I'm in tip-top shape. Better than you!
JERRY I got a 31 waist, mister!
KRAMER Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing?
JERRY What am I doing? I'm...dating a woman who happens to be sponsoring one of these walkers. a musical montage of Elaine's "hard-target search" - visiting stores and pharmacies all over town and not finding a sponge anywhere. She ends up at the Pasteur Pharmacy.
PHARMACIST Can I help you?
ELAINE Yeah, do you have any Today sponges? I know they're off the market, but...
PHARMACIST Actually, we have a case left.
ELAINE A case! A case of sponges? I mean, uh...a case. Huh. Uh...how many come in a case?
PHARMACIST Sixty.
ELAINE Sixty?! Uh...well, I'll take three.
PHARMACIST Three.
ELAINE Make it ten.
PHARMACIST Ten?
ELAINE Twenty sponges should be plenty.
PHARMACIST Did you say twenty?
ELAINE Yeah, twenty-five sponges is just fine.
PHARMACIST Right. So, you're set with twenty-five.
ELAINE Yeah. Just give me the whole case and I'll be on my way. Jerry and Lena having dinner in a restaurant with George and Susan.
JERRY Hey, I have found the best-smelling detergent. Lena, smell my shirt.
LENA Mmm! Very nice.
JERRY It's All-Tempa-Cheer.
LENA I use Planet. It's bio-degradable and doesn't pollute the oceans.
GEORGE Yeah, the oceans really are getting very sudsy.
LENA Can you wrap up all the left-overs on the table, please? I always take the left-overs. I work in a soup kitchen every morning at 6 a.m.
JERRY They serve soup at 6 a.m.?
LENA Yeah. That's all they have.
JERRY Do the bums ever complain? "Soup again?"
GEORGE I'd get tired of it.
JERRY How could you not?
LENA Guess who volunteered last week?
GEORGE Mick Jagger.
LENA No. Maya Angelou.
SUSAN Oh, the poet!
JERRY So, let me ask you something - these people eat soup three times a day?
LENA I don't know.
SUSAN So, did you get to talk to her?
LENA Talk to who?
JERRY Is it a lot of cream soups?
SUSAN Maya Angelou, the poet.
LENA No, I didn't get the chance.
GEORGE Oh, well, I'm sure you can reach her...she's a poet. What does a poet need an unlisted number for?
SUSAN I'm going to the ladies room.
LENA I'll go with you.
GEORGE What are you looking at me like that for?
JERRY Why'd you have to mention 'unlisted number'?
GEORGE What are you talking about?
JERRY Alright, I gotta tell you something, but you cannot tell Susan. George and Susan in the car on the way home.
SUSAN Jerry got her phone number off of an AIDS walk list? Oh, that's awful!
GEORGE I know, but don't say anything to anyone. He told me not to tell you.
SUSAN But you told me anyway?
GEORGE Well, you know, I was thinking about what you said before, and...you're right, I've never really been a couple, so...if that's the rule, then I'm gonna go by the rule.
SUSAN Thank you, honey.
GEORGE So, you wanna go home and...make up, officially?
SUSAN Can we stop by a drug store first?
GEORGE What for?
SUSAN I'm out of birth control stuff.
GEORGE Oh, o.k., yeah. Where am I gonna park here...?
SUSAN Oh, don't park. I'll just sit in the car, you can run in.
GEORGE Me run in? Why don't you run in?
SUSAN You don't know what I use for birth control, do you?
GEORGE Of course I do.
SUSAN You do? What?
GEORGE You know. You use the, uh...
SUSAN The what?
GEORGE You know, the uh...
SUSAN Just get me some sponges, please.
GEORGE Wait, wait a minute...they don't have them anymore. I just found out, they just took them off the market.
SUSAN Off the market? The sponge?
GEORGE Yeah, so you gotta use something else.
SUSAN I can't! I love the sponge! I need the sponge!
GEORGE O.k.... I think I know where we can get one. Jerry approaching his apartment door. He hears the sound of a loud group of people from inside Kramer's place. He knocks on Kramer's door. Kramer answers.
JERRY Kramer, what the hell is going on in there?
KRAMER It's a poker game... And I'm kickin' some serious butt!
JERRY Are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk tomorrow!
KRAMER Oh, you gotta be kiddin'! You see those two ladies I got showin'? Do they look scared?!
JERRY You're never gonna make it! Elaine and Billy in Elaine's apartment, kissing passionately on the sofa.
BILLY You, uh...you wanna go in the bedroom?
ELAINE O.k. Hold on just a second.
GEORGE Elaine? It's me, George. Hey, sorry to bother you so late. Hey! How ya doin.' Uh, did you get any of those sponges?
ELAINE Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why?
GEORGE Well...Susan.
ELAINE Ah, Susan uses the sponge.
GEORGE Susan loves the sponge.
ELAINE Yeah, I'm sorry, George. I can't help you out.
GEORGE What?
ELAINE I can't do it. No way, there's no how.
GEORGE Elaine...let me just explain something to you. See, this is not just a weekend routine...I'm on the verge of make-up sex here. You know about make-up sex?
ELAINE Oh yeah, I know all about make-up sex, and I'm really sorry.
GEORGE Elaine, can I just explain something to you very privately here? Susan and I have been together many, many times now, and just between you and me, there's really no big surprises here, so...make-up sex is all that I have left.
ELAINE I'm sure you'll have another fight, George. Hold that thought! Susan talking on the phone with Monica.
SUSAN So, listen to this. But don't tell anyone - Jerry Seinfeld? He got a woman's number off an AIDS walk list.
MONICA He got her number off an AIDS walk list?
LENA He what? Commercial break. Jerry and Lena in Jerry's apartment.
JERRY How'd you find out?
LENA A friend of a friend of a friend of Susan's.
JERRY George!
LENA Pardon?
JERRY Nothing. Listen, I'm sorry, I just -
LENA It's o.k.! There's nothing to be sorry about. I don't mind.
JERRY You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list?
LENA No, not at all. No problem.
KRAMER Ah, you're lucky you're walkin' out of here with a pair of pants on!
JERRY You went all night?
KRAMER Jerry, ah? Breakfast on me, huh?
JERRY Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, three hours! You're never gonna make it!
KRAMER AIDS walk! That's a cake walk. Hey!
JERRY So, George, guess what? Lena found out how I got her number.
GEORGE Really? How'd she do that?
JERRY A friend of a friend of Susan's.
GEORGE My Susan?
JERRY Why'd you tell her?!
GEORGE Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other everything!
JERRY Well you know what this means, don't you?
GEORGE What? //tinyurl.com/2b9c width=200
JERRY You're cut off, you're out of the loop!
GEORGE You're cutting me off? No, no, no Jerry, don't cut me off!
JERRY You leave me no choice! You're the media now as far as I'm concerned!
GEORGE C'mon Jerry, please! It won't happen again.
JERRY If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed someone?
GEORGE Hey, a "hit" is a totally different story.
JERRY I don't know, George.
GEORGE So, Lena was upset, huh?
JERRY You know what? That was the amazing thing.
GEORGE What, it didn't bother her?
JERRY No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about this girl.
GEORGE What?
JERRY She's too good.
GEORGE Too good...
JERRY I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that!
GEORGE I see what you mean.
JERRY I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with someone you admire.
GEORGE Where's the depravity?
JERRY No depravity! I mean, I look at her, I can't imagine she even has sex.
JERRY On the other hand...
ELAINE What?
GEORGE Thanks again for last night!
ELAINE Hey, I didn't even use one.
JERRY I thought you said it was imminent.
ELAINE Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really sponge-worthy.
JERRY Sponge-worthy?
ELAINE Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges.
JERRY But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?
ELAINE Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste any of 'em.
GEORGE You know, you're nuts with these sponges. George is gettin' frustrated! Kramer signing in at the AIDS walk.
KRAMER Uh, Cosmo Kramer?
ORGANIZER Uh...o.k., you're checked in. Here's your AIDS ribbon.
KRAMER Uh, no thanks.
ORGANIZER You don't want to wear an AIDS ribbon?
KRAMER No.
ORGANIZER But you have to wear an AIDS ribbon.
KRAMER I have to?
ORGANIZER Yes.
KRAMER See, that's why I don't want to.
ORGANIZER But everyone wears the ribbon. You must wear the ribbon!
KRAMER You know what you are? You're a ribbon bully.
ORGANIZER Hey you! Come back here! Come back here and put this on! George and Susan in a booth at the coffee shop.
GEORGE Elaine and her sponges...she's got like, a war chest full of them.
SUSAN Well, I don't see why you just can't use condoms.
GEORGE Oh, no, no...condoms are for single men. The day that we got engaged, I said goodbye to the condom forever.
SUSAN Just once...for the make-up sex.
GEORGE Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight, we're way past that.
SUSAN Come on, just once?
GEORGE No, no...I hate the condom.
SUSAN Why?
GEORGE I can never get the package open in time.
SUSAN Well, you just tear it open.
GEORGE It's not that easy. It's like "Beat The Clock," there's a lot of pressure there. Kramer in the AIDS walk.
WALKER_1 Hey, where's your ribbon?
KRAMER Oh, I don't wear the ribbon.
WALKER_2 Oh, you don't wear the ribbon? Aren't you against AIDS?
KRAMER Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just don't wear the ribbon.
WALKER_3 Who do you think you are?
WALKER_1 Put the ribbon on!
WALKER_2 Hey, Cedric! Bob! This guy won't wear a ribbon!
BOB Who? Who does not want to wear the ribbon? Elaine and Billy in her apartment.
ELAINE So, you think you're sponge-worthy?
BILLY Yes, I think I'm sponge-worthy. I think I'm very sponge-worthy.
ELAINE Run down your case for me again...?
BILLY Well, we've gone out several times, we obviously have a good rapport. I own a very profitable electronics distributing firm. I eat well. I exercise. Blood tests - immaculate. And if I can speak frankly, I'm actually quite good at it.
ELAINE You going to do something about your sideburns?
BILLY Yeah, I told you...I'm going to trim my sideburns.
ELAINE And the bathroom in your apartment?
BILLY Cleaned it this morning.
ELAINE The sink, the tub, everything got cleaned?
BILLY Everything, yeah. It's spotless.
ELAINE Alright, let's go. Jerry arrives at Lena's apartment.
JERRY Hi.
LENA Hi! Hey, look at this - I just got a citation in the mail for my work with shut-ins.
JERRY Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, they're a very eccentric group. Because they're shut in. Of course, they're not locked in, they're free to go at anytime.
LENA Oh, by the way, I checked at the soup kitchen - they do have cream soups.
JERRY Hey, that's dynamite. You know, Lena, I wanted to talk to you about something...you know, because you're such a good person -
LENA Oh, hang onto that thought - I'm rinsing a sweater, I left the water running. Hey, Jerry, can you get me a towel out of my bedroom closet?
JERRY Oh, o.k.
JERRY'S_BRAIN Oh my god! Look what's goin' on here! She is depraved! There you are.
LENA Thanks. So, you were saying...?
JERRY What? Nothing.
LENA No, you said I was a good person...
JERRY Oh...
LENA You seem like you want to tell me something.
JERRY Tell you something...I do.
LENA What is it, Jerry? You can tell me anything.
JERRY Oh, uh...you see these jeans I'm wearing?
LENA Yeah.
JERRY I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So, you know. That's it. George and Susan in bed. We see George's hands struggling to open a condom wrapper.
SUSAN Come on, George, just tear it open.
GEORGE I'm trying, dammit.
SUSAN Tear it.
GEORGE I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here. You gotta do it like a bag of chips.
SUSAN Here give it to me.
GEORGE Would you wait a second? Just wait?
SUSAN Give it to me. Come on. Come on!
GEORGE It's too late. Kramer surrounded by Cedric, Bob, and the other walkers.
BOB So! What's it going to be? Are you going to wear the ribbon?
KRAMER No! Never.
BOB But I am wearing the ribbon. He is wearing the ribbon. We are all wearing the ribbon! So why aren't you going to wear the ribbon!?
KRAMER This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to wear!
CEDRIC What are we gonna do with him?
BOB I guess we are just going to have to teach him to wear the ribbon! Jerry and George waiting for Kramer at the finish line.
JERRY It completely turned her off.
GEORGE Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares about your pants size?
JERRY I don't wanna be a 32.
GEORGE I'd kill to be a 32.
JERRY She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!
GEORGE That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers on those things so hard to open?
JERRY It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind.
GEORGE You never run out, do you? Where's Kramer? Everything's finished here.
JERRY Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my god...Kramer?
JERRY Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on.
GEORGE Hey, where's you AIDS ribbon? Elaine and Billy in bed the next morning.
ELAINE Good morning.
BILLY How'd you sleep?
ELAINE Great. You?
BILLY Fine, fine. Everything o.k.?
ELAINE Yep.
BILLY No regrets?
ELAINE Nope. What are you doing?
BILLY What do you mean?
ELAINE Oh...I don't think so.
BILLY Why not? I thought you said everything was fine.
ELAINE I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em.
ELAINE You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the speaker?
JERRY It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.
JERRY Oh look at this guy.
ELAINE What's goin' on?
JERRY Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in.
ELAINE Did you get a thank you wave?
JERRY No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy! Where's my thank you wave?
JERRY Give me that wave!
ELAINE Jerry, are you free on Friday?
JERRY Yeah, I'm free, why?
ELAINE Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have dinner with her and her husband.
JERRY Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into a parked car, and sped off, right on my block!
ELAINE You gotta follow that car!
JERRY What?!
ELAINE You can't let him get away with that!
JERRY Elaine, the guy could be dangerous.
ELAINE What are you, yellow?
JERRY I'm not yella.
ELAINE Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella.
JERRY Wait, he stopped, he's parking.
ELAINE What? What? I can't hear you. Jerry?
JERRY Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion steering.
JERRY So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.
GEORGE Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.
JERRY You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she left, she reached out and touched my arm.
JERRY He, he, he.
GEORGE I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why is that?
JERRY Let's not even analyze it.
GEORGE So you didn't turn her in?
JERRY I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.
GEORGE Gonna see her again?
JERRY Friday night.
JERRY Yep.
ELAINE It's me!
JERRY Come on up.
JERRY By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.
GEORGE Hey, hey, hey! I dig.
JERRY Oh, you dig?
GEORGE Yes! I see enormous potential here.
JERRY Why?
GEORGE Because great couples always have a great story about how they met. That's why I've never been in a long term relationship. I've never had a good meeting story.
JERRY I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.
GEORGE I don't think so.
JERRY Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like a criminal!
JERRY On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?!
JERRY What am I drinking, milk?
ELAINE Hey!
JERRY Hi.
ELAINE Sweater.
JERRY Thank you.
ELAINE So? What happened?
JERRY With that?
ELAINE With the car!
JERRY What car?
ELAINE The hit and run!
JERRY Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run. Well. Actually, the guy went into Queens.
ELAINE Queens?! You followed him over the bridge?
JERRY Over the bridge.
GEORGE Oh, well I didn't know you went into Queens Jerry.
JERRY Yeah, Queens.
ELAINE So? Then what?
JERRY So he gets out of the car, I say, "Hey buddy! I saw you hit that car!" So he says to me, "What are ya gonna do about it?"
JERRY So I said to him, "Whatever's necessary."
ELAINE I am speechless. I am without speech.
GEORGE Tell her about the shoving.
JERRY What?
ELAINE What shoving?!
JERRY Oh, it was nothing.
GEORGE No! Tell her.
JERRY Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the car. So I went into a karate stance.
ELAINE You know karate??
JERRY I know a little.
ELAINE Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did he do?
JERRY He backed off. Pretty pathetic actually.
KRAMER Hey!
ELAINE Did you tell Kramer?
JERRY Ah, nah!
KRAMER What? What? What? Tell me.
ELAINE Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him.
KRAMER Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that? You know those people, you know they're mentally disturbed.
KRAMER They should be sent to Australia.
JERRY Australia?
KRAMER Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts.
JERRY But not any more.
KRAMER No.
ELAINE Hey Kramer, Kramer!
KRAMER Yeah?
ELAINE What happened to you right here?
KRAMER I don't know!
KRAMER You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight, and uh, suddenly I got dizzy. And the next thing I know I hit my head on the coffee table.
ELAINE Well, that is, that is strange.
KRAMER Yep.
ELAINE Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?
JERRY Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date.
ELAINE But last night you said you were free!
JERRY We just met.
KRAMER Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines.
ELAINE But I, I can't go alone!
JERRY Ask George to go with you.
ELAINE George, come on! I'll pay for you.
GEORGE You'll pay? I'm there.
JERRY Why do you even need anybody?
ELAINE Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple. Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. They're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting.
ROBIN You went out with a bullfighter?
ELAINE Yes, well, an ex-bullfighter now.
MICHAEL Wow.
ROBIN What was his name?
ELAINE His name? Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio.
GEORGE Pass the salt please.
ROBIN Where did you meet him?
ELAINE Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull.
GEORGE Bread.
ELAINE I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really do learn about life.
GEORGE God bless you.
ROBIN Thank you.
GEORGE I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't going to open his mouth.
WOMAN You know who's a good actor? Anthony Quinn.
JERRY Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note.
WOMAN Did you ever see Zorba the Greek?
JERRY Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car.
WOMAN Come here.
GEORGE Really, I was, I was only kidding around.
ROBIN He was only joking Michael.
MICHAEL You think you're so damn special because you say 'God bless you'?
GEORGE No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not special.
ROBIN He was only joking Michael! Sorry.
MICHAEL All right! Take his side!
ROBIN I am not taking his side.
MICHAEL Well who's side are you taking?!
ROBIN Well I'm not taking your side!
JERRY Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note. He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize.
GEORGE I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong?
JERRY The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal.
ELAINE It's me.
JERRY Come on up.
GEORGE Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this: Once he passes on that option, that 'God bless you' is up for grabs.
JERRY No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series.
GEORGE Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed again later, and it was also a single.
JERRY What if she's having an off night?
ELAINE Hi! Jerry. Hi.
ELAINE Well! If it isn't mister gesuntheit!
GEORGE Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. I was raised to say 'God bless you'.
GEORGE Ah, shut up.
ELAINE What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid 'stuperstition'.
JERRY A stupid what?
ELAINE Whatever.
JERRY You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo good lookin''.
ELAINE Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left a message on my machine, she wants you to call her.
GEORGE Who?
ELAINE Robin!
GEORGE Why?!
ELAINE Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called me.
JERRY Entertainment Tonight's on.
GEORGE Where's the remote phone?
JERRY Bedroom.
ELAINE Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you?
JERRY What's it like out?
ELAINE Chilly out.
JERRY Can I take a sweater?
ELAINE Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to.
JERRY Scarf?
ELAINE Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off.
JERRY What's the matter? What's going on?
KRAMER What happened?!
ELAINE What?
KRAMER I think I hit my head again!
JERRY What is wrong?!
ELAINE Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer, the last time you hit your head, was Mary Hart on TV?
KRAMER Yeah.
ELAINE That is it!
KRAMER What?
ELAINE That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures. Just like, just like, just like that woman in Albany!
KRAMER Mary Hart!
GEORGE God.
ELAINE What?
GEORGE Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon.
JERRY Get together?
GEORGE Maybe she just wants to talk to me?
ELAINE Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.
GEORGE Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and martinis, and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldn't cost me any money.
ELAINE Are you actually considering this?
GEORGE I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable!
ELAINE Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note.
JERRY Yeah.
KRAMER Hey, you know who owns that car?
JERRY What car?
KRAMER The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.
JERRY Yeah who?
KRAMER That blond across the street. You know the one with the long ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants.
JERRY The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her.
ELAINE Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.
KRAMER Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?
JERRY The blond with the blue sweatpants!
GEORGE Well, who is she?
JERRY I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards.
GEORGE Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't say anything because of Angela.
JERRY Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow this to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!
GEORGE You can't compromise your principles!
JERRY How am I going to live with myself?!
GEORGE Can't live!
JERRY I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!
GEORGE This country needs more people like you!
JERRY Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick and Harry in great personal risk.
GEORGE I believe strongly in that as you know.
JERRY There should be more people like us.
GEORGE That's why the world's in the shape it's in.
JERRY You're telling me.
JERRY Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that.
BECKY Well God bless you.
JERRY Thank you very much.
GEORGE Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?
ROBIN Oh no, what's wrong?
GEORGE What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I just committed adultery!
ROBIN You didn't commit adultery, I did.
GEORGE Oh yeah.
ROBIN If I didn't do it with you, I would have done it with someone else.
GEORGE Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of losers out there.
ROBIN Maybe even someone who didn't say 'God bless you'.
GEORGE Well, that's a given.
ROBIN In three years with Michael, not one 'God bless you'.
GEORGE Must be hell living in that house.
MICHAEL Hi, it's Michael.
ELAINE Hi, Michael!
MICHAEL Is Robin there?
ELAINE Robin? No, why?
MICHAEL Uh, she said she was going to be with you.
ELAINE No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter of fact, um, she was here, and she uh, left a note, but I wasn't here, but I have the note, uh, right here.
MICHAEL If she's not with you, then where is she?
ELAINE Well I, I don't know.
MICHAEL Is she with your bald friend from the other night?!
ELAINE No, no, come on Michael!
MICHAEL He's finished! I'm going to sew his ass to his face! I'm going to twist his neck so hard his lips will be his eyebrows! I'm going to break his joints, and reattach them!
ELAINE You're soo good lookin'.
ANGELA Now you listen to me, suck face! You tell anybody, anything, and I will carve my initials in your brain tissue!
JERRY Let me rephra-
ANGELA I'll bash your skull into a vegematic like a bad cabbage, and I'll have a party on your head!
JERRY Hi Elaine, this is Angela.
ANGELA I'll pluck all your body hairs out with my teeth!
JERRY Well I think I get the gist of it.
ANGELA So you don't say anything to anybody about me hitting that car!
JERRY What car?
ANGELA Good. I'm glad we understand each other.
JERRY It's not complicated.
ELAINE Very nice meeting you!
ELAINE Come on up.
ELAINE Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening! When you confronted that guy, in Queens! Now, let's just see if I've got this scenario right.
JERRY Alright Elaine.
ELAINE No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 'French Connection', kind of thing. You know? Sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the city!
JERRY It was just a couple of blocks.
ELAINE Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest!
GEORGE Hey.
ELAINE Oh, did you check you machine?
GEORGE No, why, what's happening?
ELAINE Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was.
GEORGE Yeah, okay.
ELAINE And I said I hadn't seen her.
GEORGE What?!
ELAINE No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on, and I said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. And then, and then he did mention your name.
GEORGE He mentioned my name?! What did he say?!
ELAINE He said he was going to sew your ass to your face.
GEORGE What? Why couldn't you think of something?!
ELAINE Well I don't know, he caught me off guard!
GEORGE You lie! How hard is it to lie?!
JERRY It's not that hard.
ELAINE Well who told you to sleep with her George?!
GEORGE It's not my fault! I wasn't going to do anything until you got her all juiced up with your story about having the affair with the matador!
ELAINE Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldn't have said 'God bless you'!
GEORGE Oh don't-
JERRY Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? What matador?
GEORGE She told this couple she had an affair with a matador.
JERRY A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell, what was the young man's name?
ELAINE Uh, Eduardo, uh, Carochio.
JERRY Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just rolls of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Ray's Pizza!
JERRY Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage.
BECKY Well, I already got an estimate. It's $875.
JERRY $875?
BECKY That's right.
JERRY Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then this person can pay me back.
JERRY Um, who do I make it out to?
BECKY Becky Gelke. G-E-L-K-E.
JERRY So, what are you doing this weekend?
BECKY You have got some nerve! You smash up my car, you don't admit it, and now you want to ask me out on a date?
JERRY I didn't do it!
BECKY Yeah righ-
JERRY You are soo good lookin'.
BECKY Thank you.
GEORGE Jerry, let's go! You ready?
JERRY You sure you want to do this? I'm going to be on the road for three weeks!
GEORGE Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking me, I'm not staying in the city.
JERRY Alright!
GEORGE Come on let's get out of here.
KRAMER How could you?
JERRY What?!
KRAMER Man! I never thought you were capable of this!
JERRY What did I do?
KRAMER I just talked to Becky Gelke outside, she told me how you hit and ran.
JERRY i...
KRAMER I don't even want to look at you anymore! All these years of friendship and you're nothing but a felon. You're an embarrassment to the building.
JERRY I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else!
KRAMER Now you're not going to lie to me, are you?
JERRY No, never.
KRAMER Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because I've got a date with her.
JERRY You got a date with Becky Gelke?!
KRAMER Yeah, going out with her Saturday night.
GEORGE Jerry, can we get out of here?!
KRAMER As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even had an excuse to talk to her.
JERRY Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can.
JERRY So you're saying UNICEF is a scam?
KRAMER It's the perfect cover for a money laundering operation. No one can keep track of all those kids with the little orange boxes of change.
JERRY Oh! No it's Sally Weaver.
KRAMER Oh! Yeah your old college roommate huh?
JERRY No , It's Susan Ross's old college roommate; she moved to New York a few years ago . she's trying to become an actress.
KRAMER Hmmm, Dramatica comedia heh!
JERRY Untalented, She's always inviting me to see her in some bad play in tiny room without ventilation. It's really depressing.
KRAMER Euh.. We don't go to enough theater.
JERRY She should just give up.
JERRY Heeyyy!...
SALLY Hey there Mr. Too big to come to my shows. I just came back. Whooo.....I'm on my way to an audition... still waiting for that big break.
KRAMER Why don't you just give up?
JERRY Kramer!!!
KRAMER At least that's what Jerry says. Now face it. If it hasn't happen it's not gonna happen. All right, we go grab some bouffe . Join us?
JERRY So......Susan's dead.....
KRAMER I think she was happy someone finally said it.
JERRY Why'd you have to say anything to her?
KRAMER 'felt that the conversation was lagging.
JERRY Why can't you ever keep your big mouth shut?
KRAMER I come in here to get a pleasant meal and if we're not gonna have one I'll grab a bite to eat at your place.
ELAINE You know, maybe Kramer is right, some people should just give up . I have.
JERRY What did you wanna be?
ELAINE I don't remember , but it certainly wasn't this. Look at this cartoon in the New Yorker, I don't get this.
JERRY I don't either.
ELAINE And you're on the fringe of the humor business.
GEORGE Hey!
ELAINE Hey! George look at this.
GEORGE That's cute.
ELAINE You got it?
GEORGE No , never mind.
ELAINE Come on , We're two intelligent people here. We can figure this out. Now we got a dog and a cat in an office.
JERRY It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets working there.
ELAINE The cat is saying " I've enjoyed reading your E-mail".
GEORGE Maybe it's got something to do with that 42 in the corner .
ELAINE It's a page number.
GEORGE Well , I can't crack this one.
ELAINE Aahh! this has got to be a mistake.
GEORGE try shaking it... Well ,Janet should be here any minute.
JERRY You've been hiding her from us. you must really like her?
GEORGE Aah! the minute I saw this girl , we just clicked. She's got such a nice face. hummmm her eyes, her mouth, nose
ELAINE We know what a face consists of.
JANET I'm sorry I'm late.
GEORGE Jerry , Elaine, I give you.. Janet.
JANET Nice to meet you.
ELAINE Hi!
JANET Do we still have time to make the movie?
GEORGE Oh! euh.. Yeah We just can't go to the supermarket to get some candy.
ELAINE Jerry , She looks exactly like you.
JERRY She does not.
ELAINE Well maybe she doesn't, I don't care.
JERRY Hey! Kramer.
KRAMER hey! you got some messages.. Yeahumm.. .George, George, Elaine, George again, Elaine, Newman; but that was a crank call. and some Sally woman called said "Thanks a lot , she's quitting the business, you ruined her life.
JERRY What! You're the one who ruined her life.
KRAMER Well that's not how she remembers it.
JERRY Well , I got to talk her out of this.
KRAMER I thought you said she stinks
JERRY She does stink and she should quit. But I don't want it to be because of me. It should be the traditional route; years of rejections and failures till she's spit out the bottom of the porn industry.
JERRY Yeah...
GEORGE Hey! George and Janet.
KRAMER Aahh...Who's Janet?
JERRY George's girlfriend , Elaine thinks she looks like me but I think it's as you would say ,kookie talk.
KRAMER You know what woman I always thought you looked like; Leena Horne.
ALL Hey, Hey!
KRAMER And you must....look exactly like Jerry. You don't see this; you're like twins .. WOoooohhhhh!!! this is eerie.
GEORGE Kramer , what are you talking about...Janet doesn't look anything like Jerry
JANET well maybe we do look a little like each other.
GEORGE No..hummm , What do you know about what you look like.
KRAMER C'mon George relax . Just because they look alike doesn't mean you're secretly in love with Jerry.
GEORGE All right now we're going bye bye.
JANET We just got here George
GEORGE Well,,, it's getting dark.
KRAMER yeah, she's a nice girl, kinda quiet though.
JERRY What are you doing? Don't tell a woman she looks like a man and George doesn't want to hear his girlfriend looks like me and frankly neither do I
KRAMER Well how should I have "broached the subject"
JERRY You don't broach, you keep your mouth shut.
KRAMER Well sounds like someone's having a bad day.
JERRY Yeah! Because of you.
KRAMER Well, I think one of us should leave.
JERRY Sally ,you can't quit the business. This is all because of me.
SALLY Hehumm!!
JERRY You can't give up. You don't think people tell me I stink? When I'm on stage that's all I hear; You stink , You suck. We like magic.
SALLY Really?
JERRY Of course , I stink , you stink. It's show bizz. everybody stinks..
SALLY Yeah! You've been stinking since the Eighties.
JERRY All right , I think we've covered my act. Now you get out there and stink it up with everybody else.
SALLY Right! , Yesss!! Thank you I'm gonna do it.
JERRY now!!!!....
ELAINE Well I've asked every one at work and nobody gets this cartoon. I mean I don't understand why no one can explain it, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.
JERRY Oh! I think we're at the bottom.
ELAINE Hey! George , Janet looks very nice and she's quite a handsome woman.
GEORGE What does that mean?
JERRY Yeah. What does that mean?
GEORGE What do you mean by that?
ELAINE Enjoy. Jerry; Elaine huh?.. She's completely..
GEORGE Oh! I know....'Cos you don't think Janet?..
JERRY No....
GEORGE Why would I...
JERRY It's ludicrous..
GEORGE Yes.
JERRY For either one of us..
GEORGE No... Jerry; So...
GEORGE Exactly.
JERRY I'm not gay.
GEORGE ...neither am I.
BOTH Kramer, Kramer , get in here.
GEORGE Where's the crazy man , Come on up.
JERRY Come on in here.
GEORGE Haaaaaa!!!
JERRY What's happening? What, you doing , come and talk to us.
KRAMER I've made an important life decision.
JERRY Lets talk about that.
GEORGE Don't leave
KRAMER Aw right. I know I've been shooting off at the mouth lately; First with that girl whose life you destroyed and.. emm...about George dating a lady Jerry
GEORGE What's the decision?
KRAMER I know you want me to keep my big mouth shut and that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'm never gonna talk again.
JERRY Yeah right.
KRAMER What do I need to talk for.. ha! , For to blab to the neighbors about George has a new fem-Jerry friend or to tell everybody at the coffee shop ho George is all mixed up in a perverse sexual amalgam of some girl and his best friend. See now , I've done all that.....Now it's time for silence.
GEORGE Silence yes!!
JERRY Kramer you're never gonna be able to completely stop talking.
KRAMER Jerry, ninety four percent of communications is non-verbal. Here watch.
JERRY Well what does this mean?
KRAMER Well it's Frank and Estelle's reaction of hearing George's man love towards she-Jerry.
GEORGE Shut up, shut up, shut up
KRAMER That's the idea.
JERRY Kramer there's no way you stick to this.
KRAMER ..Weeeeeepp!!
JERRY Oh! you just startin' now?
KRAMER that's right......Aye oooh!! ...Right now. Ouch!!..........Now!!
MR._ELINOFF So, J. Peterman wants to hire some of our cartoonists to illustrate your catalog?
ELAINE Well we're hoping that if perhaps that the catalog is a little funnier ,people won't be so quick to return the clothes ha ha....For example.. I..I really do....Well I love this one
MR._ELINOFF Oh! yeah... That's a rather clever jab at inter office politics don't you think.
ELAINE Ahan, Ahan....yeah...Euh but, Why is it that the, that the animals enjoy reading the email?
MR._ELINOFF Well Miss Benes . Cartoons are like gossamer and one doesn't dissect gossamer. heh..hemm..
ELAINE Well you don't have to dissect if you can just tell me. Why this is suppose to be funny?
MR._ELINOFF Ha! It's merely a commentary on contemporary mores.
ELAINE But, what is the comment.
MR._ELINOFF It's a slice of life.
ELAINE No it isn't.
MR._ELINOFF Pun?
ELAINE I don,t think so.
MR._ELINOFF Vorshtein?
ELAINE That's not a word.....You have no idea what this means do you?
MR._ELINOFF No.
ELAINE Then why did you print it.
MR._ELINOFF I liked the kitty.
ELAINE You know what? you people should be ashamed of yourself, you know ya doodle a couple of bears at a cocktail party talking about the stock market. You think you're doing comedy.
MR._ELINOFF Actually that's not bad..
ELAINE Oh! really well you know..... I have others
JERRY Sally, I can't believe you're already doing a One-woman show?

ELAINE Well I bet I can get in once I mention I'm from ...The New Yorker.
JERRY The New Yorker?
ELAINE Yes , The New Yorker , I've met with their cartoon editor and I got him to admit that that cartoon made no sense
JERRY Wow! Good work, Nancy Drew
ELAINE Then we ended up going out to lunch and he had some great gossip about James Thurber.
JERRY Nodding off...
ELAINE ....And he said I could submit some of my own cartoons.
JERRY Wow! that's incredible......But you don't draw.
ELAINE I do to.
JERRY What , your sad little horsies , the house with the little curl of smoke , the sunflower with the smiley face. the transparent cube...
ELAINE It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane.
JERRY Where did you see that? Those are private!!!
SALLY Jerry , sorry I'm late. Channel Nine is doing a piece on my show. Isn't that great? Do you hate me?
JERRY No ,no I tought the show was terrific. I was just wondering if you have to keep saying Jerry Seinfeld is the devil.
SALLY Well...That is the title.
JERRY I know but I thought that maybe you could mention how I apologized then encouraged you to stick with it.
SALLY You know I workshopped that and.. SNOOZERS!!! he he he....but I'll tell you what I'll think... It's all a journey.
JERRY You got a little shmootz there
NEWMAN Excuse me Miss Weaver , OH! My god it is you! I.. I've seen your show six times..
JERRY What a surprise.
NEWMAN Aahh! You're great ,It's great , It's so great to see a show that's about something.
DRIVER Where to?
GEORGE My friends are idiots , she doesn't look like Jerry. She doesn't look like anybody. And so what if does look like Jerry ,what does that mean?. That I could have everything I have with Jerry but because it's a woman I could also have sex with her....And that somehow that would be exactly what I always wanted.....She doesn't even look like Jerry..
SALLY You know I really do look like your friend Jerry.
GEORGE I know....
TV_ANNOUNCER Thanks for watching Nine News. We leave you tonight with a scene from Sally Weavers One woman show.
SALLY Ok so I go to meet Jerry Seinfeld at this horrible coffee shop right? And he's like "Hey stop doing your show." and I'm like, Hello! It's a free country. So then he goes." Okay Shmootsie" and he starts pulling at my sweater right?. He's getting , you know, Hands Across America.
JERRY There really was shmootz on I didn't try to grab her
SALLY ...And this is what he looks like when he's eating...
JERRY Get Out of my House!!.
ELAINE Well boys, I did it. I had to stay up all night but I finally came up with a great New Yorker cartoon.
JERRY I'd stayed up all night I'd fixed myself up a little before I'd go out.
ELAINE That is not the point.
JERRY some mouthwash , a hat , something.
ELAINE Just read it!
JERRY Pretty good.
ELAINE Pretty good? Well uh! This is a gem . Kramer look it.........What? It's funny.
JERRY It's a pig at a complaint department.
ELAINE And he's saying " I wish I was taller" ha ha. See? that's his complaint.
JERRY I get it.
ELAINE Do you!!!.. because that's not a normal complaint.
JERRY How 'bout if it was something like " I can't find my receipt my place's a stye.
ELAINE Everything with you has to be so .. jokey.
JERRY I'm a comedian.
ELAINE I wish I was taller, that's, that's, that's nice. that's real.
JERRY Well I got a complaint. This cartoon stinks.
ELAINE I'll tell you who doesn't think it stinks , The New Yorker. that's right. They're publishing it in their next issue. Oh! you know what I just ran into Newman in the hall and he said you tried to grope Sally Weaver.
JERRY oh! that's it I'm gonna put an end to this.
ELAINE The pig says "my wife is a slut."
JERRY Now that's a complaint. ...Hello Sally , yeah this is Jerry ,I just wanted to leave you a message that I caught your little piece on TV and I'm getting a little tired of hearing how horrible I am and would appreciate it if you would leave me out of your act all together.
JERRY That's it I'm calling in the big guns.
SALLY To cease and desist on behalf of my client, Jerry Seinfeld. Signed ; Crybaby Jerry Seinfeld's Lawyer. Ok but I got two words for you Jerry Seinfeld......You
JERRY How could she say that on TV?.. And how did she get a cable special . I 've never gotten a cable special.....well that's it I'm not giving her any more material. We are incommunicado. ...Exactly.
ELAINE Check it out, from the new issue of the New Yorker...huh!...Funny isn't it? Look at it, the pig wants to be taller and what's this guy gonna say?.. he he...Nothin'..he he.
PETERMAN Elaine, I'm afraid I have incurred yet another flat tire.
ELAINE Can I fix that after lunch sir?
PETERMAN Oh! no right away , chop, chop........Oh! a new cartoon....."I wish I was taller I'd like to see that complaint get rectified.
ELAINE You see? You see? Smart people think this is funny and you want to know why? 'Cause I wrote it.
DUGAN You shouldn't make fun of pigs.
PETERMAN Flash of lightning Elaine I just realized why I like this cartoon so much.
ELAINE Oh! Do tell sir? Peterman It's a Ziggy!
ELAINE A Ziggy?
PETERMAN That irreverence , that wit I'd recognize it anywhere. Some charlatan has stolen a Ziggy and passed it off as his own. I can prove it. Quick Elaine , to my archives.
GEORGE You know , you know what's great about our relationship?...It's not about looks.
JANET It's not? George; No , Can't be...For instance I remember when we first met , we had a great conversation.
JANET I remember you said I was the prettiest girl at the party.
GEORGE ....But after that we really talked didn't we?
JANET Well ,you told me how familiar I looked and that you must have seen me somewhere before.
GEORGE Na....no ... This relationship he..he..has got to be about something and fast or I'm in very serious and weird trouble....hum What else happened?
JANET You asked for a piece of gum because you thought your breath smelled like hummus.
GEORGE Aw right yes! Gum! Good enough I'll take it.
JANET I like gum.
GEORGE I do too. you see that's what we're about . You don't remind me of anyone and we love gum.
JANET I have gum in my hair.
GEORGE I'm losin' it
SALLY Hey! Your Jerry's friend. You're Goofy , mind if I sit. My show is going really well. Have you seen it yet? you should. Everybody else have and you know what? I got recognized the other day, How weird is that. I know . At first I liked the attention but it's like Whoa!! take three steps back , Get a life, okay. but then there wouldn't be a Sally Weaver without the fans, know what I mean. But who am I? anyway. I mean there's Sally weaver the woman , Sally Weaver the artist , Sally Weaver the person...
KRAMER Now you gotta shut up!........I'm sorry, I..I haven't spoken in days.
SALLY Well , lay it on me string bean.
JANET Let me get this gum out of my hair and then I'll be ready for bed.
GEORGE Ok Look , the gum isn't cutting it for me. We need to be about something else...anything..please.
JANET George.
GEORGE Your hair?
JANET Well I had to cut the gum out and I had a little trouble getting it even. So why don't you get undressed
GEORGE George is in big trouble....
JERRY You ripped off a Ziggy?
ELAINE It must've seeped up my subconscious , Puddy has Ziggy bed sheets....D'you read the comics today?
JERRY I see that Ziggy's back at the complaint department.. "The New Yorker is stealing my ideas." ha ha ha See that's funny.....'cause it's real.
ELAINE Hey look it Sally's cable show's on
JERRY Hey! Kramer come on in. You've got to watch this , now she's got nothing.
SALLY Master of Evil Jerry Seinfeld has broke off all contacts with me.
JERRY That's right sister. Why don't you just give up?
ELAINE Why are you yelling at the TV?
SALLY ..Ok get this; I heard he makes his best friend date women that look just like him. Hello issues..
JERRY Elaine , have you been talking to her?
ELAINE Hey! I'm just a fan..ha ha...
SALLY Oh and speaking of issues . Guess who got a no-polish manicure and begged his neighbor not to tell anyone?
JERRY I thought you stopped talking??
KRAMER ...All right ..Starting now......
JERRY You broke up with her just because she cut her hair! how short?
GEORGE like that
JERRY You mean like..
GEORGE ..That.
JERRY So she..
GEORGE Yes..
JERRY And you don't...
GEORGE Nooo...
JERRY So...
GEORGE Exactly..
JERRY Hmmmm...
GEORGE We...must never ever speak of this again..
JERRY No , no...... Hey uh.. you want to see a movie?
GEORGE Actually I think I'm gonna take a few days off
JERRY I think that's for the best.
JERRY The idea behind the tuxedo is the woman's point of view that men are all the same, so we might as well dress them that way. That's why a wedding is like the joining together of a beautiful glowing bride, and some guy. The tuxedo is a wedding safety device created by women because they know that men are undependable. So in case the groom chickens out, everybody just takes one step over and she marries the next guy. That's why the wedding vow isn't 'do you take Bill Simpson', its 'do you take this man'.
JERRY leave a message and I'll call you back, thanks.
JOE_DIVOLA Jerry, Joe Divola. Pbt Pbt Pbt I have a hair on my tongue, I can't get it off, you know how much I hate that? Course you do, you put it there. I know what you said about me Seinfeld. I know you badmouthed me to the execs at NBC, put the kibosh on my deal. Now I'm gonna put the kibosh on you. You know I've kiboshed before, and I will kibosh again.
KRAMER So, what do you think?
JERRY About what?
KRAMER About the opera.
JERRY Nah, I don't wanna go.
KRAMER You gotta go.
JERRY I-I-I don't like the opera. What are they singing for? Who sings? You got something to say, say it!
KRAMER Jerry, you don't understand, that's the way they talk in Italy, they sing to one another. Kramer starts to sing in bad Italian.
JERRY All right, all right.
KRAMER That's the way it was, you know. You listen to the language, its got that sing songy quality. It's the language Jerry, the language
JERRY So why don't they talk like that now?
KRAMER Well its, uh, well its too hard to keep up, you know, they were tired.
KRAMER Better get that
JERRY Yeah?
ELAINE it's me!
JERRY Come on up.
KRAMER So, huh?
JERRY I don't know
KRAMER Oh come on Jerry, its opening night, black tie, Pagliacci! The great clown, the great sad tragic clown, like you.
JERRY Well it's very flattering. How did you get these tickets, I heard they're impossible to get.
KRAMER Oh, well I have many associates.
JERRY I don't know, opera, it's not my kind of thing.
KRAMER All right, you not gonna go I'm not gonna go, I'm gonna call the whole thing off.
JERRY No, wait a minute, wait a minute, that's not fair, what about George, Susan and Elaine, what do you need me for?
KRAMER You're the nucleus, the straw that stirs the drink. You're the Miana!
JERRY Well I guess if I'm the Miana I should go. All right, all right.
ELAINE Hi!

ELAINE Its killing you isn't it?
JERRY Yeah, so Joey's a great lover of the opera
ELAINE Listen, I got news for ya, its nice to be involved with somebody who's interested in something other than nick at night. Now he's got a grip on reality, he's happy, he's well adjusted.
JERRY Well I'm looking forward to meeting him.
ELAINE I've got to go
JERRY Where are you going, what's the rush?
ELAINE I'm going to surprise Joey, I've never been to his apartment so I'm just going to 'pop in'

KRAMER Ok Quiet! Quiet! Now let me think!
JERRY I'm gonna call the cops. That's what I'm doing, I'm calling the cops.

JERRY What do you mean they're not going to do anything, they're the cops, they gotta do something, he just put the kibosh on me, do you know what the kibosh means, its a kibosh!
KRAMER Yiddigtkk ka kibosh.
JERRY I mean it's a terrible mistake, I mean he thinks I ruined some deal of his at NBC, I don't know anything about any deal at NBC.
KRAMER Call him and tell him
JERRY That's what I'll do, I'll just call him and tell him, I'll tell him. That's all I'll do. He's a human being, I'll talk to him. He'll understand. Right?
KRAMER Right.... Don't mention my name
JERRY Oh, I got the machine.
KRAMER What's his message like?
JERRY Nice!
KRAMER Eh!
JERRY Hello Joe, listen this is Jerry Seinfeld, I really think there's been a huge colossal misunderstanding,
KRAMER Big! Big!
JERRY and I feel if we can just talk about this we can straighten the whole thing out, so listen, so call me back. Bye.
ELAINE Joey? Joey? She sees a wall covered in photos of her. Joe Divola enters and shuts the front door.
ELAINE Oh god, oh, its you! You scared me!
JOE_DIVOLA Good. Fear is our most primal emotion.
ELAINE You left your door open.
JOE_DIVOLA I know, I like to encourage intruders.
ELAINE What's all this?
JOE_DIVOLA Do you like it? My home is a shrine to you.
ELAINE Where did you get all these pictures?
JOE_DIVOLA I took them myself with a telephoto lens. Coming out of your office, your apartment, shopping, showering.
ELAINE Showering?
JOE_DIVOLA I developed them myself in my dark room. Would you like to see?
ELAINE In the dark room? Uh no, no thank you. Not right now. I'm a day person!... Are you all right?
JOE_DIVOLA Why

JOE_DIVOLA What are you doing here?
ELAINE Oh, nothing, I just stopped by to chat, you know, shoot the breeze.
JOE_DIVOLA Were you able to get those opera tickets to Pagliacci from that friend of yours? I'm really looking forward to it.
ELAINE Oh, no, he couldn't get them. We're not going.
JOE_DIVOLA Really?
ELAINE Oh, dammit, you know I just remembered I gotta go, I left something on, the gas, the lights, the water in the tub. Something is on somewhere so I'm just gonna get the uh..
JOE_DIVOLA You know the story of Pagliacci, Nedda?
ELAINE Uh.. I'm Elaine!
JOE_DIVOLA He's a clown whose wife is unfaithful to him.
ELAINE Oh.
JOE_DIVOLA Do you think I'm a clown, Nedda?
ELAINE Do I think you're a clown? No, not if it's bad to be a clown, if it's bad to be a clown then you are definitely not a clown. But if its good to be a clown then, you know, I would have to rethink the whole thing.
JOE_DIVOLA You've betrayed me with another, haven't you, Nedda? Who is he. I want you to tell me who he is. I want his name. Tell me his name.
ELAINE Oh, like any man would ever look at me, come on, I'm gonna... get out of here.
JOE_DIVOLA Pagliacci kills his wife.
ELAINE Se, now that's terrible, that is not a nice thing to do at all, I don't know how this Paliachi thing turns out but you know I would assume that there is big big trouble for that clown
JOE_DIVOLA You're not leaving
JERRY But officer, he threatened me! I don't understand, that's not right! What if it was the President of the United States I bet you'd investigate. So what's the difference, I'm a comedian of the United States, and I'll tell you I'm under just as much pressure. Alright, thanks anyway, ok bye.
JERRY Who is it?
GEORGE It's George.
GEORGE What, are you locking the door now?
JERRY Well, well, look at you. It's a little skimpy there isn't it?
GEORGE Do you know the last time I wore this thing? Six years ago, when I made that toast at Bobby Leighton's wedding.
JERRY Ooo, that was a bad toast.
GEORGE It wasn't that bad.
JERRY I never heard anybody curse in a toast.
GEORGE I was trying to loosen 'em up a little bit.
JERRY There were old people there, all the relatives. You were like a Red Fox record. I mean, at the end of the toast nobody even drank. They were just standing there, they were just frozen! That might have been one of the worst all time toasts.
GEORGE Alright, still her father didn't have to throw me out like that, he could have just asked me to leave. The guy had me in a headlock! Susan's not going tonight you know.
JERRY What do you mean not going? why not?
GEORGE I don't know, she said she had to pick up a friend of hers at the airport. It cost me a hundred dollars this ticket.
JERRY Why doesn't she pay for hers?
GEORGE That's a very good question. You know she and I go out for dinner, she doesn't even reach for the check. That's all I'm asking for is a reach. Is that so much to ask for?
JERRY It's nice to get a reach.
JERRY Who is it?
KRAMER It's me!
KRAMER What, are you locking the door now?
JERRY Because of Divola! Get in here... How come you're not dressed?
KRAMER I am dressed.
JERRY You're going like this?
KRAMER Yeah. Hey I want you to hear something.
JERRY I thought you said people dress up when they go to the opera!
KRAMER People do, I don't.
JERRY Well what about me! If you're going like that, I'm not going like this.
GEORGE Wait a minute, wait a minute, do you think I'm comfortable here. I can't change, I've got no clothes here! You've got to go like that, I can't go like this alone!
JERRY Why should I be uncomfortable just because my apartment is closer to town hall than yours?
GEORGE That's not the issue, we're friends, if I've got to be uncomfortable, you've got to be uncomfortable too!
JERRY All right, all right, I'll wear this. It's bad enough I've got to go to the opera I've got to sit next to ozzie nelson over here.
JERRY Would you turn that down! What is that crap!
KRAMER It's Pagliacci!
JERRY Oh beautiful. Listen, we've got a little problem here, we've got two extra tickets.
KRAMER Why? What happened?
JERRY Well Susan isn't going and Elaine just left me a message her friend isn't going either.
KRAMER That's fantastic! We'll scalp the tickets, we'll make maybe five hundred a ticket.
GEORGE What? Really?
KRAMER Yeah.
GEORGE People are looking for tickets here?
KRAMER What, are you kidding? Opening night Pavarotti and Pagliacci. Ha, we're gonna clean up!
GEORGE Oh man! I knew I was gonna love the opera.
JERRY Oh yeah right.
KRAMER Ok come on, let's go get the tickets.
GEORGE All right, all right.
JERRY All right, you guys listen, I've got to wait here for Elaine, I'll meet you in front of the theatre.
GEORGE Oh, wait, isn't scalping illegal?
KRAMER Oh yeah!
JERRY You sprayed him in the eyes with Binaca?
ELAINE Cherry Binaca, it's new.
JERRY See, I don't get that. First they come out with the regular, then a year later they come out with the cherry. They know that we like the cherry, start with cherry! Then come out with the regular!
ELAINE It's like I didn't even know him. He's like a totally different person.
JERRY Well you should hear the message from my nut. Where's George and Kramer, I want to get inside already, I don't like standing out here, I feel very vulnerable.
JERRY Hey, hey, what are you doing, that's my quarter.
MAN_1 No it's not, it's mine.
JERRY I was just flipping it, it's mine.
MAN_1 No, I dropped it, it's mine.
JERRY All right, do you want the quarter, take the quarter, but don't try and tell me it's yours.
MAN_1 Well it is mine.
JERRY What, do you think I care about the money? Is that what you think? You want me to show you what I care about money? Here look, here look at this, here's a dollar here look, there, that's how much I care about money.
MAN_1 You think I care about money, that's how much I care about money, I don't care about money.
JERRY Oh yeah, well why don't you Just get lost.
MAN_1 Why don't you get lost.
JERRY Because I was standing here, that's why.
MAN_1 Oh Yeah?
JERRY Yeah! =
JERRY I kinda like this opera crowd, I feel tough... Anybody else got a problem?
PARK_GUY_1 Hey clown!
PARK_GUY_2 hey clown!
PARK_GUY_1 Make us laugh, clown!
PARK_GUY_2 Nice face, clown!
PARK_GUY_2 Make me laugh, clown!
KRAMER I got two, I got two huh, Paliachi, who needs two, Pagliacci, come on, the great tragic clown, come on, check it out, he laughs, he cries, he sings, Pagliacci. Hey, I got two beauties right here, check it out all right.

KRAMER Orchestra, Row G, dead center, primo! You'll think you died and went to heaven.
MAN_2 What do you want for them.
KRAMER All right, I'll tell you what I'll do. Cause you look like a nice guy, a thousand dollars for the duce.
MAN_2 I'll give you five hundred for the pair.
GEORGE Ok, it's a deal!
KRAMER Pzzzt. No.
GEORGE No? Are you crazy?
KRAMER Look, let me handle this.
GEORGE Five hundred dollars, that's a great deal!
KRAMER You're blowing this, the guys a pigeon.
GEORGE Did you see that? The guy's walking away. What is wrong with you? That was a three hundred dollar profit.
KRAMER Look, I know what I'm doing here George.
GEORGE This is not a Metallica concert, it's an opera alright, a little dignity, a little class, just give me my ticket, I will stand over here and sell it.
KRAMER Oh, yeah.
GEORGE Thank you very much. You just stand over there, I'll stand over here.
KRAMER I know where I'm standing.
GEORGE Alright.
KRAMER Hey!
GEORGE Get your Paliachi!
JERRY Where are they already?
ELAINE I guarantee they don't sell either one of those tickets.
JERRY Hey, look, there's Bobby Eighteen's father-in-law, Mr Reichman. George and I were just talking about that today, I can't believe it! That's the guy who threw George out of the wedding.
ELAINE Oh, yeah, when George made that bad toast!
JERRY Do you remember the curse toast?
ELAINE Oh yeah, the curse toast.
JERRY So, can you believe that message? Now I've got to spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
ELAINE Me too
JERRY Crazy Joe Divola
ELAINE How do you know his name?
JERRY What do you mean? Why wouldn't I know his name?
ELAINE I never told you his name.
JERRY I never told you his name.
ELAINE Wait a second, who are we talking about here?
JERRY Joe Divola.
ELAINE Right, Joe Divola
JERRY How do you know his name?
ELAINE I've been out with him three times, I should know the mans name.
JERRY Oh my god, its Joe Divola
ELAINE Is he stalking you? are you kidding me?
JERRY That madman is trying to kill me.
ELAINE Oh, Jerry, why didn't you tell me his name! Oh my god, he accused me of seeing someone else, he said tell me his name, he said tell me his name!!
JERRY Oh! He said that! Can you imagine what he'll do if he sees me with you! He'll think I'm the one who ruined his deal at NBC and took away his girl, he'll put a kibosh on me!
ELAINE Oooohh, what about me!
JOE_DIVOLA Excuse me
ELAINE_AND_JERRY Aaahhhhh!!
GEORGE But this is Pavarotti!
MAN_3 Three hundred dollars, that's a lot of money.
MR_REICHMAN You know Steven Holstman did a production at Tunis last yeas and from what I understand, the Moslems really took to it.
GEORGE All right, I'll tell you what, you seem like a nice guy, let's stop jerking around. Give me.. two hundred and fifty dollars, I've got people waiting for me, I've got to get the hell out of here.
MR_REICHMAN Scalping! I told them to put out extra security.. Excuse me.
GEORGE Hey pop, would you buzz off, I've got something cooking.
MR_REICHMAN Costanza!?
GEORGE Mr Reichman?
MR_REICHMAN You've still got a mouth like a surd give me those tickets.
MRS_REICHMAN Harold, no, Harold, Harold be careful of you're hair transplant!
JOE_DIVOLA Anything is welcome, I accept change.
JERRY I don't have anything, I gave it to that guy.
JOE_DIVOLA You know, you could just say no, you don't have to humiliate me. I may be dressed as a clown but I am a person.
JERRY I'm telling you, the guy took.....
JOE_DIVOLA And I don't need people like you looking down their noses at me. I am just a street performer out here trying to make enough to get by.
MRS_REICHMAN Doctor! Doctor! Is there a doctor anywhere!
JOE_DIVOLA What, are you showing off to your girlfriend here, is that it?
ELAINE I'm not his girlfriend. We dated for a while, but things didn't really work out.
JOE_DIVOLA You people make me sick.
JERRY That is one angry clown!
JERRY The hardest part about being a clown, it seems to me, would be that you're constantly referred to as a clown. "Who was that clown?", "I'm not working with that clown, did you hire that clown?", "The guy's a clown!". How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that you want to be a clown, I guess you get to a point where you're pants look so bad, it's actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done. Because if you think about it, a clown, if there isn't a circus around them, is really just a very annoying person. You're in the back seat of this guys Volkswagen, "What, you're picking somebody else up? Oh man!"
JERRY Camera, curtains, lights - This is it, we'll hit the heights - Oh what heights we'll hit - On with the show this is it!
ELAINE You know, it is so sad, all your knowledge of high culture comes from bugs bunny cartoons.
JERRY Oh there's that clown again, what does he want from me. Look I'm serious, I'm not kidding, I don't have the quarter, that guy took it.
JOE_DIVOLA I don't want any money.
ELAINE I smell cherry.
JOE_DIVOLA It's Binaca.
JERRY Binaca?
GEORGE What did we say? Two seventy-five?
MAN_3 Two fifty.
GEORGE Two fifty? Are you sure
MAN_3 Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
GEORGE All right, all right, two fifty.
SUSAN George!
GEORGE S-Susan
SUSAN I can't believe it, I'm so glad I caught you.
GEORGE What are you doing here, I though you were going to the airport.
SUSAN Oh, there was some problem with the plane, they landed in Philadelphia.
GEORGE So what, they don't have another plane? She couldn't take a bus?
SUSAN She's coming in tomorrow. I made it!
GEORGE Yeah you made it, how about that.
SUSAN Oh, I'm so excited, now we get to see the opera together.
GEORGE We get to go to the opera together!
SUSAN Who's that?
GEORGE That's-that's-Harry Fong, he's a very good friend of mine and he's a big opera buff. Enjoy the show there harry!... You know what.
JERRY Come on, you gotta let us in
USHER Not without tickets.
JERRY We have tickets, we just don't have 'em with us.
USHER Well that's a problem. Excuse me.
JERRY You don't understand, someone's after us, a crazy clown is trying to kill us.
USHER A crazy clown is after you? Oh that's rich. Now clear the entrance so people with tickets can get through.
JERRY_AND_ELAINE We're with him, we're with him.
KRAMER Are you guys ready?
JERRY_AND_ELAINE Yeah, Yeah!!
KRAMER Have you seen George?
JERRY We thought he was with you.
ELAINE Come on, he's on his own, come on!
KRAMER These are great seats huh?
ELAINE Yeah
KRAMER Yeah
JERRY Boy, some cast, huh? Pavarotti, Aver Martone.
ELAINE Aver Martone. I've heard of her, who's she playing?
JERRY She's playing, Pagliacci's wife, Nedda.
ELAINE Nedda?
JERRY Yeah.
ELAINE Oh my god..
MAN_3 Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.
JERRY Susan! What are you doing here?
SUSAN My Friend's flight couldn't make it.
JERRY Where's George?
MAN_3 I got his ticket.
SUSAN He decided not to come. He said he was uncomfortable.
JERRY Uncomfortable? How does you think I feel?.. Hey let me ask you something, how much did you pay for that ticket?
MAN_3 One seventy-five.
JERRY Kramer, who'd you sell your ticket to?
KRAMER Some nut in a clown suit!
JERRY I had some friends drag me to an opera recently, you know how they've got those little opera glasses, you know, do you really need binoculars, I mean how big do these people have to get before you can spot 'em. These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty, three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the women have like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. If you can't pick these people out, forget opera, think about optometry, maybe that's more you're thing.
JERRY I think gum is, is one of the weirdest human inventions. It's not a liquid, 's not a solid, 's not a food. What is it? It isn't really anything, you know. I mean, it's like a stationary bike for your jaw. Like, remember when you were in school, and teachers would get all riled up if they caught you with gum? And when you were a kid, you'd think 'What is the big deal?' But, as an adult, I can understand it, because when you're chewing gum, you don't look like you're too thrilled with anything anyone has to say. 'Oh, World War Two. That was an important historical event? Yeah, I'm sure.' 'They landed a man on the moon, nineteen sixty-nine? Yeah, right. Yeah, I buy that, teach.'
GEORGE You think she's happy?
JERRY Who?
GEORGE The cashier.
JERRY Ruthie Cohen?
GEORGE You know her name?
JERRY Sure.
GEORGE I don't think I've ever spoken to her.
JERRY Maybe that's why she's happy.
KRAMER Good morning, gentlemen.
JERRY What is this?
KRAMER Yeah, well, it's the latest offering from the Alex
JERRY That stinky old movie-house?
KRAMER Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up the place.
GEORGE With Spartacus?
KRAMER Well, it's a rare archival print. Twelve extra minutes, full wide-screen CinemaScope, and if you come to the one o'clock show, you can hear Geoffrey Har-harwood.
JERRY Geoffrey who?
KRAMER Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus. Some fascinating insights into the production.
GEORGE Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch on TV?
KRAMER Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something in the microwave? Why go to the park and fly a kite, when you can just pop a pill? Listen, you guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun, have you? I'm supposed to meet him here.
GEORGE Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for?
KRAMER Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office, to uh, get the theatre landmark status.
JERRY I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign.
KRAMER Well, he did. You know, after that, he had a nervous breakdown? Had to spend a few months in an institution.
GEORGE Really?
KRAMER Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my wing.
JERRY Oh, then I'm not worried. Lloyd Braun enters in the background.
KRAMER But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here treat him like he's one of the gang, huh. Lloyd wanders toward the guys at the table.
GEORGE Breakdown, huh?
LLOYD Hey Kramer.
KRAMER Oh, hey Lloyd, hey buddy.
LLOYD How you doing?
KRAMER Sit down.
LLOYD Hi Jerry.
JERRY Lloyd.
LLOYD George. Lloyd sits beside George.
GEORGE Hello, Lloyd. How you doing?
KRAMER Yeah well, he's doing fine, George.
LLOYD Gum?
JERRY That's an interesting package.
LLOYD Yeah, it's from China. Go ahead, try a piece. Tell me that's not the most delicious gum you've ever tasted.
KRAMER Yes, yes. We shall all try a piece and tell you how delicious it is.
LLOYD George?
GEORGE I don't chew gum.
JERRY Mmm, different. Where'd you get it?
LLOYD Friend of mine in Chinatown gave it to me. If you want I can ask him where he got it.
JERRY Nah, don't bother.
LLOYD No, it's no problem.
JERRY I don't want it.
KRAMER Jerry, Jerry. Lloyd says it's no problem. He's capable of locating the gum.
JERRY Alright.
KRAMER Mmm, delicious. This is delicious. Mmm. George sits at the table examining the contents of his wallet. Jerry is still chewing and by his face, he's not enjoying it.
GEORGE You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change. Didn't I pay with a twenty? I'm sure I paid with a twenty. Elaine enters.
ELAINE Hey.
GEORGE Hey.
JERRY I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. It's a little lo-mein-y
ELAINE What kind is that?
JERRY It's Chinese gum, Lloyd Braun gave me.
ELAINE Lloyd Braun? How's he doing?
GEORGE After Dinkins lost the election, he had a complete nervous breakdown. They had to lock him up.
ELAINE You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. Y... you don't think that I had anything to do with his breakdown, do you?
JERRY You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently for months.
ELAINE Yeah? Well, I got news for you.
GEORGE The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my mother was 'Why can't you be more like that Lloyd Braun?'
JERRY And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you. George snaps his fingers and points to Jerry, signaling his agreement. Then he picks up his jacket and heads for the door.
GEORGE Right, gotta get going.
JERRY Aren't you coming with us to Spartacus?
GEORGE Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents.
JERRY I thought your parents were outta town?
GEORGE Why d'you think I'm going now? Queens George has parked his car on the street, and gets out. An elderly guy is on the porch of his house and recognises George.
POP Georgie!
GEORGE Hey, Mr Lazzari.
POP Back in the old neighborhood, ah?
GEORGE Yeah, yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks.
POP Oh, snazzy car. Le Baron?
GEORGE Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight.
POP The actor, right?
GEORGE Something like that.
POP Mind if I look under the hood?
GEORGE Oh, no no no no. Go ahead, Pop, you always knew your cars. A young woman has exited from the old guy's house, and approaches.
POP Oh, Deena! Deena, Deena, l... look who's here. Pop lifts the hood of the car, and leans into the engine compartment.
DEENA George Costanza, is that you?
GEORGE Hey Deena, come on, give us a hug. Oh my gosh, you look as pretty as you did back in high school.
DEENA Boy, those were some crazy times.
GEORGE Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun? Lobby Kramer is leading Jerry and Elaine on a tour of the Alex. There are a few customers scattered about and a bored attendant behind the counter. Elaine has a big bucket of popcorn.
KRAMER The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two, during the golden era of movie palaces. Minor restorations in nineteen forty-one, forty-seven, fifty-two, fifty-eight, sixty-three, and currently to our present period of time.
ELAINE Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?
KRAMER Yes, yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark status from the City. We're hoping Lloyd Braun can pull a few strings.
JERRY Oh, can Lloyd really do that?
KRAMER Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry. And you should say hello to him, Elaine.
ELAINE What? Lloyd is here? Kramer indicates Lloyd approaching.
ELAINE What? No, no, I'd rather...
LLOYD Hi Elaine.
ELAINE Lloyd, yes. Hello.
LLOYD Kramer tell you? We reserved some special seats, so we can all sit together.
ELAINE Oh, well... I, uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have to sit in the front row, uhm, because uh, because, because he, he forgot his glasses. So uh, thanks for getting us... uhm, we'll see you afterwards. Elaine grabs Jerry by the arm and leads him toward the auditorium.
LLOYD That was odd. Am I crazy, or does Jerry not wear glasses?
KRAMER You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just forgot 'em, that's all. Not crazy. Auditorium Jerry and Elaine sit in the front row of seats. Elaine is eating popcorn.
JERRY We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the special seats?
ELAINE I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again. Seeing him made me feel very uncomfortable. The lights go down, and music is heard as the show begins. Jerry and Elaine lean back in their seats to be able to see the screen
JERRY Nah, you don't wanna be uncomfortable. Queens Deena and George are still talking. Pop is under the hood of George's car. Bangs and clanks can be heard as he fiddles with the mechanics.
DEENA Poor Lloyd.
GEORGE I know. Completely bonkers!
DEENA Sorry I can't be so flip about this kind of thing. You know, after what happened to Pop.
GEORGE Pop? What happened to Pop?
DEENA I thought you heard. He had a nervous breakdown last year. That's why I'm taking care of him. Pop comes out momentarily.
POP Oh, I tell you, they don't build 'em like this any more. He goes back under the hood.
GEORGE He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more?
DEENA Uhn, it was too much for him. Pop is thumping away at part of the engine with a spanner.
GEORGE Uhm, I, I gotta go.
DEENA What?
GEORGE I just remembered, I gotta be someplace. Yuh-hu-hur, that's enough. Pop. Pop, put down the wrench, Pop. Auditorium Kramer and Lloyd sits side by side in the special seats, watching Spartacus. They're smiling happily. Jerry and Elaine lean uncomfortably back in their front-row seats. They're both eating popcorn. Elaine drops a piece onto her blouse, where it rests next to a fancy button. She retrieves the corn, and dislodges the button without noticing. The button falls to the floor where it rests among other detritus. George is driving along the road in his Le Baron. Over the usual engine noise can be heard a metallic rasping, grinding noise. George listens for a few moments, wondering where it's coming from. Then he looks concerned, then angry.
GEORGE Pop! POP!! Lobby Kramer and Jerry stand in the lobby. Kramer smoking his pipe, Jerry massaging his neck. Lloyd wanders over to join them.
LLOYD 's a great movie, huh?
KRAMER Yeah.
LLOYD Sorry you forgot those glasses.
JERRY I don't know what I was thinking.
LLOYD How'd you like that gum?
JERRY Errh.
KRAMER Ah, he loved it. Elaine enters. In the absence of the button she lost in the auditorium, her blouse is open to below her breasts, and everything's in the shop window. Not that she knows it.
ELAINE Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there, in the ladies' room.
KRAMER Yeah, yeah. It's being repaired. Elaine is suffering with her neck. She rolls her head back and feels the back of her neck with her hand.
ELAINE Oh. Oh God.
LLOYD You alright? Elaine stretches her back and neck, at the same time pushing her upperworks into greater prominence.
ELAINE Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out in a hot bath. It was nice to see you again, Lloyd. Elaine leaves. Kramer and Lloyd both stare after her. Elaine walks down the sidewalk, her blouse still open. A florist is using a hose to wash down the sidewalk in front of his store. Elaine carefully steps by, picking her way past. The florist also stares at Elaine's exposure. A cop stands a little further down the street. Elaine approaches him.
ELAINE Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always be using a hose? I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk. It's a waste of water. Couldn't he just use a broom? The cop stares at Elaine's breasts the whole time she's talking.
COP Lady, you sold me. Hey, you with the hose. Elaine looks confused about his attitude. She glances down, and notices her blouse wide open. She quickly pulls her coat closed, to hide her embarrassment, and hurries away. Kramer is handing Jerry a pair of spectacles.
KRAMER Yeah, put these glasses on.
JERRY Well, what's this for?
KRAMER Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now.
JERRY So what?
KRAMER Well, he thinks you wear those. Jerry looks at the glasses with some distaste.
KRAMER They're from the lost and found at the Alex.
JERRY Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these on.
KRAMER Oh. Okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit with him on purpose. Ooh yeah, that's very nice. Very nice. George leans on the counter by the cash register, behind which sits Ruthie Cohen.
GEORGE 'scuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe I paid you with a twenty dollar bill, but you only gave me change for a ten.
CASHIER I don't think so.
GEORGE Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on the bill and uh, so if you have a twenty in there with big lips on it... well, that's mine. Would you mind opening up the register?
CASHIER Not unless you buy something.
GEORGE Fine, I'll buy a pack of gum. Lloyd approaches the register to pay for something. The cashier rings up George's purchase.
LLOYD Hey George. Thought you didn't chew gum?
GEORGE I don't. Ruthie opens the drawer on the register.
CASHIER Take a look. George goes round to the other side of the register and picks up all the twenty-dollar bills. He shuffles through them, examining them for doodles.
GEORGE I know I gave it to you.
LLOYD George, would you mind. I'm kind of in a hurry. In addition to Lloyd, another customer is waiting to pay.
GEORGE Fine. Fine. Excuse me. Think I'm gonna forget about this? I haven't forgotten about this. I don't forget that easily! Jerry is reading a newspaper, and holding it in such a way as to conceal his face.
KRAMER Hey, Jerry, look who's here. Jerry folds over the top half of the paper, in order to see his visitor. He also reveals to all that he is wearing the spectacles Kramer gave him earlier.
JERRY Ah, Lloyd.
LLOYD Hi Jerry. Got some more of that gum. He proffers the packet to Jerry.
JERRY Oh, the gum.
KRAMER Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh?
JERRY Uh, alright.
KRAMER Oh, boy. Kramer and Lloyd sit on the couch. All of them start chewing on the gum.
KRAMER Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies, sitting around, chewing gum, huh? Mmm, mmm, yeah. So uh, you know, Lloyd, he thinks he can get more of this. Jerry makes a show of removing his glasses and cleaning them.
JERRY Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to. Jerry puts his glasses back on.
LLOYD Actually, the importer's right in Chinatown. I'll introduce you to him, you can get it whenever you want.
JERRY 's not necessary.
KRAMER Hey, Jerry, you know, Lloyd wants to do you a favour.
JERRY I know that, Kramer.
LLOYD Well, if you don't want to...
KRAMER No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry, he appreciates it. Don't you, Jerry?
JERRY Yes I do, Kramer.
LLOYD So...
KRAMER Yeah?
LLOYD How about that Elaine today, huh?
KRAMER Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?
LLOYD She was practically undressing in front of me at the theatre.
JERRY I didn't see anything.
KRAMER Yeah, you uh, really missed a show, buddy. Wooh, ba-boom, ba-boom-ba-ba-ba-boom-ba. They continue to chew on the gum. Lloyd seemingly happily, Jerry clearly not liking it, and Kramer not liking it, but unwilling to show it to Lloyd. George and Deena sit on a bench.
DEENA You're probably wondering why I wanted to see you again. George clearly thinks he's clicked.
GEORGE Well, you know. It's understandable. He pats Deena on the knee.
DEENA I'm glad you feel that way. Because since my father's breakdown I uh, become very sensitive to the warning signs.
GEORGE Warning signs?
DEENA Nervousness, irritability, paranoia.
GEORGE What? Wh... what're you talking about? I'm not the one with the problem. Lloyd Braun was in the nuthouse, not me.
DEENA Yet again, taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others.
GEORGE All my friends do that.
DEENA George, I'm only trying to help... George is staring past Deena at something a short distance away.
DEENA I'm... I'm concerned. George? George, are you listening to me?
GEORGE You see that woman on the horse? Ruthie Cohen is passing by on horseback.
GEORGE She stole twenty dollars from me. Yeah, I might've gotten it back, but Lloyd Braun interfered!
DEENA So again it all comes back to Lloyd.
GEORGE Hey! Hey, you! Come back here!! Don't gallop away!! George runs away, yelling after the retreating Ruthie Cohen. Jerry and George sit in a booth. There's a different cashier on duty.
JERRY So you say she was on a horse?
GEORGE I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money.
JERRY Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. See if any high-flying cashier's been throwing twenty dollar bills around with big lips. Elaine enters.
ELAINE Hey.
JERRY Well, if it isn't Chesty La Rue.
ELAINE What?
JERRY I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the Alex.
ELAINE Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was wide open. I musta left it at the theatre.
JERRY Maybe it's in the lost and found.
ELAINE Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button too, you know. It's antique ivory. It was my mother's.
JERRY You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you ate it. Lobby Kramer greets a small elderly gent.
KRAMER Mr Har-harwood. Well, what an unexpected surprise to have you back at the Alex Theatre.
HAARWOOD Well I, I'm in a bit of a quandary. I've misplaced my spectacles.
KRAMER Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we? Kramer ducks behind the counter to retrieve the lost and found box.
HAARWOOD They're half-glasses. Kramer pops his head up, a thought having occurred.
KRAMER Brown?
HAARWOOD Mmm, yes, yes. Kramer places the cardboard box marked 'Lost and Found' on the counter.
KRAMER Uh, yeah. Ah, well if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll turn up soon. Listen, could you keep an eye on the place? I wanna go out and get some paraffin wax, and bring out the lustre of this vintage countertop.
HAARWOOD Certainly. Kramer leaves. Haarwood begins to rummage through the contents of the box. After a few seconds, he finds something. He lifts it out for a closer look. It's the button Elaine dropped earlier.
HAARWOOD Oh my goodness. What a spanking button. Street Outside Alex George starts his car. It's still making unhealthy noises. As he sits with the engine running, a car pulls up in the street behind him. The driver sounds the horn at George as he sits in his parking spot.
GEORGE Alright. Alright. The horn sounds again.
GEORGE Hang on, it's warming up! The horn sounds several more times, impatiently. George has had enough. He climbs out of his car.
GEORGE Oh you mother... George stalks round his car and up to the driver's window of the car sounding its horn.
GEORGE Hey! What is your problem? The driver rolls down the window, and we see Ruthie Cohen.
GEORGE Oh, hello, it's you! Listen lady, I got six minutes left on that meter, and I'm not budging til you admit you stole my twenty dollars. Huh-hu-hur, you're not so tough when you're not on your horse, are you Ruthie?
CASHIER Your car's on fire. The reflection of leaping flames can be seen in Ruthie's window. George dashes off back to his car.
GEORGE Aah! Fire!
CASHIER Merry Christmas! Flames are coming from under the hood of the Le Baron.
GEORGE Fire!! The florist is standing holding a broom. George rushes to him.
GEORGE Your hose! Where's your hose?!
FLORIST Cop made me disconnect it. George grabs the broom from the florist, and begins beating at the flames with no effect. After a few seconds, the broom is alight. The whole front of George's car is burnt out. The plastic body parts have melted away. The hood is wide open, showing the devastation within. George stands, holding the charred remnants of the broom. He's staring catatonically at the damage. Kramer walks up and does a double-take at the sight.
KRAMER Jeez! What happened to your car, buddy?
GEORGE The Jon Voight car is no more.
KRAMER Wow. Well, don't you sweat it. You can use my car any time you want to.
GEORGE No kidding?
KRAMER No kidding.
GEORGE Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one.
KRAMER Yeah, merry Christmas. Kramer walks on.
GEORGE Whatever. Lobby Jerry is waiting. He's wearing the glasses from earlier.
JERRY Alright, I'm here. Where's Braun?
KRAMER What, he's not here yet?
JERRY Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!
KRAMER Listen, I'm gonna need those glasses. Kramer reaches across and plucks the glasses from Jerry's face.
JERRY Why?
KRAMER They're Geoffrey Haarwood's. Kramer rummages in lost and found, and brings out another pair of spectacles.
KRAMER Here, try this pair. Jerry puts them on. The lenses are much stronger than the first pair - they're like bottle-bottoms. He stares through them, his eyes magnified hugely. It's obvious he can't see at all clearly.
JERRY Aw, these are really strong glasses. He takes a step and almost trips over the counter.
LLOYD Hey gum-buddy. Nice frames. You ready to go?
JERRY Yeah, yeah.
KRAMER Oh yeah, he's all ready to go.
LLOYD Anybody see Elaine today?
KRAMER Oh yeah, she called a little earlier. She's coming over to check out lost and found.
LLOYD Maybe I'll stick around and see what she's wearing today. Or not wearing, if you know what I mean. They chuckle.
JERRY Absolutely. Let's just stick around.
LLOYD Ah, tell you what, they're expecting us though. Lemme just grab a hotdog here.
KRAMER Uh, yeah. Lloyd goes to the counter, and speaks to the attendant.
LLOYD I'd like a hotdog, please. The attendant looks to the machine, which contains one hotdog. The appearance of the article is not pleasant. It's wrinkled, shriveled, and generally disgusting.
ATTENDANT Are you outta your mind? Hearing this, Kramer dashes over.
KRAMER Wh...wh...wh... what's the problem here?
ATTENDANT This hotdog's been here since the silent era. You'd have to be insane to eat it.
KRAMER No, no, no, no, no. This man is not insane. Now there's nothing wrong with it or you.
LLOYD Kramer, maybe...
KRAMER No, no, no, no. I'll show you. One hotdog please.
ATTENDANT Okay.
KRAMER Mmm, doesn't that smell good, huh? The attendant hands over the hotdog.
KRAMER Yeah, here we go, yeah. Mmm, oh. That's delicious. Mmm. It's a perfectly sane food to eat. As he chews, it begins to be apparent that all is not as it should be with the hotdog.
KRAMER Uhm, interesting texture. It's chewy. I gotta get, some air. Kramer stumbles toward the exit, bits of half-chewed hotdog falling from his mouth. Kramer walks stiffly along the sidewalk. He's breathing heavily, and loosening his collar. He walks by the florist, who is brushing the sidewalk again. As Kramer passes George's car, his struggle with the rancid hotdog ends with the hotdog triumphant, and he leans into the gutter behind the Le Baron and vomits copiously. The florist looks rueful, leans his broom against his door, and fetches his hose, whilst Kramer continues his refunding. Later The florist is hosing away the traces of Kramer's visit. Elaine walks up to him.
ELAINE Excuse me. 'scuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose?
FLORIST How would you happen to know that?
ELAINE Well, uhm... I...
FLORIST You're that lady that was talking to the cops, aren't you?
ELAINE Uh... I... A voice calls from across the street.
VOICE Hey, Joe! The florist turns to see who's shouting. As he does, he raises the nozzle of his hose, so instead of hosing the sidewalk, he sprays Elaine.
ELAINE No, wait! You're soaking me, you're soaking me! The florist notices what he's done and turns off the hose. Lobby Jerry sits beside Kramer, who still looks unwell. Lloyd stands comforting Kramer. Elaine enters. She has removed her jacket, and is wearing a wringing wet t-shirt.
ELAINE Hey. Hey everybody.
LLOYD Whoah, Elaine! Once again, you've managed to top yourself. C'mon Jerry, let's go. Car's out front. Lloyd leaves. Jerry stands and peers about himself through the over-strength glasses. All he can make out are vague blurred shapes.
JERRY Lloyd? He moves across the lobby, slowly, holding his hands out to feel for obstacles.
JERRY Lloyd? Jerry leaves.
ELAINE What is Lloyd's problem?
KRAMER Look, honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you, but this is too much. Parading around in a wet T-shirt.
ELAINE Uhh, I got sprayed with a hose.
KRAMER Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but the Alex is a family theatre, not one of your swing joints. Elaine casts her eyes heavenward. The remains of George's car are being towed away. On the opposite side of the road, watching, are Deena and George.
DEENA So, you want my father to pay for this?
GEORGE You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what he did there.
DEENA And I suppose Lloyd Braun had something to do with it too.
GEORGE No, not Lloyd Braun. But the cashier.
DEENA What cashier?
GEORGE You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot.
DEENA To park her horse?
GEORGE No, she wasn't on the horse.
DEENA So, your car caught fire because of my father and the woman on the horse?
GEORGE That's right. Across the street, the florist is outside his store, arranging flowers.
GEORGE And him!
DEENA The man with the flowers?
GEORGE Yeah, yeah, the flower guy. Listen, I know this all sounds a little crazy, but... A car pulls up beside George and Deena. George looks in the window.
GEORGE I can't believe it. Look, that's Jerry Seinfeld.
DEENA Who?
GEORGE Jerry Seinfeld. My best friend. He can explain all of this. Jerry. Jerry hears his name called and turns his head, but all he can see are blurry colored shapes.
GEORGE Jerry! Over here Jerry. It's me! The car pulls away, leaving George calling after it.
GEORGE Jerry, where y'going? It's... what're...
DEENA That was your best friend?
GEORGE Yeah, yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses.
DEENA That man was wearing glasses.
GEORGE I know. Don't you see. He was doing it to fool Lloyd Braun! Jerry and Lloyd have reached Chinatown. Lloyd parks the car.
LLOYD I'll run in and get the gum.
JERRY Alright.
LLOYD Got any money? Jerry digs his wallet out of his pocket. He opens it and extracts a bill. He peers at it, trying to work out what denomination it is, but the glasses are still too strong.
JERRY Here. Lloyd takes the bill, looks at it, smiles a little with surprise.
LLOYD I'll be back. George and Deena walk along together.
GEORGE Look, Deena, I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not. This is just a series of bad coincidences.
DEENA I don't know, George. I don't know what to believe.
GEORGE Believe me, I am not crazy.
DEENA Well, I guess it's possible. Jerry sits waiting. Lloyd gets in. He has a stack of six boxes, which he hands to Jerry.
LLOYD Here y'go.
JERRY Got all this?
LLOYD Yeah. A hundred dollar's worth.
JERRY I gave you a hundred dollars?!
LLOYD You sure did. Am I crazy, or is that a lotta gum?
JERRY It's a lotta gum! The room is festooned with props and costumes from old movies.
KRAMER Mr Hararwood. Found your glasses.
HAARWOOD Oh, splendid. Welcome to the Institute for the Preservation of Motion Picture Costumes and Wardrobe.
KRAMER Ah, the I.P.M.P.C.W.
HAARWOOD Well eh, we prefer to call it the Institute. Kramer notices a particular costume.
KRAMER Is that from Henry the Eighth?
HAARWOOD Yes, yes, it is.
KRAMER Well, you know, we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do you think that I could wear that to promote the theatre?
HAARWOOD Well, I... I'd love to lend it to you, but I doubt if it would fit a man of your impressive, Raymond Massey-like, physique. The only person who could really fit into this costume, would have to be a short, stocky, man of somewhat generous proportions.
KRAMER You don't say. Kramer and George walk together. George is wearing the Henry VIII costume - doublet and hose, cloak, crown, etc.
KRAMER You're really helping me out with this, buddy. Kids are gonna be so thrilled.
GEORGE Yeah, yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick.
KRAMER Remember, you're a king, you must project a Royal bearing.
GEORGE Oh, I'm gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Lemme get a pack of gum here. He gets his wallet from under the cape, and goes to the window of a kiosk.
GEORGE Can I get a pack of gum, please?
GUY I beg your pardon, your majesty, but we don't accept bills with lipstick on the president.
GEORGE What? Huh, so I had it all along. How d'you like that? I guess I owe that cashier an apology. Deena is walking toward George and Kramer. She sees George in his costume and jumps to the obvious conclusion.
DEENA Oh my God!
GEORGE No, no. Deena, it's not what you think. Deena turns and begins to walk away.
GEORGE Th... this isn't mine. George begins to walk after Deena, who accelerates to a trot.
GEORGE I got it from the Institute. The Institute. Deena breaks into a run, with George chasing her.
GEORGE Dee... Deena! Lobby Kramer stands behind the counter, upon which Elaine leans. Mr Haarwood enters.
KRAMER Ahh, Mr Haarwood. Well, you certainly know how to dress for a premiere.
HAARWOOD Well, thank you. Uh, where is your friend King Henry?
KRAMER Oh, he ran away. Lloyd enters.
LLOYD Hey Kramer.
KRAMER I need to talk to you. Lloyd and Kramer go away to the side of the lobby, where they go into a quiet conversation. Elaine is peering over at Mr Haarwood, and in particular at the button he's wearing on his cravat.
ELAINE You know, that button looks very familiar.
HAARWOOD Yes, it, it, it's antique ivory.
ELAINE I, I think that's my button. You know, I've been looking all over for it. Did, did you find it here?
HAARWOOD Yes, it was in the lost and found.
ELAINE Shall I undo it?
HAARWOOD Oh yes, of course you can.
ELAINE Oh, thank you. Elaine moves very close to Mr Haarwood, and reaches under his chin to remove the button.
HAARWOOD I'm a little ticklish.
ELAINE Oh. Tickle, tickle. Kramer and Lloyd are both staring over at the sight of Elaine tickling Mr Haarwood under the chin, giggling, apparently flirting.
LLOYD We've really gotta get the Elaine a boyfriend.
KRAMER Oh, tell me about it.
FRANK I got no leg room back here. Move your seat forward.
ESTELLE That's as far as it goes.
FRANK There's a mechanism. You just pull it, and throw your body weight.
ESTELLE I pulled it. It doesn't go.
FRANK If you want the leg room, say you want the leg room! Don't blame the mechanism!
GEORGE All right, Dad, we're five blocks from the house. Sit sideways.
FRANK Like an animal. Because of her, I have to sit here like an animal! Serenity now! Serenity now!
GEORGE What is that?
FRANK Doctor gave me a relaxation cassette. When my blood pressure gets too high, the man on the tape tells me to say, 'Serenity now!'
GEORGE Are you supposed to yell it?
FRANK The man on the tape wasn't specific.
GEORGE What happened to the screen door? It blew off again?
ESTELLE I told you to fix that thing.
FRANK Serenity nowww!
PATTY So I told Bobby and Lisa that we'd try the new Chinese Spanish place La Caridad on Saturday.
JERRY Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener.
PATTY Well I thought this would be more fun so I gave the tickets away.
JERRY What? All right, fine.
PATTY Are you mad at me?
JERRY No, I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is.
PATTY You know... I've never seen you mad.
JERRY I get peeved.
PATTY Mad.
JERRY Miffed.
PATTY Mad.
JERRY Irked?
PATTY I'd like to see you get really mad.
GEORGE Why does she want you to be mad?
JERRY She says I suppress my emotions.
GEORGE So what do you care what she thinks.
JERRY Good body.
GEORGE She probably gets that impression because you're cool. You're under control. Like me. Nothing wrong with that.
JERRY But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell.
GEORGE Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic pitch.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all my food. Now shut that door and get the hell out of here!
KRAMER What is that, a new bit?
GEORGE I told ya. Hey, any of you guys want to come out and help me fix my father's screen door in Queens?
JERRY Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx.
KRAMER I'll do it.
GEORGE Really? You wanna come?
KRAMER Yeah, I love going to the country.
ELAINE Where are they goin'?
JERRY Fix a screen door in Queens.
ELAINE That's funny. Hey, listen, what are you doin' Saturday night?
JERRY Not goin' to the Knick game.
ELAINE I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar Mitzvah.
JERRY You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering. You should be able to buy a cheaper gift.
ELAINE Oh, I don't think that's possible.
KRAMER Get in a little closer. I can't see the screen door. Perfect.
GEORGE Dad, the hinges are all rusted here. That's why the wind keeps blowing the door off.
ESTELLE I hate that old door. Throw it out!
FRANK Serenity now!
KRAMER It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked hard for ya.
FRANK Will you put her to rest for me?
KRAMER Oh yeah, I'll take good care of her.
ESTELLE Get George to put those boxes in the garage.
GEORGE Dad, what's all this?
ESTELLE It's junk.
FRANK My computers. I've been selling them for two months now. Shut up!
GEORGE You're selling computers?
FRANK Two months ago, I saw a provocative movie on cable TV. It was called The Net, with that girl from the bus. I did a little reading, and I realize, it wasn't that farfetched.
GEORGE Dad, you know what it takes to compete with Microsoft and IBM?
FRANK Yes, I do. That's why I got a secret weapon... my son.
JERRY Damn it, they gave me cream! I asked for nonfat milk!
PATTY OK, Jerry, enough. I'm not buying it.
JERRY You're damn right you're not buying it!
PATTY You shouldn't have to try. It's just being open.
JERRY I'm open. There's just nothing in there.
PATTY Sarcastically Uh huh.
JERRY Oh, you think I'm lying about this?
PATTY I think you are.
JERRY Well, I'm not.
PATTY Yes, you are, liar.
JERRY Oh, stop it.
PATTY OK, liar.
JERRY That's enough!
PATTY Ooh, that was good.
JERRY Really? It felt good.
ELAINE Congratulations, Mr. Lippman.
LIPPMAN Oh, Elaine. My boy's a man today. Can you believe it? He's a man.
ELAINE Oh, congratulations, Adam.
ADAM I'm a man!
JERRY Tongue?
ELAINE Yeah.
GEORGE Wow! I didn't try that 'til I was 23.
JERRY Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man.
ELAINE And I think he's been telling his friends. I got invitations to six more Bar Mitzvahs.
JERRY Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. No, no, no, I do not want to stop over in Cincinnati. Well, then you upgrade me. That's right, you should thank me. Goodbye. Hey, I'm flyin' first class.
ELAINE Where did that come from?
JERRY Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that?
ELAINE No.
JERRY Good.
GEORGE All right, relax, tough guy. I got to go out to my father's garage, help him sell some computers.
JERRY What? The two of you workin' in that garage is like a steel cage death match.
GEORGE Kramer.
KRAMER Yeah.
GEORGE What-what are you doing?
KRAMER Oh, I'm putting up Frank's screen door. This beauty's got a little life in her yet.
JERRY What do you need it for?
KRAMER The cool evening breezes of Anytown, USA. Let's see how this baby closes. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
GEORGE Morning, ma.
ESTELLE You're late!
GEORGE Morning, dad.
FRANK I'm not 'dad' in the workplace. My professional name is Mr. Costanza, and I will refer to you as 'Costanza'. Morning, Braun.
LLOYD Morning, George. Two cream, no sugar.
GEORGE What is Lloyd Braun doing here?
FRANK Your mother recommended him.
GEORGE Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing up is 'Why can't you be more like Lloyd Braun?' Did you know he was in a mental institution?
FRANK I didn't read his resume.
BRAUN Another sale, Mr. Costanza. Chalk me up on the big board.
GEORGE What is this? Frank This is your lagging. Good work, Braun. Estelle Good for you, Lloyd!
ELAINE So Adam, I just talked to your father, and, apology accepted.
ADAM I'm not apologizing. It was great. I told everyone.
ELAINE Yeah, I know. Uh, by the way, could you do me a favor and tell Mitchell Tanenbaum that I will be unable to attend this Saturday.
ADAM Are you free Friday night?
ELAINE I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and I am in my early... 20s.
ADAM But I'm a man. The rabbi said so.
ELAINE No. You are not a man. It takes a long time to become a man. I mean, half my friends aren't even there yet.
ADAM Well, if I'm not a man, then this whole thing was a sham! First, they said I was gonna get great gifts, and then, somebody gives me Boggle. I renounce my religion!
LIPPMAN Who wants cookies?
ADAM As of this moment, I am no longer Jewish. I quit!
LIPPMAN What?
ELAINE Walnuts, mmmmmm.
FRANK You're late again, Costanza, so listen up. Starting tonight, we're having a little sales contest. The loser gets fired, the winner gets a Waterpik.
ESTELLE You're not giving away our Waterpik!
FRANK Serenity now!
GEORGE You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit!
FRANK I guess your mother was right. You never could compete with Lloyd Braun!
GEORGE You wanna sell computers? I will show you how to sell computers! Hello, Mr. Farneman. You wanna buy a computer? No? Why not? All right, I see! Good answer! Thank you! Serenity now!
ELAINE Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your father. It takes time. Patience, experience. Uh, several careers of varying success. And these are things I look for in a man.
ADAM Well, that does me a lot of good. 'Early 20s'!
ELAINE Well, I'm sorry, sir, I tried.
LIPPMAN So, that's the type of guy you're looking for?
ELAINE Uhh. I guess so. Why?
PATTY What is this?
JERRY Anytown, U.S.A. Hello? Is Kramer home? Oh, hey.
KRAMER Hello, neighbor.
JERRY Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely.
KRAMER Oh, you gotta mulch. You've got to.
JERRY You barbecuing tonight?
KRAMER Right after the fireworks.
JERRY So, where do you want to eat tonight?
PATTY How about La Caridad again?
JERRY Again!? How much flan can a person eat!?
PATTY Jerry, you've been yelling at me all afternoon.
JERRY Well, I don't think more flan is the answer!
PATTY Maybe I should just leave.
JERRY 'Maybe'!?
PATTY Good-bye!
JERRY Double good-bye!
KRAMER Hey, buddy!
ELAINE Hey. Happy New Year! Kramer Y'all come back reeeaall...
ELAINE Did you and Patty just break up?
JERRY Yeah! In fact, she broke up with me! And I don't want to talk about it!
ELAINE Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard about this great place called La Caridad.
JERRY That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there also, but I wasn't in the mood.
ELAINE Whoa. What is the matter?
JERRY It's Patty.
ELAINE Jerry, you break up with a girl every week.
JERRY What--what is this salty discharge?
ELAINE Oh my God. You're crying.
JERRY This is horrible! I care!
JERRY Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without her.
KRAMER She's really gotten to you, hasn't she?
JERRY I don't know what's happening to me.
KRAMER Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come with it. It's like Endora's box.
JERRY That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora.
KRAMER Yeah, well, she... had one, too.
GEORGE Jerry, can I talk to you for a second?
KRAMER That's it, that's it! I warned you kids. I told you not to play in front of my house. This time, I'm keepin' it. And you're not getting back your rock either!
GEORGE Are you still down in the dumps? Come on. It's just a chick.
JERRY You ever heard of a little thing called feelings?
GEORGE Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer! Huh? We can check porn, and stock quotes.
JERRY Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George. Ever tell you how much I love you?
GEORGE What?
JERRY I love you, George. Come here.
GEORGE I-I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here. Uh, you know what? If you want a computer, call me. I-I gotta go.
JERRY Go wherever you want. I'm still gonna love you.
KRAMER Look what they did. Look what they did to my house! I turn my back for two seconds, and they put shaving cream all over my door. You, I see you! I'll teach these kids a lesson. Where's that house I put under your sink?
JERRY Hose under my sink. I love you, Kramer!
KRAMER I love you, too, buddy, and George--
GEORGE I don't want to hear it, Kramer!
KRAMER Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to turn this water on full blast.
GEORGE What signal? What-what signal?
KRAMER I'll yell, uh, 'Hoochie mama!'
GEORGE If I do it, will you buy a computer?
KRAMER On the signal, George. On the signal.
GEORGE Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale.
JERRY I love you, Costanza.
GEORGE Will you shut up?!
KRAMER Now! Now, George! Turn on the faucet! George, turn on the faucet! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mamamaaaaa!
ELAINE So now the other Lippman kissed me.
GEORGE Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa.
ELAINE What?
GEORGE It means a non-Jewish woman.
ELAINE I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have to do with it?
GEORGE You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of meeting a woman that's not like their mother.
ELAINE Oh, that's insane.
GEORGE I'll tell you what's insane: the price that I could get you on a new desktop computer.
ELAINE I am not buying a computer from you.
GEORGE There's porn.
ELAINE Even so.
GEORGE Damn it!
ELAINE Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that you found me attractive enough to... lunge at me. Huh. But the only reason you like me is because I'm a shiksa.
LIPPMAN That's simply not true.
ELAINE If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me.
LIPPMAN You are wrong. I'll prove it.
ELAINE Oh, no. Don't!
LIPPMAN I renounce Judaism!
ELAINE Oy vey!
JERRY What happened to you, pal?
KRAMER Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They ambushed me with a box of 'Grade A's.
JERRY Are you all right?
KRAMER Oh, no. I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity now.
JERRY So, you're using Frank's relaxation method? Kramer Jerry, the anger, it just melts right off. Serenity now. Look at this. Serenity now! Elaine Hey, what happened to you?
KRAMER Serenity!
ELAINE Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is renounced. This shiksa thing is totally out of control. What is with you people? What are you looking at?
JERRY Sit down, Elaine.
ELAINE Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing.
JERRY I've been thinking about what it means to be complete.
ELAINE Do you have an apple or anything?
JERRY Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble.
ELAINE Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine.
JERRY Looking everywhere for some kind of meaning...
ELAINE Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ahh, banana!
JERRY When all the while, the real secret to happiness has been right in front of us!
ELAINE What?
JERRY Elaine...
GEORGE Jerry, I've found a way to beat Lloyd Braun! I buy the computers myself, I store 'em in your apartment. Then, after I win the contest, I bring 'em all back and get my money back. Ha ha! It's brilliant. What? What's wrong with your leg?
JERRY I'm asking Elaine to marry me. George I'll store these over at Kramer's apartment.
JERRY Elaine?
ELAINE Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman right now.
JERRY Lippman? Elaine Yeah, and him too. What?! Oh, yeah! I think George is calling me, so I'm gonna go give him a hand. Come on! Come on!
JERRY Can I help you?
ELAINE No. Stay! Stay. Stay.
FRANK Hey, Braun, Costanza's kicking your butt! George Watch how it's done. Oh, hello, Mr. Vandelay? Would you like to buy a computer? Oh, really? Two dozen?
FRANK Costanza, you're white hot!
PHONE If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and--
FRANK Hey, Braun, I got good news and bad news. And they're both the
SAME you're fired. Costanza, you've won the water pik!
ESTELLE You're not gonna give away that water pik!
FRANK You wanna bet? Serenity now, serenity now!
LLOYD You know, you should tell your dad that 'serenity now' thing doesn't work. It just bottles up the anger, and eventually, you blow.
GEORGE What do you know? You were in the nut house.
LLOYD What do you think put me there?
GEORGE I heard they found a family in your freezer
LLOYD Serenity now. Insanity later.
JERRY What happened here, Kramer?
KRAMER Serenity now, serenity now...
JERRY Kramer!
KRAMER Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in. Yeah, the children, they've done sum redecorating. Serenity now, serenity now.
JERRY You don't look well.
KRAMER Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with the world- uh! eggs! you! Serenity now, serenity now, serenity now.
JERRY Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose. Kramer Jerry, come on. Don't get upset about it. There's always next spring. Now will you excuse me for a moment. Serenity nooooooooww!
GEORGE Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun!
KRAMER Serenity now!
GEORGE Come on, wanna give me a hand with the computers?
KRAMER Serenity nooooowwwww!
GEORGE Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls to get your stress out? Why did you have to destroy twenty-five computers?
KRAMER George, you listen to me. I owe ya one.
JERRY He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it?
GEORGE Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't handle it.
JERRY George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done. Sure I'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making shallow, fairly-obvious observations. How about you?
GEORGE All right... here goes...
ELAINE Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this Shiks-appeal?
RABBI Ha! Elaine, shiks-appeal is a myth, like the Yeti, or his North American cousin, the Sasquatch.
ELAINE Well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied Israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop.
RABBI Elaine, there's much you don't understand about the Jewish religion. For example, did you know that rabbis are allowed to date?
ELAINE Well, what does that have to do...?
RABBI You know, a member of my congregation has a timeshare in Myrtle Beach. Perhaps, if you're not too busy, we could wing on down after the High Holidays? Elaine? 'Lainie?
GEORGE So, that's it. All of my darkest fears, and... everything I'm capable of. That's me.
JERRY Yikes. Well, good luck with all that.
GEORGE Where you going? I-I thought I could count on you for a little compassion.
JERRY I think you scared me straight.
ELAINE All right, Jerome, I'm in.
JERRY What?
ELAINE Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is right here in front of us. Jer... let's do it.
JERRY I tell ya, I don't see it happening.
ELAINE What? What happened to the new Jerry?
JERRY He doesn't work here anymore.
ELAINE Oh, well that's just great!
GEORGE I love you, Jerry. Jerry Right back at ya, Slick.
GEORGE You know, all these years, I've always wanted to see the two of you get back together.
ELAINE Well, that's because you're an idiot.
FRANK You single-handedly brought Costanza and Son to the brink of bankruptcy.
GEORGE Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales?
FRANK He's crazy. His phone wasn't even hooked up. He just liked ringing that bell.
ESTELLE I told you to clean out this garage. I have to put my car in!
FRANK This is a place of business. I told you never to come in here. Serenity now!
ESTELLE All right...
GEORGE Dad, you really should lay off the 'serenity now' stuff.
FRANK So, what am I supposed to say?
GEORGE 'Hoochie mama'?
ESTELLE Move your crap, I'm comin' in!
FRANK No you're not! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama!
KRAMER All right, Coney Island. Ok, you can take the B or the F and switch for the N at Broadway Lafayette, or you can go over the bridge to DeKalb and catch the Q to Atlantic Avenue, then switch to the IRT 2, 3, 4 or 5, but don't get on the G. See that's very tempting, but you wind up on Smith and 9th street, then you got to get on the R.
ELAINE Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney Island?
KRAMER Well, yeah...
ELAINE Ok, what time is your job interview George?
GEORGE 9:45
JERRY Remember, don't whistle on the elevator.
GEORGE Why not?
JERRY That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, in 'Death of a salesman'.
GEORGE What, you are comparing me to Biff Loman, very encouraging. The biggest loser in history of American literature.
ELAINE All right, I'm gonna go.
JERRY What time is the lesbian wedding?
ELAINE 9:30
GEORGE Lesbian wedding. How do they work bride and groom out, what do they flip a coin?
ELAINE Yeah, they flip a coin.
GEORGE What, was that not politically correct? It's a legitimate question.
JERRY I'm so tired. I'll fall asleep on that train
GEORGE I get the feeling when lesbians are looking at me, they're thinking "That's why I'm not heterosexual".
KRAMER Jerry, come on let's go, pick up the check so we can go.
JERRY Oh, I'm paying for breakfast?
KRAMER Yeah.
ELAINE Yeah.
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY Why do I always pay? What am I made of money? You bunch of deadbeats.
GEORGE How many tickets are you paying today?
KRAMER Well, let's see: speeding, running a red light, no license, no registration, no plates, no brake lights, no rear view mirror...yeah.
GEORGE No doors?
KRAMER I'm fighting that one. You know, this is gonna cost me over six hundred bucks.
GEORGE I can't carry any changes in these pants, it falls out.
VIOLIN_PLAYER Thank you.
GEORGE That guy is not blind.
JERRY So, can I convince anybody to come down to Coney Island with me? I got to pick up my car at the pound. George?
GEORGE I can't believe they actually found your stolen car.
JERRY Not only that they found it. It was simonized and the front end was aligned.
GEORGE That's amazing.
JERRY So what do you say? Run in the cyclone. Hotdogs on Nathan's is on me.
GEORGE What are you? Satan? I'm close to a job here. It's my second interview with them.
JERRY All right, biff. Elaine, merry-go-round?
ELAINE I can't. I'm the best man.
JERRY Kramer, bumper-cars?
KRAMER I've gotta go to court, I'll get in trouble. What's the matter with you?
JERRY Could be years before I get back to Coney Island. I can't go to rides alone.
SUBWAY_ANNOUNCEMENT 42th street. Change to D,N,RR,2,3,4,5,7,C,E,F train.
ELAINE See'ya.
WOMAN You looking for a job?
GEORGE Me, why?
WOMAN Well, you're reading the classifieds.
GEORGE Oh, no no no. I was just looking for stock-pages. Here it is. Looking for the quotes. Gotta check to quotes. Love a good quote. Oh, IBM up a quarter.
WOMAN You didn't look like someone who needed a job.
GEORGE Me? No, no, I don't, I don't. Doing very well, very well, yep.
WOMAN So, you're in 'the market'?
GEORGE Yeah I'm, eh, in 'the market'.
WOMAN Which market?
GEORGE Which market, the, eh, big one, the big market, the big board. Bull market, bear market, you name the market, I'm there.
WOMAN So, do you work for one of those big broker-houses?
GEORGE They wish. I hate the big broker-houses. Hate them with a passion. Big broker-houses killed my father.
WOMAN Really?
GEORGE Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt his feelings. It's a long story. I- I don't like to talk about it, but I swore then that I would never work for big broker-houses. See, all they care about is money. I'm about more than money, I'm about people, always gone my own way and I've never looked back.
WOMAN I started riding these trains in the forties. Those days a man would give up their seat for a woman. Now we're liberated and we have to stand.
ELAINE It's ironic.
WOMAN What's ironic?
ELAINE This, that we've come all this way, we have made all this progress, but you know we've lost the little things, the niceties.
WOMAN No, I mean what does 'ironic' mean?
ELAINE Oh...
WOMAN Where are you up to, with such a nice present, birthday party?
ELAINE A wedding.
WOMAN A wedding?
ELAINE Yeah
WOMAN Hah, I didn't know people still get married. It's hard today with men and women.
ELAINE You're telling me.
WOMAN So, are they a nice couple?
ELAINE Oh, very nice.
WOMAN What does he do, if you don't mind me asking?
ELAINE She.
WOMAN She? She works, he doesn't. He sounds like my son.
ELAINE There is no he.
WOMAN There is no he. So, who's getting married?
ELAINE Em, two women. It's, eh...lesbian wedding.
WOMAN Lesbian wedding.
ELAINE Aha, yep. I'm the...eh...best man.
WOMAN My luck. I don't talk to a soul in the subway for 35 years. I get a best man at a lesbian wedding.
ELAINE No, no, no, you don't understand! I'm not a lesbian! I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian!
ELAINE_THINKING I'm really looking forward to this. I love weddings. Maybe I'll meet somebody, umm maybe not.
ELAINE Oh, man. We're stopping?
WOMAN Well, this is where I get off.
GEORGE Oh, you do?
WOMAN Eh, hey why don't you...oh nothing.
GEORGE No, no, what, what?
WOMAN Well, I was going to say: why don't you get off with me, but you're obviously very busy on your way to some important meeting or something.
GEORGE Yeah, well....
WOMAN Yeah I knew it was a bad idea.
GEORGE Hey, what's another million, give or take. I get off where and when I wanna get off.
GEORGE I'm stuck. Pull a little, just a second. Don't start the train! Don't start the train!!
MAN_1 This, it's the fourth horse of the first race, Pappanick.
MAN_2 How do you know it's going to win?
MAN_1 My UPS-guy tells. Guys who own the horses are regular customers. Every horse he has ever given me has won. See, they've been sandbagging and looking for a good spot. He's been getting it light cause they've been using bug boy and the workout hasn't been published. Now they are ready to run with it. They are gonna break his a lock.
MAN_2 But it rained last night.
MAN_1 Exactly, this horse loves the slop. It's in his bloodlines. His father was a mudda', his mother was a mudda'.
MAN_2 His mudda' was a mudda'?
MAN_1 What did I just say? Come on, let's go to the office, I'm going to call my bookie. Hey, don't tell anybody.
JERRY O-K. You realize of course, you're naked?
NAKED_MAN Naked, dressed. I don't see any difference.
JERRY You oughta' sit here. There is a difference.
NAKED_MAN You got something against naked body?
JERRY I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep knee bends, maybe a squat thrust?
NAKED_MAN Who's got time for squat thrusts?
JERRY All right, how about skipping breakfast. I'm guessing you're not a 'half-grapefruit and black coffee' guy.
NAKED_MAN I like a good breakfast.
JERRY I understand, I like good breakfast. Long as you don't wind up trapped in a room with bimbo broals and pigtails, been counseled by Dick Gregory.
NAKED_MAN I'm not ashamed of my body.
JERRY That's your problem, you should be.
JERRY Don't get up, please, allow me.
ELAINE_THINKING Oh, this is great. This is what I need, just what I need. Ok, take it easy I'm sure it's nothing. Probably rats on the track, we're stopping for rats. God, it's so crowded. How can there be so many people? This guy really smells, doesn't anyone use deodorant in the city? What is so hard, you take the cap off, you roll it on. What's that? I feel something rubbing against me. Disgusting animals, these people should be in a gage. We are in a gage. What if I miss the wedding? I got the ring. What'll they do? You can't get married without the ring. Oh, I can't breath, I feel faint. Take it easy, it'll start moving soon. Think about the people on the concentration camps, what they went through. And hostages, what would you do if you were a hostage? Think about that. This is nothing. No, it's not nothing, it's something. It's a nightmare! Help me! Move it! Com'on move this fu thing!! Why isn't it moving?!? What can go wrong with a train!?! It's on tracks, there's no traffic! How can a train get stuck. Step on the gas!! What could it be? You'de think the conductor would explain it to us? 'I'm sorry there's a delay we'll be moving in 5 minutes'!! I wanna hear a voice. What's that on my leg?!!
GEORGE Are you often on business trip? Nice...oh, hey nice ice-bucket.
WOMAN Make your-self comfortable. She steps in to bathroom.
GEORGE_THINKING Make myself comfortable. What does that mean? Does she want me to take my clothes off? Is she taking her clothes off? What if I take my clothes off and she still has hers' on? Then I really look like an idiot. She could get offended and leave. So maybe I should leave them on, but what then if she takes her off? Then she'll feel humiliated. 'Make yourself comfortable'. I got this unbelievable woman and this 'comfortable'-thing can ruin me. I got it! I take my shoes off and sit on the bed. There, that's comfortable. She can't accuse me being unconvertible.
GEORGE Gotta tell you I'm pretty comfortable.
KRAMER Oh yeah, it's all set. They got the bug boy on him.
GUY The bug boy.
KRAMER Yeah, the little father has run his hard out. They're gonna break his maiden.
GUY Really? But, it's a little bit slow out there it rained last night.
KRAMER Oh, this baby loves the slop, loves it, eats it up. Eats the slop. Born in the slop. His father was a mudda'.
GUY His father was a mudda'?
KRAMER His mother was a mudda'.
GUY His mother was a mudda'?
KRAMER What did I just say?
KRAMER Hey, all right, 600 Pappanick to win.
NAKED_MAN They still have no pitching. Goodin's a question mahk. ...You don't recover from those rotator cuffs so fast.
JERRY I'm not worried about their best pitching. They got pitching. ...They got no hitting.
NAKED_MAN No hitting? They got hitting! Bonilla, Murry. ...They got no defence.
JERRY Defence? Please. ...They need speed.
NAKED_MAN Speed? They got Coleman. ...They need a bullpen.
JERRY Franco's no good? ...They got no team leaders.
NAKED_MAN They got Franco! ...What they need is a front office.
JERRY But you gotta like their chances.
NAKED_MAN I LUV their chances.
JERRY Tell you what. If they win the penant I'll sit naked with you at the World Series.
NAKED_MAN It's a deal!
ELAINE_THINKING Why couldn't I take a cab. For 6 dollars my whole life could've changed. What is that on my leg? I'll never get out of here. What if I'm here for the rest of my life? Maybe I'll get out in 5 seconds. 1 banana, 2 banana, 3 banana, 4 banana, 5 banana...no, I'm still here! Still here! Why don't they start moving? Move! Move!! Move!!! Train starts moving, lights get back on It's moving! It's moving! Yes! Yes!! Train stops again and lights go off Motherf!!!
GEORGE Eh, gee, I hope you have the key for these things.
WOMAN Oh, don't worry. I do.
GEORGE You know, my mother used to walk around on our apartment just in her bra and panties. She didn't look anything like you, she was really disgusting, really bad body. If you could imagine uglier and fatter version of Shirley Booth. Remember Shirley Booth from Hazel. Really embarrassing, cause you know I had only mother in the whole neighborhood who was worse looking than Hazel. Imagine the taunts I would hear.
WOMAN Like what?
GEORGE Like a "Hey your mother is uglier than Hazel. Hazel really puts your mother to shame"
GEORGE What's going on?
WOMAN It was a pleasure doing business with you George, but I'm afraid I have to get going.
GEORGE Get going? But we haven't really, you know....
WOMAN Eight dollars? Eight dollars?
GEORGE What are you doing? You're robbing me?
WOMAN I wasted my whole morning with you for eight dollars?
GEORGE Wait, wait a second, what are you doing?
WOMAN I'm taking your clothes.
GEORGE No, that's my only suit. It cost me 350 dollars. I got it at Moe Ginsburg.
WOMAN Bye George.
GEORGE No wait, you can't just leave me here! Will I see you again?
KRAMER Yes! Yes! I won, hey
NAKED_MAN I haven't had a hotdog at Nathan's for 20 years.
JERRY First we ride the cyclone.
NAKED_MAN Chilly out.
JERRY Aah, French fries.
THUG Give me the money. Give me the money!
VIOLIN_PLAYER Freeze, Police!
JERRY No, I never got the car. We were having such a good time, by the time I got to the police garage, it was closed.
ELAINE Too bad.
JERRY You wouldn't believe what this guy put away at Nathan's. Look at what we won!
JERRY You want him?
ELAINE Get that out of my face.
JERRY So, you missed the wedding. You'll catch the bris!
GEORGE How would you like a 'Hare Krishna' fist on your throat, you little punk?
ELAINE George?
JERRY Biff, what did you whistle on the elevator?
GEORGE You have my spare-key in your apartment, right?
JERRY Yeah, it's in the kitchen drawer.
GEORGE Give me your key, I gotta get it.
KRAMER What happened?
GEORGE Never mind what happened, just give me the key.
JERRY Come on, I'll go with you.
ELAINE Here, pay.
KRAMER Wait, wait, wait...
JERRY Look at the work people do to get to the ocean. They'll fight the traffic and the heat and the parking and the hot sand. Trying to get through the waves, and the ironic thing is the ocean doesn't even want us in there. That's what surfing is. Surfing is the ocean throwing us out of itself, you see? We keep trying to paddle in, the ocean's saying, "No you don't." The ocean is like a nightclub and the waves are bouncers tossin' us out. The undertow's like a really mean bouncer. Instead of throwin' you out, they take you in back and rough you up a little bit. "Oh, you wanna come in? How 'bout comin' in like 25 miles?" back seat.
KRAMER All right, get off at the next exit.
JERRY Kramer, I've driven to the Hamptons many times, I know the exit.
KRAMER It's a great house, pool's something? Yeah, I'll be there.
JERRY You sure we're makin' the right move?
ELAINE We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a weekend in the Hamptons out of it.
JERRY Didn't they just have a baby?
ELAINE That was two years ago, remember? 'Jeh-Ree, you gotta see the Bay-Bee! You gotta see the Bay-Bee!'
JERRY Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them?
KRAMER Hey Jerry, you ever wear silk underwear?
JERRY No.
KRAMER Put that on the top of your list.
JERRY No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and Jane should be almost there by now.
ELAINE Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex yet, but they're spending the weekend together?
JERRY I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she signed a letter of intent.
ELAINE When's Rachel comin' out?
JERRY She's makin' the three o'clock train.
ELAINE Her father is so religious, I'm just amazed that he's letting you see her again after that Schindler's List make-out session.
JERRY I bought him some kishka.
KRAMER What's that?
JERRY It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry it. In case they're captured behind enemy lines, they eat it and it kills them.
GEORGE I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love.
JANE Me too. I love cough medicine.
GEORGE You see? We were made for each other. It's amazing. If I reach out and touch her breast right not, she'd scream and throw me out of the car. But at this time tomorrow, I could touch it all I want.
JANE What's your favorite?
GEORGE Potussan. Ever try it with club soda?
JANE No.
GEORGE Oh, very refreshing. Sex is like joining a private club. I'll be the same me tomorrow, but suddenly, the no trespassing sign will be gone.
JANE Are we almost there?
GEORGE Yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at a vegetable stand.
JANE What for?
GEORGE My mother loves Hampton tomatoes. She's nuts for Hampton tomatoes.
JANE Can you buy 'em later? I really wanna get some... sun.
KRAMER Hey Jerry. Rub some lotion on my back.
JERRY Who are you, Mrs. Robinson?
KRAMER Come on, I'll rub some on yours.
JERRY No, that's no sweet'ning the deal. No.
GEORGE You know, when I was a kid, I once found a dollar and fifty cents in change on the bottom of the pool.
JANE You must've been excited.
GEORGE Yeah. Hey, you know, I gotta go get these tomatoes. You wanna go for a ride?
JANE I don't think so.
GEORGE 'Kay. I'll uh, I'll see you later. Anybody want some tomatoes?
JERRY No thanks.
KRAMER No.
JANE I'm gonna take a dip.
JERRY And then there's Mog.
ELAINE Look at my face, look at it. You see any lines?
JERRY No lines.
ELAINE You know why? One word: shade.
JERRY So when're we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous event?
ELAINE I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something.
KRAMER I'm gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. Elaine, you wanna come?
ELAINE No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends.
JERRY Oh this is interesting.
ELAINE What?
JERRY Jane's topless.
KRAMER Yo yo ma.
JERRY Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
ELAINE Nice rack.
CAROL Come on, you guys. You can come on and see the bay-bee!
JERRY Oh, in a minute, Carol.
KRAMER We're gonna be right there.
JERRY This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.
ELAINE Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?
KRAMER Maybe she's trying to create a buzz.
ELAINE What?
KRAMER You know, get some good word of mouth goin'.
JERRY Oh, here she comes.
JANE I'm thirsty. Anyone want a drink?
JERRY No thanks.
ELAINE I'm good.
KRAMER Deh-deh-deh-deh- All right, show's over. I'm goin' to the beach. not far behind.
CAROL Adam , Jerry and Elaine are here.
ELAINE Oh, he's a cute little shnugly baby.
CAROL Isn't he gorgeous?
ELAINE Ugghh.
CAROL Is she gorgeous?
ELAINE Oh, gorgeous, yes.
JERRY So very gorgeous.
CAROL Michael, shut the door! You're letting bugs in. then seeing a rope leading to something he doesn't know of yet. room.
JERRY Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?
ELAINE Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese.
JERRY Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. And, you know, the thing is, they're never gonna know, no one's ever gonna tell them.
ELAINE Oh, you have to lie.
JERRY It's a must lie situation.
ELAINE Yes, it's a must lie situation.
JERRY You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane topless.
ELAINE No, I don't think so.
JERRY You know, we might want to tell Kramer.
BEN Oh this ointment should do it.
CAROL How are you feeling, Adam? Elaine! This is our pediatrician, Ben Feffa.
ELAINE Hi.
CAROL Look at him, Elaine. How gorgeous is he? I ask you, how gorgeous?
ELAINE Pretty gorgeous.
BEN Elaine, you have children?
ELAINE Me? Oh no, but I'd love to have a baby, I mean, I can't wait to have a baby. I'm just dyin' to have a baby.
BEN A beautiful woman like you should. You're quite breathtaking.
ELAINE Breathtaking? I'm breathtaking?
CAROL And he's very particular. Ben, you're staying tonight, right?
BEN Sure.
JERRY Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station.
ELAINE Yeah, see ya.
JERRY Okay.
CAROL Oh, just look at him!
BEN Yeah, he really is breathtaking.
RACHEL Train was so crowded. I had to sit in the seat facing the wrong way.
JERRY Oh I like that. It's like going back in time.
GEORGE Hey Rachel!
RACHEL Hi. I'm gonna go in there to change.
GEORGE What kind of a greeting was that?
JERRY She's got greeting problems.
GEORGE Yeah. I love Hampton tomatoes. You know, you can eat 'em like apples. You know it's funny, the tomato never took on as a hand fruit.
JERRY Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup and the sauce, but you can't find a good one.
KRAMER Hey, hey, hey! Look at what I got!
GEORGE Hey! Wow, the K-Man!
JERRY You got lobster for everybody?
KRAMER Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean.
GEORGE This is fantastic. Man, what a weekend. Swimming, lobster for dinner...
KRAMER I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless.
GEORGE You saw who, what?
KRAMER Yeah, I saw Jane topless. Well, we all saw her.
JERRY All right.
GEORGE You saw Jane topless?
JERRY Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless.
GEORGE Oh you mean face down on her chest.
JERRY No.
GEORGE Face up on her back?
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE Well why'd she do that?
KRAMER I guess she was hot.
GEORGE You mean she just laid there topless?
KRAMER No, no, she got up, walked around...
GEORGE Walked around? And you looked?
KRAMER Of course. She's got a great body, buddy. All right, I'm gonna go upstairs, I'll be right back.
GEORGE I can't believe it, you saw her before me.
JERRY Think of me as a doctor.
GEORGE Well, how good a look did you get?
JERRY Well what'd you mean?
GEORGE Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist...
JERRY They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.
GEORGE Great, great. So anytime you want you can just visualize her naked.
JERRY I guess that's true...
GEORGE Stop it, stop it! It's not fair. It's not fair. I don't like this situation, Jerry. I don't like it one bit.
JERRY What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?
GEORGE Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime.
JERRY You can see me naked. I can offer you that.
GEORGE It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang and you jump out first.
ELAINE Nobody ever called me breathtaking before.
JERRY I've never been called breathtaking either.
ELAINE I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not breathtaking?
JERRY Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.
ELAINE Yeah, right, that's a possibility. I have to find out.
JERRY How are you gonna do that?
ELAINE I can be very clever.
RACHEL I'm gonna take a swim.
ELAINE Oh, me too. I'll meet you down. Oh, don't go in, Rachel's getting undressed.
GEORGE Oh, okay.
RACHEL Hey!
GEORGE Oh, sorry.
RACHEL Don't you knock?
GEORGE I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've never seen before.
JERRY You might have.
GEORGE I didn't.
JERRY You won't.
RACHEL What'd you want anyway, George?
JERRY Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you want?
GEORGE No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum.
JERRY Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some gum.
GEORGE Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up.
RACHEL We don't have any gum.
GEORGE Okay. Thanks anyway.
RACHEL Strange man.
JERRY Wait'll you get to know him.
RACHEL So where is this baby, anyway?
JERRY Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so objectionable. It's down the hall, third door on your left.
RACHEL Oh my God! I'm sorry, I thought this was the baby's room. I'm really sorry.
GEORGE I was in the pool! I was in the pool!
GEORGE Did she do it on purpose?
JERRY It was my fault, I told her the wrong door.
GEORGE I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me.
JERRY So what?
GEORGE Well ordinarily I wouldn't mind. But...
JERRY But...
GEORGE Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was cold...
JERRY Oh... You mean... shrinkage.
GEORGE Yes. Significant shrinkage!
JERRY So you feel you were short changed.
GEORGE Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete misapprehension. That was not me, Jerry. That was not me.
JERRY Well, so what's the difference?
GEORGE What if she discusses it with Jane?
JERRY Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane.
GEORGE How do you know?
JERRY Women aren't like us.
GEORGE They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about everything! Couldn't you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor?
JERRY No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think women know about shrinkage.
GEORGE How do women know about shrinkage? Elaine! Get! Do women know about shrinkage?
ELAINE What do you mean, like laundry?
GEORGE No.
JERRY Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards...
ELAINE It shrinks?
JERRY Like a frightened turtle!
ELAINE Why does it shrink?
GEORGE It just does.
ELAINE I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.
MICHAEL Thanks for the lobster, Kramer.
KRAMER Rachel, aren't you gonna have any?
RACHEL Oh, no, I can't. I'm kosher, we don't eat shellfish.
KRAMER You mean you've never tasted lobster?
RACHEL No.
KRAMER Wow. You're so pious. I really respect that. You know when you die, you're gonna get some special attention.
CAROL Oh, the baby's crying. I'll go get him. He can sit with us.
ELAINE_AND_JERRY No!
JERRY No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable.
ELAINE Yeah, finish eating. The baby's not gonna have any fun over here. We're not fun for a baby.
JERRY Yeah, the lobster'll scare him.
CAROL I'm gonna get him.
GEORGE See, look at this. Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to be much bigger, and now it shrunk. You see, that's what water does. It shrinks things.
ELAINE Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science.
GEORGE What're you doing? What're you, telling secrets? What're you laughing at?
JANE It's nothing, George.
GEORGE You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking about me?
JANE What is it with you?
JERRY Easy big fella.
MICHAEL So Kramer, where'd you get all these lobster, at the Fleesher's Market?
KRAMER No, I got 'em in the ocean.
MICHAEL The ocean? What'd you mean?
KRAMER Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all these lobsters came up.
MICHAEL Those are commercial lobster traps. You can't take those lobsters from there. That's against the law.
KRAMER Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for everyone.
MICHAEL My father was a lobsterman. He got up every morning at four and came home every night stinking of brine. He sent me through law school with the lobsters he caught!
CAROL Here he is.
KRAMER Ahhh!
ELAINE Some night, huh?
BEN Yeah, I wish I had my telescope.
ELAINE Some dinner, huh?
BEN Nothing like fresh caught lobster.
ELAINE Some house, huh?
BEN It was built by Mark Farman.
ELAINE Some ugly baby, huh?
BEN What did you say?
ELAINE I said, uh, some snuggly baby.
BEN He is something.
ELAINE Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised to hear you use a word like breathtaking to describe a baby, I mean, because you also used it referring to me.
BEN Well, you know Elaine, sometimes you say things just to be nice.
JERRY You told her?
RACHEL Yeah, what's the big deal?
JERRY You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic.
RACHEL Jerry, what the difference? You know, you're the ones obsessed with this stuff, not us. I'm sure it wouldn't matter to Jane.
GEORGE You're going back to New York now?
JANE Yeah, I have some things to do.
GEORGE Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend Rachel, that's what I think.
JANE So what if I did?
GEORGE And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?
JANE I don't know what you're talking about.
GEORGE I think that you think that a certain something is not all that it could be, when in fact it is is all that it should be, and more!
JANE I'm sure it is.
GEORGE Look, you don't understand. There was shrinkage. fridge and Kramer lights up a cigar.
KRAMER Looking for this?
RACHEL Oh, Kramer! You startled me.
KRAMER Well, I thought you might wind up around here.
RACHEL Yeah, well, I couldn't stop thinking about how everyone was enjoying the lobster so much. I thought I little taste wouldn't hurt, huh?
KRAMER I'm afraid I couldn't do that.
RACHEL Why not?
KRAMER Well, that wouldn't be kosher.
RACHEL C'mon, Kramer. I really want to try it.
KRAMER Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch.
RACHEL Come on, Kramer.
KRAMER Heyahhh!
RACHEL I just heard a car drive out. What was that?
JERRY Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle of the night.
CAROL George, thanks so much for making breakfast.
ELAINE George, these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever tasted.
KRAMER I didn't know you could cook.
GEORGE Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host.
BEN Yes, George, the whole breakfast is breathtaking.
RACHEL Good morning.
ALL Hey, hey.
RACHEL Kramer, I just want to thank you again for last night, you really saved me.
MICHAEL What happened?
RACHEL Well, I almost tried the lobster, but Kramer stopped me.
KRAMER You'd regret it for the rest of your life.
RACHEL You're right, I would have.
JERRY Hey, look at this guy.
GEORGE A little breakfast.
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE And, uh, you eat eggs, right?
RACHEL Yes, I do, thanks.
JERRY Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs like this?
RACHEL Umm... This is so good.
GEORGE Ah, enjoying them?
RACHEL Mm-hmm.
GEORGE Uh, good. You know, you might wanna try eating it with one of these.
RACHEL There's lobster in these eggs?
GEORGE Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water.
JERRY Well, I guess I gotta go, too.
ELAINE Well, this has turned out to be one helluva weekend.
MICHAEL Excuse me?
POLICE I'm sorry to bother you, but we're trying to track down a lobster poacher that cleaned out on of the traps.
KRAMER Wonder what's goin' on.
GEORGE Ah, I guess I should go up and apologize.
MICHAEL There he is, officer.
RACHEL Ahh! Don't you ever knock?
GEORGE I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael to town.
ELAINE Hey, if you saw me naked, I wouldn't want to ride back in the same car with you either.
JERRY I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.
ELAINE How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine?
JERRY They got some sort of program. officer. Back to the car.
GEORGE Hey, there's a tomato stand, let's stop, I can get some more.
JERRY Hey, isn't that Michael's car?
ELAINE There's Rachel.
GEORGE Where?
ELAINE Hey, good news. My dog problem has been solved.
JERRY Really? What happened?
ELAINE Well, there's this rabbi in my building. You've met him. Very nice man.
JERRY Isn't he the one with the show on cable?
ELAINE Yea, yeah, yeah,. So I spoke to him about the dog. He went down. Talked to the owner. She agr4eed to keep the dog inside from now on.
JERRY That's great.
ELAINE I know.
JERRY That looks pretty good.
ELAINE He's in.
JERRY Hey, say, you know, we haven't even discussed George's engagement yet.
ELAINE What's to discuss?
JERRY Come on! George: is getting married!
ELAINE Is he happy? to sit with his bride-to-be.
GEORGE I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor?
SUSAN Well, maybe it's so you can see if there's someone in there.
GEORGE Isn't that why we have locks on the doors?
SUSAN Well, as a backup system, in case the lock is broken, you can see if it's taken.
GEORGE A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. That's a complete breakdown of the system.
SUSAN Can we change the subject, please?
GEORGE Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject?
SUSAN No, fine. If you wanna keep talking about it, we'll talk about it.
GEORGE It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum.
SUSAN Well, I didn't think that it had any momentum.
GEORGE How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. We don't even share the same interests.
JERRY Yeah, he seems pretty happy.
ELAINE Well, that's all that counts, I guess.
JERRY What's the matter?
ELAINE Oh, nothin'.
JERRY Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing.
ELAINE Well, what do you want me to do?
JERRY Well, at least have some reaction to it.
ELAINE Well, I don't.
JERRY Maybe you're a little jealous.
ELAINE Oh, what? You think I wanna marry George:?
JERRY No! But maybe you wish it was you who was getting married, not him.
ELAINE Oh, please! That is the last thing that I want.
JERRY Oh, yeah. Right.
ELAINE Yeah, right.
JERRY Lainy!
ELAINE Jerry:!
JERRY You don't wanna get married?
ELAINE Yeah, that's right. I don't wanna get married.
JERRY Oh, come on!
ELAINE Oh, you come on.
JERRY You're such...
KRAMER Oh, hey!
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER Elaine:, listen, I was talking to a friend about this dog business. Do you realize this is gonna be on our permanent records? Are you aware of this?
ELAINE Oh, dear.
KRAMER It can never be erased. It'll follow us wherever we go for the rest of our lives. I'll never be able to get a job. I mean, doesn't that concern you? Everything I've worked for...down the drain because of one stupid mistake. I mean, aren't we entitled to make one mistake in our lives, Jerry:?
JERRY We're gonna change the system.
KRAMER Yes!
ELAINE Well, I could care less. I hope it is on our record. I'm just sorry they didn't lock me up.
ELAINE Oh, hello, Rabbi: Krischma.
RABBI Elaine:! Always a pleasure to see you.
ELAINE Thanks again for taking care of that dog for us.
RABBI Elaine, often times in life there are problems, and just as often there are solutions.
ELAINE Yeah, I suppose.
RABBI Elaine, you don't seem yourself today. You seem, if I may say, troubled.
ELAINE No, Rabbi:, I'm not myself.
RABBI Come upstairs. We'll have a talk.
JERRY Hey!
GEORGE I want your honest opinion about something.
JERRY Have I ever been less than forthright?
GEORGE No, you haven't. Well, maybe you have. What do I know.
JERRY Yeah, I probably have. Yeah, of course I have. What am I talking about?
GEORGE All right. Okay, tell me what you think about this idea: Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium all the way to the floor.
JERRY Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium to the floor ...door comes down. Hides your feet. Yes. I like it. I like it a lot.
GEORGE It's good, right?
JERRY I think it's fantastic. I think it's a fantastic idea.
GEORGE You do?
JERRY Yes, I do.
GEORGE Well, I told it to Susan: before, and she didn't like it.
JERRY Hmm.
GEORGE Yeah. Not only that, this is what she said to me, "Can we change the subject?"
JERRY See, now that I don't care for.
GEORGE Right. I mean, we're on a subject. Why does it have to be changed?
JERRY It should resolve of its own volition.
GEORGE That's exactly what I said, except I used the word "momentum".
JERRY Momentum - same thing.
GEORGE Same thing. My god, I'm getting married in December, do you know that?
JERRY Yeah, I know.
GEORGE Well, I don't see how I'm gonna make December. I mean, I need a little more time. I mean, look at me I'm a nervous wreck. My stomach aches. My neck is killing me. I can't turn. Look. Look.
JERRY You're turning.
GEORGE Nah, it's not a good turn. December. December. Don't you think we should have a little more time just to get to know each other a little.
JERRY If you need more time, you should have more time.
GEORGE What, you think I could postpone it?
JERRY Sure you can. Why not?
GEORGE That's allowed? You're allowed to postpone it?
JERRY I don't see why not.
GEORGE So, I could do that?
JERRY Sure, go ahead.
GEORGE All right! All right. I'll tell you what. How about this? Got the date; March 21st, the first day of spring.
JERRY Spring. Of course.
GEORGE Huh? You know? Spring. Rejuvenation. Rebirth. Everything's blooming. All that crap.
JERRY Beautiful.
GEORGE She's not gonna like it.
JERRY No, she's not.
GEORGE You know, I think I'm a little bit scared of her. She's five-three, like a hundred pounds. I'm frightened to death of her.
JERRY Well, she's a woman. They don't like to be disappointed.
GEORGE Especially her. She does not like disappointment. Well, I have to do it. I can't make December. There's no way I can make December. Right? I mean, you can see that, right? I mean, look at me. Look. Look. Can I make December? I can't make December. Right? Look. Look.
JERRY Yeah, you'd better shoot for March.
KRAMER Hey, hey.
GEORGE March 21st. Hey! So, you're gonna back me on this, right?
JERRY Oh, all the way.
GEORGE You are a good friend. You know what? Even if you killed somebody I wouldn't turn you in.
JERRY Is that so?
JERRY Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in?
KRAMER Definitely.
JERRY You're kidding?
KRAMER No, no, I would turn you in.
JERRY You would turn me in?
KRAMER Phwap, I wouldn't even think about it.
JERRY I can't believe your a friend of mine.
KRAMER What kind of person are you going around killing people?
JERRY Well, I am sure I had a good reason.
KRAMER Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be next?
JERRY But you know me!
KRAMER I thought I DID!
ELAINE I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need of some guidance here.
RABBI Would you care for a snack of some kind? I have the Snackwells which are very popular but I think that sometimes with the so called fat free cookies people may overindulge forgetting they may be high in calories
ELAINE Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway, um, this friend of mine, George, got engaged .
RABBI How wonderful.
ELAINE Yeah, yeah, well, for some reason, um, I just find myself just overcome with feelings of jealousy and resentment.
RABBI Doesn't it give you any joy to see your friend enter into this holiest of unions?
ELAINE No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole think makes me . . sick.
RABBI You know, Elaine, very often we cannot see the forest for the trees.
ELAINE Yeah, I don't know what that means.
RABBI Well, for example, say there's a forest, . . .
ELAINE You see the thing is we It should have been me. You know, I'm smart. I'm attractive.
RABBI You know my temple has many single functions.
ELAINE No, no, it's okay.
RABBI My nephew Alex is someone who is also looking perhaps ...
ELAINE I don't think so.
RABBI He owns a flower store. Very successful.
JERRY So you're nothing but a stoolie. Admit it.
KRAMER Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
JERRY Another Caf� Latte?
KRAMER You better believe it.
KRAMER Since when are you so trendy?
JERRY Hey, baby. I set the trends. Who do you think started this whole Caf� Latte?
JERRY I don't recall you drinking Caf� Latte.
KRAMER I've been drinking Caf� Latte since the fifth grade and I haven't looked back.
JERRY Hey, Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night. One show only.
KRAMER I've always wanted to see this.
JERRY You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying to get a table and I missed it.
KRAMER Well, yeah, lets do it uh?
JERRY Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering.
JERRY Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.
KRAMER Maybe I will.
GEORGE Hi,
SUSAN How was your day?
GEORGE Good, good day. How was your day?
SUSAN Mine was okay. So what's goin' on?
GEORGE Oh, nothin' much. I went over to jerry's, uh, talked to Jerry.
SUSAN Oh, the Lowers want to get together with us on Friday night.
GEORGE The Lowers, really?
SUSAN You don't want to go?
GEORGE No, I want to go.
SUSAN So what did Jerry have to say?
GEORGE Oh, nothin' much, . . . talkin'. . . . Oh, oh, oh, did I have an unbelievable idea today!
SUSAN Oh, yeah, the toilets. You told me.
GEORGE Yeah, ha ha, It's not the toilets, it's not the toilets. It's something else. Are you ready for this?
SUSAN Yeah.
GEORGE Okay, how about this? All right, we get married March 21st, the first day of Spring.
SUSAN What do you mean? You want to postpone the wedding?
GEORGE No, no no it's not about postponing. I just think the first day of Spring is the perfect day to get married. You know, Spring! Rejuvenation! Rebirth! Everything is blooming all the ...
SUSAN If you don't want to marry me, George, just say so. Say so.
GEORGE Still marry , still marry.
SUSAN You don't love me.
GEORGE Sstill love. Still love.
SUSAN My parents told me you were too neurotic and that I was making a mistake.
GEORGE No no no, no mistake, no mistake. No, no , listen, we're going to get married over Christmas, I ...It doesn't make any difference to me. It's fine. Really.
SUSAN Are you sure?
GEORGE Yeah, yeah, sure, Christmas. Snow. Santa. All that stuff.
JERRY Let me take a guess. She cried and you caved.
GEORGE How did you know that?
JERRY I live and breath my friend. . . . I live and breath.
GEORGE I got to tell you I felt terrible. I really thought she was going to collapse and kill herself.
JERRY tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity.
GEORGE You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do. It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out.
JERRY Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up sex after.
GEORGE I didn't have any sex.
JERRY You didn't have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex? I mean that's the best feature of the heavy relationship.
GEORGE I didn't have make-up sex.
JERRY In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit.
GEORGE Yeah, conjugal visit sex. That is happening!
WOMAN 
MAN I can tell you're very upset but I'm sorry I'm not goin'
GEORGE Did you here that? I can't believe this he's eating his sandwich.
MAN Are you going to eat thoise fries?
GEORGE This is amazing. Thank you. Thank you very much. . . . I'm going back in! . . . You'll feel better
JERRY . . . Poor bastard.
JERRY Good evening, Rabbi.
RABBI Good evening. And how does this evening find you?
JERRY Well, Rabbi, well.
RABBI I trust you are here to see your friend, Elaine.
JERRY Yeah, that's right.
RABBI I hope she's feeling better.
JERRY What do you mean?
RABBI She didn't tell you?
JERRY No.
RABBI Well it seems the engagement of her ffriend George has left her feeling bitter and hostile.
JERRY is that so?
RABBI Yes, in fact she told me that she wishes she was the one getting married.
JERRY Really?
RABBI She came off as pretty desperate.
JERRY I didn't know any of this.
RABBI Apparently she doesn't think much of this George fellow either. I recall the word loser peppered throughout her conversation.
JERRY Hum, well it all comes as news to me. G Hi.
SUSAN Hi, how was your day?
GEORGE Good, good day. How was your day?
SUSAN Ah, it was okay. What's going on?
GEORGE Oh, nothing much. You know, I went over to Jerry's. Talked to Jerry. Um, could I talk to you for a minute?
SUSAN Yeah, sure.
GEORGE You see this is the thing. . . . I just feel . . . mumble, cry, mumble, . . . I'm scared. You and I together,
SUSAN George, of course, of course it can wait until march if that is what you want.
GEORGE Yeah?
SUSAN Oh, don't worry your head. Of course.
GEORGE All right.
ELAINE I've got that magazine article for you.
JERRY You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside.
ELAINE Are you
JERRY Understand you had a little talk with him too.
ELAINE Yeah, talked earlier.
JERRY Yes I know, I know.
ELAINE . . . What does that mean?
JERRY Nothing, nothing.
ELAINE He didn't mention . . .
JERRY Yes he did.
ELAINE He told you about our conversation?
JERRY We had quite a little chat.
ELAINE He told you about . . .
JERRY Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him.
ELAINE He told you all that? How could he?
JERRY It didn't take much prodding either, I must say.
ELAINE Can he do that?
JERRY He did it.
ELAINE But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth?
JERRY That's what's so fascinating.
JERRY You better finish your little caf� latte there. They won't let you in with it.
KRAMER Why not?
JERRY Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.
KRAMER Well that's stupid
JERRY That's the rule.
KRAMER Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that.
RABBI Oh, Elaine. Come in. Come in. So nice to see you again. E Yeah...
RABBI Can I offere you some Kasha Varnishkas?
ELAINE No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about?
RABBI Was that a problem for you?
ELAINE Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didn't, you didn't tell anyone else about this, did you?
RABBI Well, let's see? I seem to recall a conversation with Mrs. Winston in 1F.
ELAINE Mrs. Winston?
RABBI Yes, we were waiting for our mail to arrive and I happened to mention to her how you felt that it was never going "to happen" for you.
ELAINE What about Don Ramsey? You didn't mention anything to him did you?
RABBI Don Ramsey?
ELAINE You know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth floor.
RABBI Oh him! Well this morning I found myself in the elevator with him...
ELAINE my god, you didn't.
JERRY Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me
KRAMER Oh, yow, oow Ah!
USHER Hey, hey, what's going on? What just happened here?
KRAMER Nothing Nothing.
USHER Whatya got? One of those Caf� Latte's in your shirt?
KRAMER I don't have anything. Ask him.
USHER All right, come on Coffee Boy, bring it out.
KRAMER What?!
USHER Here you go.
KRAMER Ow
ELAINE But the whole thing is a mess. He told everyone in the building. I met that cute guy on the fifth floor. I mean he could barely bring himself to nod.
JERRY Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves.
ELAINE You didn't say this to George, did you?
JERRY No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married instead of him? Feelings of resentment, hostility?
ELAINE Yeah that! So, . . .
GEORGE Hey oh.
ELAINE GEORGIE! CONGRATULATIONS! Oh, my god. I haven't seen you since it happened. I'm so happy for you.
GEORGE Alright, thanks a lot.
ELAINE Oh, come on. You really, really deserve it.
GEORGE Oh, deserve! I don't know if I deserve...I mean...
ELAINE Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured.
GEORGE Well, I guess I'm getting older.
ELAINE Oh! Well, I just think it's wonderful. Honestly! I've gotta run, but um, please, please give my best to Susan. George Yeah. Elaine My most, just heartfelt congratulations.
GEORGE Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four of us could go out together sometime.
ELAINE Yes! Yes, yes. Sure.
GEORGE Wait, as a matter of fact, wasn't there some guy in your building that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something.
ELAINE Yes. Yes, yes. Yes.
GEORGE Yeah! Boy, she is something, isn't she?
JERRY Yeah, she's something else. Hey, so what happened? Did you hold your ground or...uh...
GEORGE Nope. I wept like a baby.
JERRY What?
GEORGE Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, I just burst into tears.
JERRY You cried?
GEORGE I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to.
JERRY Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around.
KRAMER Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions.
JERRY Suing? What for?
KRAMER The coffee was too hot.
JERRY It's supposed to be hot.
KRAMER Not THAT hot.
RABBI The prophet Isaah tells us without friends our lives are empty and meaningless.
GEORGE Wait. Whoa! That's the Rabbi: from Elaine's building. I just met this guy the other day.
RABBI A young lady I know, let's call her Elaine, happened to find herself overwhelmed with feelings of resentment and hostility for her friend, let's call him George:. She felt that George was somewhat of a loser and that she was the one who deserved to be married first. She also happened to mention to me that her friend had wondered if going to a prostitute while you're engaged is considered cheating. His feeling was they're never going to see each other again so what's the difference. But that is a subject for another sermon. Now, I'd like to close with a psalm.
WOMAN Well I started out working in mortgage bonds, but I just found that so limiting.
JERRY My friend Kramer and I were discussing that same thing the other day. He was with Brant-Leland for a while.
WOMAN Wow. Well then my mentor suggested that I move into equities, best move I ever made.
JERRY Mentor? You mean your boss.
WOMAN Oh, no no no, Cynthia's just a successful businesswoman who's taken me under her wing.
JERRY Hmm. So Cynthia's your mentor.
WOMAN And I'm her protoge. You must have someone like that. You know, who guides you in your career path.
JERRY Well, I like Gabe Kaplan.
GEORGE I still don't understand this. Abby has a mentor?
JERRY Yes. And the mentor advises the protoge.
GEORGE Is there any money involved?
JERRY No.
GEORGE So what's in it for the mentor?
JERRY Respect, admiration, prestige.
GEORGE Pssh. Would the protoge pick up stuff for the mentor?
JERRY I suppose if it was on the protoge's way to the mentor, they might.
GEORGE Laundry? Dry cleaning?
JERRY It's not a valet, it's a protoge.
GEORGE Alright. Listen, I gotta get some reading done. You mind if I do this here? I can't concentrate in my apartment.
JERRY Risk management?
GEORGE Yeah. Steinbrenner wants everyone in the front office to give a lecture in their area of business expertise.
JERRY Well what makes them think you're a risk management expert?
GEORGE I guess it's on my resume.
JERRY Hello?
VOICE Please hold for Elaine Benes.
GEORGE You know what? I can't do this. I can't read books anymore; books on tape have ruined me, Jerry. I need that nice voice. This book has my voice. I hate my voice.
JERRY So get this book on tape.
GEORGE You can't, it's a textbook.
ELAINE Hey, Jer. Are you going to this Bob Sacamano party?
JERRY Am I going? It was three nights ago.
ELAINE What? You're kidding, I just got this invitation today. Oh, I was so excited. It's really a beautiful invitation.
JERRY Oh, it was a lovely affair.
ELAINE Wait a minute; this postmark is three weeks old. Man, this happens all the time. Jeanine? Who the hell runs the mailroom?
JEANINE Eddie Sherman.
ELAINE Alright, send him up here.
JERRY You gonna do a little yelling?
ELAINE I'm gonna do a little firing.
JERRY That is so cool, can you put me on the speaker?
ELAINE Oh yeah, sure. Gimme a break.
JERRY Hey, Copernicus?
JEANINE Eddie Sherman is here.
ELAINE Oh, great. Send him in.
EDDIE You wanted to see me?
ELAINE Eddie. Yes, um, I am so sorry but I'm afraid we're gonna have to... promote you.
JERRY So, what did you say?
ELAINE Well, I called him all the way up to my office, so I had to tell him something important. So I promoted him.
JERRY What? What did you--
ELAINE Copywriter.
JERRY He's writing copy?
ELAINE Well it can't be any worse than the pointless drivel we normally churn out.
KRAMER Yowza yowza. Check it out.
JERRY Jewish singles night?
KRAMER I expect you both to be there.
ELAINE I'm not Jewish.
KRAMER Well neither am I.
JERRY Well why are you going?
KRAMER I'm not, I'm running it.
JERRY What are you talking about?
KRAMER Well Lomez, he usually runs it but he's in the Everglades.
JERRY Lomez is Jewish?
KRAMER Oh yeah yeah yeah. Orthodox, Jerry. Old school.
ELAINE At the Knights of Columbus?
KRAMER Yeah, Frank Costanza, he's getting me a room at his lodge. So Jerry, you know I'm really counting on you to come to this.
JERRY Kramer, you know, I--
KRAMER No, Jerry, look I'm cooking all the food myself.
ELAINE A tempting schmear of authentic Jewish delicacies.
KRAMER Do you like tsimmis?
ABBY My mentor says the duck is outstanding here.
JERRY I'm not really a duck fan, the skin seems sort of human.
ABBY Oh! Look who's here, Cynthia!
CYNTHIA Hello, Abby.
ABBY Hello. Jerry, this is Cynthia Pearlman, my mentor.
JERRY Hello.
CYNTHIA Hi Jerry, nice to finally meet you.
ABBY Well come join us, we could pull up a chair.
CYNTHIA Great, my boyfriend's just parking the car. Actually, Jerry, you night know him, he's a comic too.
JERRY No kidding?
CYNTHIA Kenny Banya.
JERRY Banya? Banya enters.
BANYA Hey, Jerry!! How's it going?! You gonna join us for dinner? The duck here's the best. The best, Jerry.
GEORGE Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, I noticed that you have a textbook on tape. May I ask where you got that?
MAN Reading for the Blind. They can get any book on tape.
GEORGE I tell ya, I am hooked on these books on tape.
MAN Oh, tell me about it. These things have ruined me for Braille.
JERRY Reading for the Blind?
GEORGE I take an eye test; I flunk it, the next thing you know I am swinging to the sweet sounds of risk management.
JERRY So, I finally met the mentor.
GEORGE What's she like? Impressive?
JERRY Oh yeah, she's dating Banya.
GEORGE Banya?
JERRY Yeah. I had to spend two hours at dinner last night with that specimen.
GEORGE What did you have?
JERRY Chicken, how could she look up to a person who voluntarily spends time with Banya?
GEORGE Marsala?
JERRY Piccata, if anything I should be dating a mentor and Banya should be setting pins in a bowling alley.
GEORGE Alright, I got a test to fail.
JERRY Hey, good luck with that.
GEORGE Thank you.
GEORGE Dad.
FRANK What are you wearing, an athletic sweat suit?
GEORGE What are you doing here?
KRAMER Well, he came by to pick up his check for the banquet hall. You know I got a hundred and eighty-three responses? Oh, it's gonna be a rager.
JERRY Kramer, how are you gonna cook Jewish delicacies for a hundred and eighty-three people?
KRAMER Yeah, you're right. That's a lot of pupkitz. Hey Frank, you know anybody who can help me cook?
FRANK Cook? No, I don't know any cooks. I don't know anything about cooking!
KRAMER What's the matter with him?
GEORGE My dad was a cook during the Korean War. Something very bad happened, ever since you can't get him near a kitchen.
KRAMER Shell-shocked?
GEORGE Oh yeah, but that has nothing to do with it.
ELAINE That's good work, guys. That aught to do it for today.
EDDIE Wait. You didn't ask me about my ideas.
ELAINE Oh, Eddie, well it's your first day.
EDDIE I'm ready.
ELAINE Oh, okay.
EDDIE It's a hot night. The mind races. You think about your knife; the only friend who hasn't betrayed you, the only friend who won't be dead by sun up. Sleep tight, mates, in your quilted Chambray nightshirts.
ELAINE What am I gonna do? He is a disaster.
JERRY Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe he's in line for another promotion.
ELAINE You know what? You are exactly right. That is what I should do, I should promote him. I'll give him another office on another floor and he can sit there with his nice title and his bayonet and stop freakin' me out.
GEORGE Nothing at all.
DOCTOR Well George, your vision is quite impaired. If you'll just sign this insurance form, here's a pen.
GEORGE You're a very handsome man, by the way.
JERRY What the hell is going on here?
JERRY What are you doing?
KRAMER I got three kitchens going. I got brisket going at Newman's, I got kugel working at Mrs. Zamfino's, this is kreplach. Here, try some of this.
JERRY No, I don't want to.
KRAMER Eat, eat! You're skin and bones. Jerry gabs a fork and tastes a piece.
KRAMER Hah?
JERRY Oh, this is awful.
KRAMER Jerry, it's kreplach. It's an acquired taste, yeah.
JERRY Did you follow the recipe?
KRAMER The recipe was for four to six people; I had to multiply for a hundred and eighty-three people. I guess I got confused.
JERRY It tastes like dirt.
KRAMER Well I also dropped it on the way over. Look I'm in trouble, I got no skills. I can't peel, I can't chop, I can't grate. I can't mince! I got no sense of flavor, obviously. You know, I gotta talk to Frank.
JERRY Kramer, you can't talk to Frank.
KRAMER No I gotta talk to him, I know that he can help me, Jerry.
ABBY I think there's a dead animal in the elevator.
KRAMER My stuffed cabbage!
ABBY So, great dinner last night.
JERRY Yeah, it was alright.
ABBY I told Cynthia we'd double with her and Banya Saturday and then catch his act.
JERRY No. No, no way, no Banya.
ABBY What?
JERRY Have you seen his act? He's got a twelve-minute bit about Ovaltine. He's a punk, a patsy, a hack.
ABBY Cynthia would not date a hack.
JERRY Would. Does. Is.
ELAINE Before we get started, I am happy to tell you that Eddie Sherman is no longer writing for this catalog.
ELAINE He's upstairs, I made him Director of Corporate Development.
EMPLOYEE You promoted him?
ELAINE Well, no, I would hardly--
EMPLOYEE I bust my hump ever day.
ELAINE Relax--
EMPLOYEE As far as I'm concerned, you and your deranged protoge can run the catalog by yourselves! I quit!
ELAINE Well, hey? Hey. Hey!!
VOICE Chapter one. In order to manage risk we must first understand risk. How do you spot risk? How do you avoid risk and what makes it so risky?
GEORGE This guy sounds just like me.
VOICE To understand risk, we must first define risk.
GEORGE This is horrible.
VOICE Risk is defined as--
GEORGE Stop it! Stop it!
KRAMER C'mon Frank, I need you. I mean the war was fifty years ago.
FRANK In my mind, there's a war still going on.
KRAMER Alright, what happened, Frank? What is it that you can't get over?
FRANK Incheon, Korea, 1950. I was the best cook Uncle Sam ever saw, slinging hash for the Fighting 103rd. As we marched north, our supply lines were getting thin. One day a couple of GIs found a crate, inside were six hundred pounds of prime Texas steer. At least it once was prime. The Use date was three weeks past, but I was arrogant, I was brash, I thought if I used just the right spices, cooked it long enough...
KRAMER What happened?
FRANK I went too far. I over seasoned it. Men were keeling over all around me. I can still hear the retching, the screaming. I sent sixteen of my own men to the latrines that night. They were just boys.
KRAMER Frank, you were a boy too. And it was war. It was a crazy time for everyone.
FRANK Tell that to Bobby Colby. All that kid wanted to do was go home. Well he went home alright, with a crater in his colon the size of a cutlet. Had to sit him on a cork the eighteen-hour flight home!
KRAMER Frank, now listen to me. Two hundred Jewish singles need you. This is your chance to make it all right again.
FRANK No. No, I'll never cook again! Never! Now get out of my house!! Get out. Go.
JERRY So you saw Banya's act?
ABBY He got two minutes into that Ovaltine thing and I just couldn't take it anymore.
JERRY I told you, it's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges.
ABBY Why is he so obsessed with Ovaltine?
JERRY He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny.
ABBY Anyway, Cynthia and I got into this big argument afterwards and I think it's over.
JERRY No more mentor?
ABBY Looks that way.
JERRY Well at least you and I are okay again.
ABBY Actually I was kind of thinking that maybe we shouldn't see each other for a while.
JERRY Why?
ABBY Well I'm feeling a little disoriented. It's just weird for me not to have an advisor.
JERRY I can tell you what to do.
ABBY No, it's more than that.
JERRY I can tell you what to think.
ABBY I need someone I can trust.
JERRY Oh.
GEORGE I got a big problem here, Jerry. The tapes are worthless.
JERRY Kind of in the middle of something here, George.
JERRY George?
ABBY I gotta run anyway.
JERRY I can't believe you feel you really need a mentor.
ABBY I just need someone who can give me some kind of direction. I'll see ya.
JERRY Yeah, see ya.
JERRY What's your problem.
GEORGE No problem.
EDDIE Hey, I think I got something here. The Bengalese Galoshes.
ELAINE Oh.
EDDIE It's tough keeping your feet dry when you're kicking in a skull.
ELAINE You know, Eddie, that might be just a tad harsh for womenswear.
EDDIE Well, I'm not married to it. Elaine. Oh. Well, um, in that case why don't we take the phrase, "kicking in a skull" and we tweak it, you know, just a hair, to something like, what, like "strolling through a dewy meadow"?
EDDIE Dewy meadow.
ESTELLE Here's your omelet.
FRANK It's dry.
ESTELLE That's the way I always make it.
FRANK Well it sucks.
ESTELLE What did you say?
FRANK Your meatloaf is mushy, your salmon croquettes are oily and your eggplant parmesan is a disgrace to this house!
ESTELLE Well that's too bad, because I'm the only one who cooks around here!
FRANK Not any more! Gimme that spatula! I'm back, baby!
ABBY And you're sure with your busy schedule you'd have time to take on a protoge?
GEORGE I'll make time, because Abby, I was once like you; wide-eyed, naive, I didn't know the first thing about a subject as fundamental as risk management.
ABBY I'm not familiar with that, you'll have to explain it to me.
GEORGE I'll tell you what, why don't you read this book and let's just see if you can explain it to me.
ABBY Alright.
GEORGE Okay.
BANYA Hey Jerry.
JERRY Oh, hey Banya.
BANYA Didja hear what happened? The mentor saw my act. She dumped me.
JERRY Oh, that's too bad.
BANYA Maybe she's right. Maybe I am a complete hack. I'm the absolute worst. The worst, Jerry.
JERRY Well it's just that you got so many things with the milk. You got that Bosco bit then you got your Nestle's Quik bit, by the time you get to Ovaltine--
BANYA You think you can give me a hand with my material?
KRAMER Hey.
FRANK You still need a cook?
KRAMER Oh yeah, come on in, Frank.
FRANK Ya got T-Fal?
KRAMER Keflon.
FRANK No! Follow me.
BANYA Why do they call it Ovaltine? The mug is round. The jar is round. They should call it round tine. That's gold, Jerry! Gold!
ELAINE Let's just replace "hail of shrapnel" and "scar tissue" with "string of pearls" and "raspberry scones".
JERRY George Costanza is your mentor?
ABBY Yeah, he's great! I am learning so much.
JERRY About what? How to calculate five percent of a restaurant check?
ABBY You know what your problem is? You just have no respect for the mentor/mentor relationship.
JERRY As a matter of fact, I happen to have a protoge of my own.
ABBY Who?
JERRY A Mister Kenneth Banya.
ABBY Banya?
JERRY I'm gonna mentor this kid to the top.
ABBY Huh, well, I don't think I want to date a mentor whose protoge is a hack.
JERRY Well, I don't think I want to date a protoge whose mentor is a Costanza.
ELAINE I don't know how we did it, but there's some kind of chemistry between us, we turned out one hell of a catalog.
EDDIE Cool.
ELAINE Hey Ed, let me ask you something. What's with the fatigues and all the psychotic imagery? Huh?
EDDIE I don't want to talk about it.
ELAINE Come on, don't be a baby.
EDDIE I went out on a couple of dates with this woman, I thought she really liked me, and then things kind of cooled off.
ELAINE That's it?
EDDIE Well it's tough meeting somebody you like, let alone somebody Jewish.
ELAINE Mm. This food is fantastic.
JERRY Have you tried the hamentashen?
ELAINE I can't get off the kishkas.
BANYA Hey Jerry!
JERRY Banya?
BANYA I just stopped by to thank you. That risk management stuff you wrote for me? It's killer!
JERRY Risk management?
BANYA Aw, it's gold, Jerry! Gold! I got all these corporate gigs and even Cynthia took me back.
WOMAN So you went from the mailroom to the director of corporate development in two days?
EDDIE That's right.
WOMAN How much are they paying you? I'll double it.
KRAMER Ya know these latkes are going like hotcakes.
FRANK Where's the powdered sugar?
KRAMER You know Frank, you could take a break.
FRANK No breaks. I fell reborn, I'm like a Phoenix rising from Arizona.
ELAINE You're quitting?
EDDIE I can't churn out that pointless drivel any more.
ELAINE Well, you can't quit, you're all I've got. I need you!
VOICE Our next speaker is George Costanza on the subject of risk management.
GEORGE Ovaltine. Have you ever had this stuff? Why is it called Ovaltine?
GEORGE They should call it round tine. You know what I'm talking about.
WILHELM He's my protoge.
FRANK Noooo!!! Don't eat it! No good!
JERRY You know, I tell ya, I gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood. For a lot of reasons. And, I'll tell you reason number one: as an adult, if I want a cookie, I have a cookie, okay? I have three cookies or four cookies, or eleven cookies if I want. Many times I will intentionally ruin my entire appetite. Just ruin it. And then, I call my mother up right after to tell her that I did it. "Hello, Mom? yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite.. cookies." So what if you ruin.. See, because as an adult, we understand even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite coming right behind it. There's no danger in running out of appetites. I've got millions of them, I'll ruin them whenever I want!
TV_VOICE Look, Sigmund. Look in the sky. The planets are on fire. It is just as you prophesied. The planets of our solar system, incinerating. Like flaming globes, Sigmund. Like flaming globes.. Ah, ha, ha, ha..
ELAINE What do you got, a cucumber?
GEORGE Yeah, so what?
ELAINE You're bringing in an ouside cucumber?
GEORGE They refuse to put cucumber in the salad. I need cucumber.
JERRY What have I done? I can't read this! Ful-hel-mo-nen-ter-val? I got up last night, I wrote this down, I thought I had this great bit. Wait a second, wait a second.. "Fax me some halibut." Is that funny? Is that a joke?
ELAINE No. Let me see that. Don't-mess-with-Johnny."
JERRY Johnny? Johnny who? Johnny Carson? Did I insult Johnny on The Tonight Show?
ELAINE Did you mess with Johnny, Jerry?
GEORGE Let me see that.
ELAINE Hey, where's Kramer?
JERRY I don't know. That's like asking "Where's Waldo?"
GEORGE I think I'm having a heart attack.
JERRY I don't think that's it.
GEORGE I'm not kidding.
JERRY What does that mean?
ELAINE I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack.
JERRY Oh, he's having a heart attack.
GEORGE Tightness..
JERRY C'mon.
GEORGE Shortness of breath..
JERRY Oh, this is ridiculous.
GEORGE Radiating waves of pain..
JERRY I know what this is. You saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country. I saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure and not watch it.
GEORGE There was nothing else on. Oh, the left arm.. the left arm.
JERRY He saw that show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks.
GEORGE Why can't I have a heart attack? I'm allowed.
JERRY So what do you want? You want me take you to the hospital?
GEORGE Manhattan Memorial, less of a line.
JERRY I'll call an ambulance.
WAITRESS Is everything alright?
GEORGE We'll just take a check. You made a mistake on the..
ELAINE George!
MAN Ooohhh... Argghhh..
GEORGE Are.. are you okay?
MAN Ooooooohhh..
GEORGE I'm George.. George Costanza.. I've never been in the hospital a day in my life.. except when I had my tonsils out. You know, they never gave me any ice cream. I always felt that-
MAN Shut up!
JERRY Well? What do you think?
NURSE_1 "Salami, salami, bologna." Definitely.
JERRY "Salami salami bologna"?
DOCTOR Oh, your friend's fine. He didn't have a heart attack. I'll be in - in a few minutes.
JERRY What a surprise. Hey, how ya doin' buddy? You need anything? Do you want me to go out and get you a Superman comic?
GEORGE No, no thanks.
JERRY You know, I was wondering.. You know that Black Hawks jacket you have?
GEORGE Oh, sure, my Black Hawks jacket. I love my Black Hawks jacket.
JERRY Well, you know, I was thinking - if things don't exactly work out..
GEORGE Well, it wouldn't fit you. The sleeves are too short.
JERRY No, I tried it on. It fits good.
GEORGE Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all..
JERRY Well, you know..
GEORGE Well, okay.
JERRY Oh, and.. do you think it would be alright if I called Susan Davis?
GEORGE Susan Davis? Hey, wait a second..
JERRY Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you.
GEORGE I don't know.. you and Susan Davis?
JERRY You know, if your future was a little more certain..
GEORGE Okay, go ahead. Call her, get married, have babies, have a great life.. What do I care? I'm finished. It's all over for me. In fact, let's end it right now. Jerry, kill me, kill me now. I'm begging you. Let's just get it over with. Be a pal.. Just take the pillow and put it over my face.
JERRY Well, ah.. What? Kind of like this?
GEORGE What are ya doing?! Whadya, crazy?!
ELAINE Jerry!
JERRY Elaine, what are you doing here?
GEORGE Jerk off.
JERRY There's nothing wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine.
ELAINE Hi, George. How ya feeling? Is anybody getting your apartment?
GEORGE I'll tell ya, if I ever get out of here, I'm gonna change my life. I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing. Take up yoga, meditate.. I'll eat right. Calm down, lose my anger.. Hey, is anybody listening?!
DOCTOR Uh, hello. Uh, Mr. Costanza?
GEORGE Uh, yeah. You know, Doctor, I gotta tell you, I feel a lot better.
DOCTOR Well, we looked at your EKG's, ran some tests, did a complete work-up.
GEORGE Oh God, Mommy!
DOCTOR And you simply haven't had a heart attack.
GEORGE I haven't? I'm okay? I'm okay? Oh, thank you, thank you, Doctor! I don't know how to thank you.
JERRY Hey, that was really fun, George. Can we go home now?
DOCTOR No, actually, we'd like to keep him here overnight for observation, just to be safe.
GEORGE Oh, sure. Sure, anything. Can you believe it? There's nothing wrong with me.
DOCTOR Well, I wouldn't go that far.
GEORGE What? Oh my God. What? Is it meningitis? Scoliosis? Lupis?! Is it Lupis?!
DOCTOR Have you ever had your tonsils taken out?
GEORGE My tonsils? Yeah, when I was a kid.
DOCTOR Well, they've grown back. Your adenoids are swollen too.
GEORGE Really?
ELAINE Whose tonsils grow back?
DOCTOR It happens.
JERRY Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays.
ELAINE I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils.
DOCTOR That's interesting. Because, no one in my family has their tonsils, and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people.
JERRY Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.
GEORGE Excuse me!
DOCTOR Anyway, I strongly recommend they come out.
GEORGE What? You mean with a knife?
DOCTOR Yes. With a knife. You know, snip, snip. Anyway, you'd be completely under, you wouldn't feel a thing. And when you wake up, you can have some ice cream.
GEORGE Yeah, that's what they told me the last time.
DOCTOR Think about it. Excuse me.
ELAINE Oh, I'm sorry. I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question.
JERRY Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital! So, how did you have a heart attack? You're a young man. What were you doing? Are they gonna do a zipper job? Oh, they love to do zipper jobs.
JERRY Kramer.
KRAMER The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! Next thing you know, you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage.
JERRY Kramer, George didn't have a heart attack.
KRAMER No? That's good.
GEORGE I have to have my tonsils taken out.
KRAMER Oh man.. No.. George, we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill ya in here.
JERRY It's routine surgery.
KRAMER Oh yeah? My friend, Bob Saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah, routine surgery.. now he's sittin' around in a chair by a window going, "My name is Bob" .. George, whatever you do, don't let 'em cut you. Don't let 'em cut you..
GEORGE Well, what should I do, Kramer?
JERRY Well, for one think, don't listen to him.
KRAMER I'll tell you what to do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids, he is gonna change the whole way you function - body and mind.
JERRY Eckman? I thought he was doing time?
KRAMER No, no, he's out. He got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel.
JERRY A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor.
KRAMER He's holistic, George. He's holistic.
GEORGE Holistic.. that sounds right.
JERRY George, you need a medical doctor.
GEORGE Let me ask you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital?
JERRY Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand.
GEORGE Uh-huh. And how much does the healer charge?
KRAMER First visit? Thirty-eight bucks.
GEORGE Oh, yeah? Holistic.. that's what I need. That's the answer.
GEORGE So, how do you like the way I talked you into comin' down here?
JERRY Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though.
GEORGE All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm already facing the problems of old age. I completely skipped healthy adulthood. I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. You could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. I've never had a normal, medium orgasm.
JERRY I've never had a really good pickle.
GEORGE Besides, what's it gonna cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?
TOR Would you not put your foot on that please?
JERRY Sorry.
TOR What month were you born?
GEORGE April.
TOR You should have been born in August. Your parents would have been well-advised to wait.
GEORGE Really?
TOR Do you use hot water in the shower?
GEORGE Yes.
TOR Stop using it.
GEORGE ..Okay.
KRAMER I'm off hot water.
TOR Kramer tells me that you are interested in an alternative to surgery.
GEORGE Yes, yes I am.
TOR I think we can help you. See, unfortunately, the medical establishment is a business like any other business. And business needs customers. And, they want to sell you their most expensive item which is unnecessary surgery.
GEORGE Can I use hot water on my face?
TOR No. You know, I am not a business man. I'm a holistic healer. It's a calling, it's a gift. You see, it's in the best interest of the medical profession that you remain sick. You see, that insures good business. You're not a patient. You're a customer.
JERRY And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.
GEORGE What about shaving?
TOR You're eating too much dairy. May I?
GEORGE I guess so.
TOR You see, you are in disharmony. The throat is the gateway to the lung. Tonsillitis, adenoiditis, is, in Chinese medical terms, and invasion of heat and wind.
JERRY There's some hot air blowing in here..
TOR You know, I lived with the Eskimos many years ago, and they used to plunge their faces into the snow.
GEORGE Could it be lukewarm?
JERRY Too much dairy? You really think I'm eating too much dairy?
DOCTOR ..The tongue.. yes, the tongue.. or, in medical terms, the glossa. It's a muscular organ.. Consists of two parts.. the body, and the root.. You see, it's covered by this mucous membrane.. These little raised projections are the papillae, which give it that furry appearance. Very tactile..
ELAINE Uh-huh.
TOR Your tea is ready now. This will solve your so-called tonsil problem. It's a special concoction. It contains crampbark.
JERRY I love crampbark.
TOR Cleavers.
JERRY Cleaver, I once had cleaver as a kid. I was able to lift a car.
TOR And some couchgrass.
JERRY Couchgrass and crampbark? You know, I think that's what killed Curly.
KRAMER Go ahead, drink it, George.
JERRY Excuse me, Tor. May I ask you a question? You have intuitive abilities. You're in touch with a lot of this cosmic kind of things.. I have this note I can't read. I was wondering if-
TOR Oh, yes.. yes.. "Cleveland 117, San Antonio 109..
KRAMER Go ahead, drink it, George.
GEORGE Hey, it's not too bad..
GEORGE I'm an eggplant! I'm an eggplant! I'm a minstrel man!
DRIVER I didn't take your Chuckle, man!
ASSISTANT I had five Chuckles. I ate a green one, and the yellow one, and the red one is missing!
DRIVER I don't even like Chuckles!
JERRY Maybe he doesn't like them. That's possible.
GEORGE My face! My face! Get me to the hospital!
ASSISTANT I want that Chuckle! You hear me?!
JERRY I'll get you a Chuckle. You want me to get you a Chuckle?
ASSISTANT Pull over!
DRIVER Pull over? Did you say pull over?! You want a piece of me?!
ASSISTANT Yeah!
JERRY You're gonna fight?
GEORGE Now?! I'm a mutant!
KRAMER Hey, let me drive.
ASSISTANT Come on, man. Pull over!
DRIVER Alright! I'm gonna mess you up, man!
JERRY Really, gentlemen, please.
GEORGE My heart! My heart! Where you going? Are you crazy?!
ASSISTANT I'm gonna kick his ass.
KRAMER Hey, you have keys?
GEORGE You can't leave! This is an ambulance! This is an emergency!
JERRY All this for a Chuckle.
KRAMER What's a Chuckle?
JERRY It's a jelly candy. it comes in five flavors.
DOCTOR You see, taste buds run on grooves along the surfaces.
ELAINE Can you let go of my tongue now?
DOCTOR What?
ELAINE Let go of my tongue!
DOCTOR Oh, sorry.
ELAINE Well, I should get going.. What are you doing?
DOCTOR I was going to kiss you good night.
ELAINE A kiss? With the tongue? The glossa with the bumps and the papillae? ..Yech, I don't think so.
JERRY You just can't leave him out there.
DRIVER I told him I was gonna mess him up.
KRAMER Well, can you call him an ambulance?
DRIVER I told him I didn't take his Chuckle. I don't eat that gooey crap!
KRAMER hey, watch the road! Watch the road, man!
DRIVER Hey, man, you want some of what he got?!
JERRY_AND_KRAMER Watch out!
JERRY How ya doing? Can't talk? Hey, how'd you get the plastic one? I like that. So how's life without tonsils? What? What's that? ..So, how much is this thing gonna cost you now? Like, five, six thousand?.. Well, live and learn.. at least we lived. Kramer went to Eckman.. He feels better alreadyy.. What are you doing?
ELAINE Oh, poor George. Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't stay long. I don't want to run into Doctor Tongue.. Here, I brought you something. Oh, please, come on.. it was nothing.
JERRY Hey, check the TV.
TV_VOICE It's just as you prophesied. The planets of our solar system, incinerating. Like flaming globes, Sigmond. Like flaming globes. Ah, ha, ha, ha..
JERRY That's it! That's it! Flaming globes of Sigmond! Flaming Globes of Sigmond! That's my note! tha'ts what I thought was so funny?! ..That's not funny.. There's nothing funny about that.
MAN Aaahhhgggg!
JERRY I have a friend who's a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick - never is. And they, you have another type of person, always thinks they're well, not matter how bad they really are. You know this type of person? Very annoying. "Feel great.. like being on the respirator.. intravenous heart/lung machine. I never felt better in my life." Medical science is making advances every day in control health problems. In fact, it's probably only a matter of time before a heart attack, you know, becomes like, a head ache. We'll just see people on TV going, "I had a heart attack this big ..but, I gave myself one of these. Clear! Brrhht.. and it's gone!"
JERRY I really feel as human beings, we need more training in our basic social skills. Conversational Distance, don't you hate these people that talk to you they talk into your mouth like you're a clown at a drive-through and Hand shakes is the worst, there's absolutely no guidelines for hand shakes you know these people? Too long, too weak, sometimes they give you the three-quarter handshake just the fingers, early release, late release, sometimes people will dispute your release, you let go there're hangin' on. I have actually said to people 'Hey the handshake is over!.' Too many pumps, coming in too high, too sweaty, coming from too far away. Sometimes a guy will give you a strong grip, late release, and pull you in for the too close conversation. To him I say 'That's three strikes you're out.'
JERRY You know their timing couldn't be worse.
GEORGE Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?
JERRY You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm getting a little uh backed up.
GEORGE When are they leaving for Paris?
JERRY Not for another three days.
GEORGE What about her place?
JERRY She lives with her parents.
GEORGE Really? Maybe this will become like a cool thing, living with your parents.
JERRY Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will all be turning your way.
GEORGE Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come, who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?
JERRY The baldies
GEORGE Hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over dinner before they leave town.
JERRY That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present.
ALEC Hey guys.
GEORGE Hey Alec
JERRY Hey Alec
ALEC This is Joey.
GEORGE Hey Joey, how you doin'?
ALEC Hey listen, I was wondering if either one of you guys would be interested in doing some work for the Big Brother program? I'm kinda running the local chapter. What do you say George?
GEORGE Well uh....
JOEY Wouldn't you like to be a big brother to someone like me? Please?
GEORGE Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled.
ALEC That's great George, thanks a lot I'll get in touch with you.
JOEY Wouldn't you like to be a big brother..
ALEC Ya alright Joey that's enough, let's go See ya.
JERRY What happened?
GEORGE What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid?
JERRY Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me? Please?
JERRY Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy now?
GEORGE Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now they do it right after single Jeopardy.
JERRY Ya, it's much better isn't it?
GEORGE Oh, n-no comparison.
JERRY Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one of those French-English dictionaries.
GEORGE Hey hey hey hey hey hey.
JERRY What?
GEORGE Your parents are going to Paris right?
JERRY Yea?
GEORGE So I tell Alec that I have to go to Paris for an undetermined amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have your parents mail them from Paris.
JERRY What about little Joey?
GEORGE Who?
JERRY Ah, I think he's probably better off.
GEORGE I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you get to Paris all you have to do is drop 'em in any mailbox.
MORTY But there are no stamps on these.
GEORGE Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps I-I'll reimburse you of course.
HELEN Why are you doing this?
JERRY He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.
HELEN Why?
JERRY Because George is a deeply disturbed individual.
KRAMER Oh hey, Helen uh, Could I uh, use some more of your hand lotion?
HELEN I told you it was good.
KRAMER Ya
HELEN It's from the Sachs Fifth Avenue in Miami.
KRAMER Mmm I'm gonna remember that if I'm ever in Florida.
JERRY Ya, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you could get some there.
KRAMER Ya
MORTY Say those are some nice pants. I got a pair just like them at home.
KRAMER Well uh that doesn't surprise me, ya i bought these at Rudy's. It's a used clothing store. See when people like you die, the widows they bring in their wardrobes, they make a bundle.
GEORGE Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in the attic, y-you think they're worth something?
KRAMER Ya if they're vintage, and you're a widow.
GEORGE What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in the clothing in then?
KRAMER Well I suppose the children do.
GEORGE Yes I suppose they do.
KRAMER Alright I gotta a ten o'clock, I'll see everybody later.
GEORGE Hey oo, I just remembered uh my parents really wanna have you guys over for dinner before you leave town. What about tonight?
HELEN Tonight?
GEORGE Yea they're making Payaya.
HELEN Uh oh I don't think we think we can make it tonight, we have plans.
JERRY What plans?
HELEN We have plans.
JERRY Where'd you get plans?
HELEN We have plans.
GEORGE Well um, what about tomorrow night?
HELEN Maybe
GEORGE Ok uh, I guess I'll tell them that.
MORTY Hey give 'em our best though.
GEORGE Ya.
JERRY I'll call you later.
GEORGE Ya.
JERRY So what plans do you have?
MORTY None
JERRY So how come you're not going over there for dinner?
HELEN Jerry we don't care much for the Costanzas'.
MORTY We can't stand them.
JERRY Really? Since when?
HELEN Since always. We've never liked them.
JERRY Why?
HELEN Well they're so loud, they're always fighting it's uncomfortable, you never notice?
JERRY No I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind.
MORTY Well we do.
JERRY Ya?
ELAINE It's us.
JERRY U-oh come on up. It's Elaine you don't have a problem with her do you?
HELEN We adore Elaine.
JERRY She wants to say hi, she's with her new boyfriend.

AARON See everybody later
JERRY Ok.
ELAINE Why would he ask your parents to go to a museum?
JERRY I don't know.
ELAINE What is that?
JERRY Maybe he was just trying to be nice.
ELAINE Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this?
JERRY Wait a second, he just did me a big favor.
ELAINE What?
JERRY He got em out of the house.
ELAINE What?
JERRY Call Rachel.
ELAINE Oh.
JERRY ah no, I got the machine. Rachel! Are you there?! I got the place to myself for a few hours! Rachel! Where are you? Rachel!
ELAINE Sorry pal, wish I could help you out.
FRANK They're not coming?
GEORGE No, they had plans.
ESTELLE How could they have plans?
GEORGE That's what I wanna know.
FRANK Well what difference does it make? They wouldn't lie to us, they're are dear friends.
ESTELLE What am I supposed to do with all this Paella?
GEORGE They said tomorrow, maybe.
FRANK Maybe?
ESTELLE Maybe they don't like us.
FRANK Why wouldn't they like us? Again with the pepper? What do you gotta use all the pepper for?
ESTELLE Ah keep quiet.
FRANK What are you trying to set my mouth on fire?
GEORGE I don't know what the reason could be.
JERRY Oh, Hi, hi.
AARON Ah Jerry you would not believe the time we had.
HELEN Aaron is quite the tour guide.
MORTY Jerry have you ever seen any of those impressionist paintings?
JERRY Oh sure like Monet.
MORTY Don't you think he had to be uh near sighted? I mean nobody would paint like that if they could see. It's all out of focus.
JERRY Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet, Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday.
MORTY I say the guy was painting without his glasses.
JERRY Hello? Rachel, ya uh no they're back.
HELEN Jerry if you have something to do we could just sit right here and read.
JERRY Uh haha ya well uh I'm sorry too I'll call you later, ok bye
AARON Well I should be going.
HELEN Oh thanks again.
HELEN_AND_AARON Buh bye.
AARON Oh you must be Kramer I've heard about you.
KRAMER You must be Aaron, I've heard about you.
AARON Well see you later.
KRAMER Yeah.
AARON Bye
JERRY Bye
KRAMER So uh what are you guys doing for dinner?
HELEN We have no plans.
MORTY Look at that, Helen do you see what he's wearing? That's the Executive.
KRAMER Now what is Executive?
JERRY The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.
MORTY I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic, these haven't been made in twenty years.
HELEN Why would they? Nobody bought them then.
MORTY He's wearing one.
KRAMER Yea these are a hot item over at Rudy's.
MORTY You don't say? You know I have boxes of those sitting in my garage in Florida?
KRAMER Get 'em up here. You give me twenty-five percent I-I'll take care of everything.
MORTY You gotta deal.
KRAMER Yaaaa.
JERRY This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.
MORTY I'll call Jack Klompus, he's got a key to the garage. He can send them overnight delivery.
HELEN You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris in three days.
MORTY He'll send them express.
HELEN You're crazy.
MORTY I'll tell you how crazy I am, I'm gonna pay for this whole trip with these coats.
JERRY N-na I'm paying for the trip.
MORTY So much the better.
GEORGE Anyway it's kind of a fluke thing but uh I'll be leaving for Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there.
ALEC Paris huh?
GEORGE Yea, ya..ya know I feel terrible about Joey but it's jus..it's a great business opportunity. I-I don't even know how long I'm gonna be away for.
ALEC Where will you stay?
GEORGE An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry.
ALEC George, you have no idea how fantastic this is.
GEORGE Fantastic?
ALEC Ya, we've been trying to reunite Joey with his father who lives in Paris. But he's afraid to fly alone, you know he's kinda withdrawn, but he seems to take to you. So it's a perfect solution.
GEORGE How gee what a coincidence.
ALEC And you'll send me a postcard.
AARON Helen really seemed to respond to Renoir. I think she really connected to the way he painted children.
ELAINE Mm hmm.
AARON And that Morty, I'll tell ya that guy is full of life. He was convinced Monet was near sighted. I kept telling him
ELAINE Aaron
AARON Yes?
ELAINE Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you?
AARON Well, they were in from out of town, I thought they would enjoy it.
ELAINE Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your age?
AARON No, it was fun.
ELAINE You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.
AARON Yea, they bought me a coke.
KRAMER So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat?
MORTY I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys. So I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror.
KRAMER How serendipitous.
MORTY So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.
KRAMER Mmm
JERRY He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized. Alright come on let's play.
KRAMER Did you call Jack Klompus yet?
MORTY I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now.
JERRY Ah come on.
MORTY Just a second.
HELEN Jerry have you seen Schindler's List?
JERRY No I haven't seen it yet.
HELEN Oh you have to go you have to
JERRY I'm going
HELEN You have to
JERRY Ok
MORTY Hello Jack.
JACK Ya
MORTY It's Morty
JACK Who died?
MORTY Nobody died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor. In my garage there are a couple of boxes.
JACK What boxes?
MORTY I'm gonna explain what boxes.
JACK Alright how the hell do I know?
MORTY Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I want you to ship them here to New York for me.
JACK I thought you're going to Paris
MORTY I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here.
JACK What's in the boxes?
MORTY Raincoats.
JACK Raincoats? You think you're gonna sell those old crappy raincoats? That's garbage.
HELEN I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.
JACK When do you want these?
MORTY Send them tomorrow.
ESTELLE You think they're coming tonight?
GEORGE I dunno they said maybe.
FRANK Of course they're coming, they're leaving soon. If they don't come tonight they might not see us.
ESTELLE Well they better come, I got all this Paella.
FRANK I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip, maybe a cruise.
GEORGE Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you.
ESTELLE Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night?
GEORGE I-I wasn't in the attic.
ESTELLE I heard noise.
GEORGE Maybe it was a mouse.
FRANK OK that's it! We're moving!
GEORGE What?
FRANK I will not tolerate infestation.
GEORGE You haven't even seen one.
FRANK Don't you understand the very thought, the very idea, I'll never be comfortable again.
ESTELLE All right Frank that's enough.
GEORGE I guess I've been hanging on to them for so long cuz i couldn't accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever
RUDY Uh huh.
GEORGE They will get a good home won't they?
RUDY Look I gotta be honest with you there's nothing here too spectacular.
GEORGE Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, he was a very handsome man, a Casanova really.
RUDY I'll give you uh two-hundred dollars for the three boxes.
GEORGE Could you make it two-twenty-five that was his hi-game in bowling.
RUDY Yea I'm in a good mood here.
GEORGE Thank you.
KRAMER Hey, George what are you doing here?
GEORGE Uh, I'm just selling some of Dad's things, that's what he would have wanted.
KRAMER Oh, I gotcha
GEORGE That'll do.
KRAMER Oh hey guess what. Morty Seinfeld and I are going into business together, selling raincoats.
GEORGE Hey that's swell.
KRAMER Yea we worked it out all over dinner last night.
GEORGE Dinner?
KRAMER Ya.
GEORGE You had dinner with the Seinfelds?
KRAMER Yea, last night.
GEORGE Was this something you had planned for a while?
KRAMER No it was a spur of the moment. Well you know Morty likes to fly by the seat of his vintage pants.
GEORGE They had plans, They had plans!
KRAMER Oooo, boy I've never seen these before
RUDY Well they just came in, part of my spring-time cruise collection. Two for twenty-five dollars.
KRAMER Oh I'll take these.
RUDY All right
KRAMER Hey, remember this raincoat that you sold me?
RUDY Sure that's the Executive.
KRAMER Ya, you have any others?
RUDY I wish. They don't make 'em anymore.
KRAMER Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint condition, would you be interested?
RUDY Very interested
KRAMER Cuz they're coming in from Florida as we speak.
RUDY Well bring 'em in.
KRAMER So you'll buy them?
RUDY I don't see what would possibly stop me.
GEORGE Aaaa aaaa Ah ha. They had plans huh? They were busy. They were busy with their big plans!
JERRY What are you talking about?
GEORGE Mom and Pop Seinfeld
JERRY Look I don't know.
GEORGE All right I happen to know what they did last night, they had dinner with Kramer.
JERRY Oh they were tired it was a last minute thing.
GEORGE So what's the deal they don't want to have dinner with my parents?
JERRY That's right.
GEORGE Is there something wrong with my parents?
JERRY Absolutely
GEORGE Because my parents happen to be two pretty wonderful people.
JERRY These the people you currently live with?
GEORGE Yes.
JERRY Uh huh
GEORGE So are they coming tonight or not?
JERRY Look I really don't know what they're plans are.
GEORGE Ok, fine. It's going to be very interesting, very interesting if they don't show up tonight. You know my mother made all this Paella.
JERRY What is that anyway?
GEORGE It's a Spanish dish. It's a m�lange of fish, an meat with rice. Very tasty.
JERRY I-I'll tell 'em
GEORGE Hey could you do one other thing for me?
JERRY Name it.
GEORGE You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them? It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris. Is that a coincidence? Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going
JERRY So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?
GEORGE All right if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards.
JOANNE So where's he taking you?
ELAINE Well first we're going to a matinee, I'm taking the afternoon off, we're gonna go see "My Fair Lady" and they we are gonna go to dinner. He knows all these fantastic places.
JOANNE You are one lucky girl. Wish I could find a nice guy. Hi Aaron.
AARON Hey Joanne. Hey
ELAINE Hi
HELEN Hello, Hello.
MORTY Hello Elaine
AARON I was able to finagle two more tickets to "My Fair Lady" and I thought why not ask Morty and Helen.
ELAINE Oh, Great.
MORTY This is some office. What's the square footage?
HELEN You don't mind to you Elaine?
ELAINE Mind? Oh o-of course not.
AARON We can make a whole day of it.
MORTY This is some building, Harry Fleming used to have an office here. There was a deli on the first floor. You don't get corned beef like that anymore. What happened to that deli?
ELAINE I really don't know Mr. Seinfeld
JERRY We better not. T-They're gonna be here any second.
RACHEL When are they leaving?
JERRY In two days.
RACHEL It's been soo long.

MORTY We'll take a bus.
JERRY Come on stop.
HELEN No we don't mind
MORTY I'll get a book.
RACHEL No no it's ok, I was just leaving anyway.
HELEN O-oh are you sure?
RACHEL Yea.
HELEN Cuz we don't wann..
JERRY No no it's ok. So we'll go see Schindler's List later right?
RACHEL Definitely
JERRY Ok. Uh
RACHEL It's night meeting you.
HELEN Nice meeting you.
JERRY Ok, see you later.
MORTY Boy that was some show.
JERRY What show?
MORTY "My Fair Lady"
JERRY When did you get tickets to see that?
HELEN Aaron surprised us, and Elaine came.
JERRY Oh Elaine really? Well that sounds interesting.
MORTY We saw Regis Philbin get out of a limousine.
JERRY Oh.
HELEN He looks better on TV.
JERRY Oh
JERRY Hello?
JACK Hello Jerry,
JERRY Yea.
JACK It's Jack Klompus.
JERRY Oh hi Jack.
JACK So when are you coming down to Florida again?
JERRY As soon as is humanly possible.
JACK You know I still got that pen, the one that writes upside down.
JERRY Yea yea yea I shoulda kept it.
JACK So uh where's your father?
JERRY Ya he's right here.
MORTY Yea
JACK Morty, listen I can't get into the garage.
MORTY What do you mean?
JACK There is something wrong with the key. The key doesn't work
MORTY You gotta jiggle it a little bit.
JACK I jiggled it. I jiggled it for fifteen minutes.
DORIS Tell him to come down here and get his own packages. You have nothing better to do then worry about his boxes.
MORTY You gotta pull on the knob as you turn it.
JACK Get the hell outta here with your knob.
DORIS What does he want from you?
MORTY My idiot son could open that garage door.
JERRY What did I do?
MORTY Just do it first thing tomorrow. I need it.
MORTY They'll be here first thing Thursday morning.
HELEN Thursday morning? You know we're leaving at three o'clock.
JERRY Yea you're leaving at three o'clock.
HELEN How are you gonna get all this done in time?
MORTY Don't worry about it.
JERRY Ya how you gonna get all this done in time?
GEORGE They were drinking champagne in a buggy!
FRANK First Kramer, then Elaine?
GEORGE Yea
FRANK It's a slap in the face.
ESTELLE What did we ever do to them? I want to know what we did them!
FRANK What are they too good for us? A raincoat salesman, I could buy and sell 'em like that.
ESTELLE The hell with them.
GEORGE The thing that bothers me the most, is the lying.
FRANK Let's forget about it. We're going on a beautiful vacation.
GEORGE Vacation?
FRANK You're mother and I are planning on taking a cruise.
GEORGE Ah!
FRANK But I can't find any vacation clothes. They were in the attic.
GEORGE The attic? Y-you haven't wore any of those clothes for years.
FRANK How can I go on a cruise with out my cabana wear? I love those, those clothes. Ah! A mouse! I saw a mouse!
GEORGE It's the remote.
FRANK Where the hell are my clothes? I love those clothes.
RUDY Lousy moth ridden crap.
JERRY I-I-I'm not crazy about used clothes. I mean they call it vintage, you know to take your mind off of what it really is 'nasty wear.' Oh it's clean you know people wear underwear, ya well they don't wear iron underwear and that's what it's gonna take to get me in those clothes. I mean I'll move into an apartment after a strange person moves out, why would I wanna move into somebody's pants? There is no vintage underwear of course, but it's not because the guy couldn't sell his underwear, it's because men wear their underwear until it absolutely disintegrates. Men hang on to underwear until, until each individual underwear molecule is so strained it can barely retain the properties of a solid. It actually becomes underwear vapor. W-we don't even throw it out, we just open a window and it goes out like dandelion spoors. That's how men throw out underwear we just go and it's gone that it is jus.
JERRY Hey.
MORTY Hey, Jerry.
HELEN So how was the movie?
JERRY Oh, really good, really good.
HELEN And didn't the three hours go by just like that
JERRY Like that
MORTY What about the end, with the list?
JERRY Ya that was some list.
HELEN What did you think about the black and white?
JERRY The black and white.
MORTY The whole movie was in black and white.
JERRY Oh yea, I didn't even realize.
MORTY You don't even think about it, there's so much going on.
JERRY Ya ya, I tell ya I could see it again.
KRAMER So Klompus has the key, but the jerk couldn't open it up. All you gotta do it jiggle it jus get it in there jigg jigg jiggle reiggle
RUDY Look, I find this whole thing very uninteresting. When you get the coats come in.
KRAMER Ya hey I'm on your side.
KRAMER Hey what again?
GEORGE I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back. Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra Paella.
KRAMER Payaya, ya I'll be there.
GEORGE Apparently the Seinfelds' are too good for us. I shouldn't say anything bad about your uh your partner.
KRAMER No no you know we're not partners. I only get twenty-five percent.
GEORGE Twenty-five percent? It was your idea.
KRAMER Yap I know.
GEORGE You're doing all the leg work.
KRAMER That's right
GEORGE He's ripping you off
KRAMER You're right he's ripping me off
GEORGE If anybody should be getting more it's you.
KRAMER He's ripping me off
GEORGE Well don't let him take advantage of you like that.
KRAMER Yah!
RUDY Oh it's you? You're the one who sold me the moth ridden cabana crap.
MORTY You know I've been thinking, why is Kramer getting twenty-five percent?
HELEN Well he told you about the place.
MORTY So what, why is that worth twenty-five percent? It's a finders fee. You know what a finders fee is?
HELEN You find something you get a fee.
MORTY Finder's fee is ten percent and no more.
HELEN Well it's too late now.
MORTY Those are my coats. I saved them, I stored them, I've been waiting years for this pay off.
HELEN Well you're not gonna say anything.
KRAMER I've been thinking about something.
MORTY Ya so have I
KRAMER Ahh! I don't think the deal is fair.
MORTY You don't think it's fair.
KRAMER No no, I found the place, I set the whole thing up, I'm doing all the leg work.
MORTY What leg work?
KRAMER Oh, there's leg work.
MORTY If anything you're getting too much.
KRAMER Too much?!
MORTY That's right, they're my coats.
KRAMER Look I want thirty-five percent.
MORTY I'm thinking more like fifteen.
KRAMER No way I'm taking fifteen.
MORTY Well you're not getting thirty-five.
KRAMER Alright let's compromise. Twenty-five percent.
MORTY Ok it's a deal
RUDY Moths are a discourage to my business, all it takes is one moth to lay eggs. You know what happens to the larvae? They hatch and they're everywhere.
GEORGE I'm sorry, umm he-here's your money back I-I-I'll have the clothes.
RUDY It's already put a dent in my fumigation bill.
GEORGE So uh where are the clothes?
RUDY I burned 'em.
GEORGE Oh. That's good.
ELAINE I know they're your parents Jerry and they're very nice people. But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? I mean don't you find that abnormal?
JERRY It is a tad askew.
ELAINE I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why is this stranger doing it?
JERRY I've hardly been out to dinner with them.
ELAINE See, See, I can't even say anything you know because all he's really doing is being nice but but nobody is this nice, this is like certifiably nice.
JERRY You're right he's insane.
ELAINE Yes, he's insane, that's what I think.
JERRY So what are you going to do?
ELAINE I don't know, I don't know what to do. Oh god.... so how was the movie?
JERRY Uh from what I saw it was pretty good.
ELAINE Ya what do you mean from what you saw?
JERRY Well I um I didn't ah actually get to see the whole movie.
ELAINE Yea why not?
JERRY I was kind of um making out.
ELAINE You were making, out during Schindler's List?
JERRY I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just got the better of me.
ELAINE During Schindler's List?
JERRY We're both living with our parents.
ELAINE Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything?
JERRY No I don't think so. I saw Newman as I was leaving but see me.
ELAINE Oh.
NEWMAN Hello Mrs. Seinfeld
HELEN Hello, Newman. Jerry's not here.
NEWMAN Uh ah Having a nice trip?
HELEN Wonderful, we went to the theater last night.
NEWMAN Oh the theater. Because I was wondering.
HELEN Wondering what?
NEWMAN Why I didn't see you at Schindler's List with Jerry.
HELEN Well we already saw it.
NEWMAN Oh, well it's a good thing for Jerry that you didn't go.
MORTY Why is that?
NEWMAN Well he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what I mean.
HELEN I'm afraid I don't.
NEWMAN Him and his little buxom friend Rachel were going at it pretty good in the balcony.
MORTY What?
NEWMAN What, do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like the storm-troopers into Poland.
HELEN Jerry was necking during Schindler's List?
NEWMAN Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot recall. Anyway I just really came up to get some detergent.
HELEN Jerry sends his laundry out.
NEWMAN Oh ho right. Well very nice seeing you folks and a by the way you didn't hear this from me. Tata
JERRY Hi What? What did I do?
HELEN How could you?
JERRY How could I what?
HELEN You were making out during Schindler's List?
JERRY What? No.
MORTY Don't lie Jerry.
JERRY Newman.
HELEN How could you do such a thing?
JERRY I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone together in a long time and we just kinda started up a little during the coming attractions and the next thing we knew, the war was over.
JERRY Hello.
JACK Hello Jerry, it's Jack Klompus.
JERRY Hang on a second. Dad it's Klompus.
MORTY Hello
JACK Hello Morty, listen that key doesn't work. It's no good.
MORTY You didn't get in?
JACK Oh I got in, I had to break the window with a rock and then I got my hand all cut up reaching in.
MORTY You broke the window?
HELEN He broke the window?
JACK You wanted those damn boxes didn't you?
DORIS He should be on his hands and knees thanking you.
MORTY Did you send them?
JACK Yea, they'll be there tomorrow afternoon, two o'clock.
MORTY Tomorrow afternoon?
HELEN Tomorrow afternoon?
JERRY Tomorrow afternoon?
MORTY I told you to send them express.
JACK W-well it was ten dollars cheaper in the afternoon than the morning, I figured what the hell's the difference.
MORTY So what did you do about the window?
JACK I gotta fix your window now?
MORTY All right all right. Goodbye. I don't think we are gonna make that flight.
JERRY W-what do you mean you're not making the flight?
HELEN We have to make the flight, we're with a charter group. If we don't the trip is off.
MORTY Well what's the difference we'll go some place else.
HELEN Some place else? What about Paris?
MORTY You don't understand, I've come this far, I can't stop now.
HELEN I can't believe that you're doing all this just to sell some stupid raincoats.
MORTY You don't understand fashion is cyclical this thing could come back.
HELEN I think you're out of your mind.
FRANK I just don't understand how all those clothes can disappear.
GEORGE Moths?
FRANK Moths, ate three boxes?
GEORGE Well you know what happens with larvae hatch, they-they're everywhere.
ESTELLE You know, I was thinking today. I never liked those Seinfelds anyway, he's an idiot all together. Ah there's Kramer.
KRAMER Hello?
ESTELLE Hello
KRAMER Helowwwowwow Hey Ha ha, Good evening
ESTELLE Hope you're hungry.
KRAMER Ooo Paella
GEORGE Hey uh let me take your coat.
KRAMER Oh ya thanks buddy.
FRANK That shirt, where'd you get that shirt?
KRAMER Wha?
FRANK That's my cabana shirt, you stole my shirt you son of a bitch! George you let your friends go up in my attic and steal my clothes? Gimme that back
KRAMER woah
GEORGE Dad?!
KRAMER I bought it from Rudy.
GEORGE Rudy?! That skunk, I knew he didn't burn those clothes.
FRANK Who's Rudy? What clothes?
GEORGE I sold your clothes yesterday.
FRANK You sold my clothes what do you mean you sold my clothes?
GEORGE I didn't think you wore them anymore.
FRANK It's cruise wear!
ESTELLE Kramer, I love that shirt.
KRAMER Yaya
FRANK Thats's because it's mine!
ESTELLE You look just like Frank, on our honeymoon.
KRAMER Oh, well, thank you.
FRANK Who's this Rudy?
KRAMER Well Rudy's the guy buying Morty's raincoats.
FRANK Mory Seinfeld? He's a bum.
KRAMER Well, the whole deal going down tomorrow. Morty's gonna miss his plane for it.
GEORGE Missing his plane? Wasn't that a charter flight?
KRAMER Yea.
GEORGE What happens to charter tickets when you don't use em?
KRAMER Well I suppose they are wasted.
GEORGE Yes I suppose they are.
FRANK Tomorrow I'm going straight down to this Rudy and get my clothes.
KRAMER A mouse!
JERRY You want the tickets?
GEORGE Yes.
JERRY You're gonna take this kid to Paris?
GEORGE Hey I get a free trip to Paris, I go in the Big Brother's Hall-of-Fame, I mail my own postcards.
JERRY You know I'm paying for these tickets.
GEORGE It's alright, I got lunch.
KRAMER Oh, you should have gone to the Costanzas' for dinner. Mmm the Payaya was magnificent. Have you ever had really good Paella?
MORTY Not really.
KRAMER Oh it's a orgiastic feast for the senses. The want and the festival, the sites, sounds, and colors an mmmummumm mumm
JERRY Hey Dad are you sure we are at the right carousel?
MORTY This is it.
KRAMER So how much are we gonna make?
MORTY Take it easy, I've been through a million of these negotiations.
KRAMER Wha two thousand? Three thousand?
MORTY That's giving it away. This is a one of a kind item.
KRAMER More? More than three thousand?
MORTY Just watch me do my thing.
JERRY Say Dad, isn't that one of yours?
MORTY Look at this. Look at how this idiot packed it. He didn't tape it, he just flipped the flaps. Kramer you missed a couple.
WOMAN Bon-jour, welcome to the Gateway to Paris Charter Flight.
JERRY Dad isn't that your charter group?
GEORGE Honesty, hard-work, these are the values that I was raised on. The most important thing Joey, is to be able to look yourself in the mirror before you go to sleep at night.
JOEY Hey! I got news for you four eyes, there's no way you're staying with us in Paris.
FRANK You burned them? Those clothes are not yours to burn.
RUDY Who are you anyways?
FRANK I'm the father.
RUDY He said his father was dead.
FRANK He said I was dead?
RUDY That's right. Squeezed an extra twenty-five dollars out of me.
FRANK That's what my life is worth to him? Twenty-five dollars.
KRAMER Hey, Frank!
FRANK Oh, I just want to you know I'm retracting our dinner invitation.
MORTY Well you don't have to retract it because we never went.
FRANK I'm retracting that it was ever offered.
MORTY I retract your retraction.
FRANK Oh, you trying to unload some of that junk of yours?
MORTY Would you excuse me please, we're conducting business here.
RUDY You can keep your raincoats. I'm not interested.
KRAMER I thought we had a deal?
FRANK That's another one of my shirts!!
RUDY I'm not buying anymore clothes from anyone off the street.
MORTY Who's off the street? I'm in the raincoat business for thirty-five years.
RUDY Ya how do I know there aren't moths like his stuff?
FRANK My clothes don't have moths!
MORTY Because of his moths you're not buying my raincoats?
RUDY That's right.
KRAMER I'm all ticklish.
ANNOUNCEMENT Flight-433 now boarding for Miami, Gate 18a. Flight-433 now boarding.
MORTY Ok, let's go.
HELEN It was so nice of you to come to the airport to see us off.
AARON Are you sure you can't stay a little longer?
ELAINE_AND_JERRY No.
MORTY Ah, good-bye.
ELAINE Good-bye
JERRY Take care
MORTY Alright Jer.
ELAINE Nice to see..
MORTY Buh bye Elaine
JERRY Buh bye.
HELEN Buh bye.
HELEN We'll call you when we get home.
AARON Thank you.
JERRY I think she meant me, but.
MORTY Make sure Kramer uses good tape when he sends back the raincoats.
JERRY Ok.
ELAINE Bye.
JERRY Bye.
ELAINE Aaron? Aaron are you ok?
AARON I could've done more. I could've done so much more.
ELAINE You did enough.
AARON No, I could've called the travel agency, got them on another flight to Paris, I coulda got them out.
JERRY You tried Aaron, it was too expensive.
AARON This watch, this watch could've paid for their whole trip. This ring, this ring is one more dinner I could've taken them out to. Water, they need some water
ELAINE Why?
AARON They'll get dehydrated on the plane! Get the Seinfelds some water. Please! Please!
JERRY Hi Mr. Goldstein is Rachel home?
MR._GOLDSTEIN I'm afraid Rachel's not going to be able to see you tonight, or any other night for that matter.
JERRY Why what did I do?
MR._GOLDSTEIN You know very well. I heard about your behavior at the movies the other night it was disgraceful. You should be ashamed of yourself, I for one will not allow my daughter to be involved with someone of such weak moral fiber. Fortunately my postman happened to have witnessed the entire incident. A heavy set fellow, I believe he lives in your building. Now if you don't mind.
JERRY Rachel!
MR._GOLDSTEIN Good night!
JERRY Rachel!
JERRY So my parents get home, they open the door, my father flicks the light on, the whole place is cleaned out, everything.
ELAINE Aahh, Get Out! How did it happen?
JERRY The broken window, Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right in.
ELAINE Oohh, boy. They could use a vacation.
JERRY Yea they're taking one, the travel agent is trying to set something else up for them.
ELAINE So how about that Aaron?
JERRY Whew
ELAINE You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that he stood too close to you when he talked?
JERRY No I hadn't noticed.
NEWMAN Pair of bear claws please.
JERRY Hiya Newman.
NEWMAN Hello Jerry.
JERRY Say, I happened to catch you coming out of Schindler's List the other night.
NEWMAN Ohh, were you there?
JERRY Yes I was.
NEWMAN I-it's a it's a...powerful film.
JERRY Yes, shocking brutality don't you think?
NEWMAN Shocking.
JERRY Yes, well that was nothing.
NEWMAN Jerry! Jerry!
GEORGE Where the hell is your father?!
ESTELLE This is the best thing we ever did.
FRANK I just hope those exterminators know what they're doing.
ESTELLE Ah forget about them let's just...
JERRY Personal distance is a very important thing. There's a new personal distance, ATM distance. When someone's using an ATM, you wanna be about six feet back don't you? Because people a little edgy around that ATM don't they? They got their money out, their eyes are darting all around. The other place I wanna be about six feet away is Urinals, you want some distance there too. ATMs and Urinals, I guess whenever someone's taking valuable out of their pants you want to give them as much room as possible.
STATIONER May I help you?
ELAINE Yeah, uh, I'm looking for a Rollamech 1000 mechanical pencil.
STATIONER Oh, I know the Rollamech 1000.
ELAINE No, I'm sure you do.
STATIONER They're pretty expensive.
ELAINE Well, it's for my boss.
STATIONER What do you do?
STATIONER Well, we don't have any in stock right now but I would be happy to order it for you. Just give me your phone number and when it comes in I'll give you a call. You're name is?
ELAINE Elaine.
STATIONER Elaine, . . . and your last name?
ELAINE It's just Elaine, like Cher. Ha ha ha
STATIONER And your number?
ELAINE Uh, aw, KL5-239O.
STATIONER Okay. Thanks a lot. You'll be hearing from me.
ELAINE Okay, Move along. . .
JERRY Why did you give him my number?
ELAINE I think he's got ideas.
JERRY I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?
JERRY Call me when the pencil comes in Okay?
ELAINE Just call me when the new pen comes in, okay?
JERRY Why does Mr. Pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway? Hey. Look who's here.
GEORGE Hey, hey.
ELAINE Hey hey
JULIE Hi Jerry.
JERRY Hi Julie.
GEORGE Elaine, Julie.
ELAINE Hi.
JULIE Hi.
JULIE Oh, hi. Elaine's my middle name.
ELAINE Oh, mine's "Ike".
GEORGE Hey, wanna get some lunch?
JERRY Just had a big bowl of Kix.
GEORGE Ah, well, that's very mature. What about you?
ELAINE Ah, no.
JULIE Please come, Elaine.
ELAINE No, no. How about if you bring me back something?
GEORGE Sure, all right, what do you want?
ELAINE Um, hum, I don't know.. . . A big salad?
GEORGE What big salad? I'm going to the coffee shop.
ELAINE They have big salads.
GEORGE I've never seen a big salad.
ELAINE They have a big salad.
GEORGE Is that what I ask for? The big salad?
ELAINE It's okay, you don't...
GEORGE No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the big salad?
JERRY Big lettuce, big carrots, tomatoes like volleyballs.
GEORGE , we'll see you in a little while.
ELAINE Maybe I should just get married.
JERRY Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?
ELAINE I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell.
JERRY People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.
ELAINE You can say that again.
JERRY It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house.
ELAINE Good for you.
JERRY I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
ELAINE Right on baby.
JERRY What was that?
KRAMER That Gendason, what a jerk. I'm never playing golf with him again.
ELAINE Who Gendason?
KRAMER Steve Gendason.
ELAINE Why is that name familiar?
KRAMER He used to be a baseball player.
ELAINE Oh, how did you end up playing golf with him?
KRAMER Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second shot, when, he picks up the ball and cleans it.
ELAINE So what?
KRAMER Umph, sorry! But the rules clearly state that you cannot clean the ball unless it's on the green. The rules are very clear about that.
JERRY Certainly are.
KRAMER Ya, so I penalized him a stroke. Jx; Ah, so what happened?
KRAMER He lost it! We almost came to blows. We were face to face like a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . .
JERRY All right. You're in my face.
ELAINE I still don't see what the big deal is.
KRAMER A rule is a rule. And let's face it. Without rules there's chaos.
JULIE I like Anna ???'s column and Sapphire. Don't you like Sapphire?
GEORGE Oh, Sapphire. Uh ha
JULIE Although at times can be rather pedantic.
GEORGE He can be pedantic. He can be pedantic.
JULIE And Bob Herbert's great. He's the Daily News.
GEORGE Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No "r" which I find fascinating. You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. "Hebert" it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All right. All right. I got it.
JULIE No, no. I'd like to take you out.
GEORGE No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless.
JULIE Okay, thanks, George.
WAITRESS Here's your big salad to go.
JULIE Oh, thank you.
JERRY Hello. No she's not here. Okay, fine, whatever. I'll tell her. Okay. Goodbye. The stationery store guy called to say he ordered your pencil.
ELAINE I told ya'. He has ideas.
JERRY He doesn't even care if a man answers.
ELAINE Or you.
GEORGE Hey, hey.
ELAINE Hey.
JULIE Sorry e're late.
ELAINE No problem.
JULIE Here's your big salad.
ELAINE Thank you, Julie.
JULIE Oh, you're very welcome. So, I guess I better get going. Gotta meet mother a t the Guggenheim. Sure you don't want to go?
GEORGE No, you go Guggenheim. I'm not much of a Guggenheim.
JULIE Sure, George.
GEORGE Ya, you go.
JULIE Okay, I'll see you later. Goodbye.
JERRY Bye bye
GEORGE Did you see what just happened?
JERRY Well, that all depends. . .
GEORGE Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?
JERRY Yeah, so?
GEORGE Well, she didn't buy the big salad. I bought the big salad.
JERRY Is that a fact?
GEORGE Yes it is. She just took credit for my salad. That's not right.
JERRY No it isn't.
GEORGE I mean I'm the one who bought it.
JERRY Yes you did.
GEORGE You think she should have said something?
JERRY She could have.
GEORGE Oh, I know.
JERRY Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad.
GEORGE You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if they knew it.
JERRY Obviously.
KRAMER Turn on the tv.
JERRY What?
KRAMER I'm puttin it on...
TV . . . the district attorney's office and the police department have not answered any questions as yet. To repeat in case you're just joining us. Former baseball start Steve Genderson, has been taken to Police headquarters for questioning the murder of Bobby Pinkus the owner of Royal Dry Cleaners at 2759 Amsterdam Avenue. According to Pinkus' wife, Gendeson had been involved in a dispute with the cleaner about a stain on a pair of gray Sans-A-Belt slacks. We also have a report that earlier in the day a groundskeeper at Vancourtland's Golf Course saw an irate Gendeson leaving the clubhouse in a huff. Whether there is a possible connection between the two is something we'll just have to wait.
KRAMER Jerry . . .
JERRY Well, it has nothing to do with you.
KRAMER Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner.
JERRY Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that.
ELAINE I like Julie. She's very personable.
GEORGE Yeah, she's very lovely.
ELAINE That's great George.
GEORGE So did you enjoy your lunch?
ELAINE Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha ha Wht?
GEORGE oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though, . . .
ELAINE Even though what?
GEORGE . . . naw, it's just you thanked her, and and oh, . . . what's the difference?
ELAINE What? What are you trying to say, George?
GEORGE It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal.
ELAINE You want the money for the big salad, George?
GEORGE No, no,
ELAINE What is the problem?
GEORGE There is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. Whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big salad.
JERRY And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.
MARGARET Well, they haven't even arrested him yet. Come on, let's go out.
JERRY Ah, no , I don't think so.
MARGARET Why not?
JERRY We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
MARGARET Who is staring?
JERRY Oh, they're staring. They know we're on a date. They're making fun. Come on. It's embarrassing.
JERRY Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That, that's a long story.
JERRY Hello Newman.
MARGARET Hello Jerry, I was wondering if you knew where Kramer was.
JERRY No, no I don't. Why?
MARGARET You know, Genderson. This is something big.
JERRY I suppose.
MARGARET What did Kramer say?
JERRY I don't know. Nothing.?
MARGARET Come on Jerry. You know something tell me! tell me! Oh, chocolates . . . Margaret?
MARGARET Hello.
JERRY You two know each other?
NEWMAN You might say that.
MARGARET We used to go out.
NEWMAN Well, tootle loo. And nice seeing you again Margaret, goodbye Jerry. Have fun. Hehe
JERRY . . . you went out with . . . Newman?
MARGARET Just a few times.
JERRY Why?
MARGARET I liked him.
JERRY You liked, Newman?
MARGARET Look I'm a little uncomfortable talking about this okay?
JERRY No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop seeing him.
MARGARET He ended it.
JERRY . . . he ended it?
MARGARET Yes!! Yes! It was a couple of years ago. Why does it matter?
JERRY No, no of course not.
KRAMER Jerry, Jerry they found a tee.
JERRY What tee?
KRAMER A golf tee. In the dry cleaner.
JERRY Newman! She went out with Newman!
ELAINE It must be a mistake.
JERRY No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that she went out with him but that he stopped seeing her. Do you understand? He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did he, Newman, stop seeing her?
ELAINE Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye.
JERRY No, there's less.
ELAINE It's possible.
JERRY No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil.
ELAINE He's an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle.
JERRY Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie.
WAITRESS Would you like some more coffee?
JERRY No,, but thank you.
JERRY Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got your pencil.
ELAINE Ugh! You are kidding me.
JERRY No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor and got it.
ELAINE I bought mine yesterday on 14th Street.
JERRY Well, what did you do that for? You ordered it.
ELAINE To please Mr. Pitt.
JERRY Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited.
ELAINE Uh, great!
JERRY Hi Julie.
JERRY Hi.
ELAINE Hi Julie.
JERRY Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here.
ELAINE Oh, well then I better get going otherwise George will make me buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday.
JERRY How do you know that?
NEWMAN Who is it.
JERRY It's Jerry.
NEWMAN You've come at a bad time now. Could you come back later?
JERRY Come on Newman. open the door!
NEWMAN Hellooo Jerry. What a rare treat. What brings you down to the east wing?
JERRY Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret?
NEWMAN There's no need to get excited. Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?
JERRY No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little rat's nest. Now, what happened?
NEWMAN Do you really want to know what happened? I'll tell you what Happened. She wasn't my type.
JERRY Noit your type?
NEWMAN Not really.
JERRY Well, how come?
NEWMAN Ah, she just didn't do it for me.
JERRY What, what is wrong with her?
NEWMAN Well, h ha ha- if you're happy with her, that's all that matters.
JERRY You don't think she's attractive?
NEWMAN No. I need a really pretty face. But, Hey, that's me.
JERRY Okay, Newman, thanks a lot.
NEWMAN Care for some lemonade?
JERRY No, thank you.
NEWMAN Drop bye anytime, jerry. Hah, ha ha
KRAMER Listen to this, "If a player cleans his ball during the play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of one stroke. " That's a rule, Jerry.
JERRY But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?
KRAMER Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well I don't have to tell you what happened.
JERRY What are you so worried about this for?
KRAMER You know he talked about Pinkus on the course?
JERRY He did?
KRAMER Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of pants into Pinkus' and they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. And Pinkus denied responsibility. You see he was very upset with Pinkus.
JERRY So it had nothing to do with you.
KRAMER Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge.
JERRY No, I don't think so.
KRAMER Poor Pinkus, poor little Pinkus.
JERRY Hey, let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think Margaret's good looking? Um, she's a natural beauty. Oh, no makeup. I like that.
JERRY Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?
KRAMER Oh, I love curls.
JERRY Yeah,, me too.
KRAMER All right, I'll see you later.
JERRY Where you going?
KRAMER Genderson's.
JERRY You're going to see Genderson?
KRAMER It's weighing on my conscience.
GEORGE You know, I think I could have played with dolls if their were dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't seem like a gender thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. What's so terrible?
JULIE Ha. So, George, I was talking to Elaine before.
GEORGE A ha! We're just friends.
JULIE Yes, well anyway, she said something that was kind of intriguing.
GEORGE Oh, share.
JULIE Well, when I came over to the table she mentioned something about how she better hurry up and leave or you'd make her buy lunch to make up for the one you bought yesterday.
GEORGE Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following that.
JULIE Well, my question is, How could Elaine be under the impression that you bought the big salad, when I was the one who handed it to her?
GEORGE Well, she probably just assumed.
JULIE Um, did she?
GEORGE . . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from me?
JULIE That's what I'm suggesting.
GEORGE . . . well it was a big salad. and what I would like to know is, how does a person who has nothing to do with the big salad claim responsibility for that salad and accept the thank you under false pretenses - ah - ah?
JULIE George, all I did was hand someone a bag.
ELAINE It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil right away.
STATIONER Well,, why did you tell me to order it if you knew you were going to get one someplace else?
ELAINE No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry.
STATIONER I went all the way down to the warehouse. It took me three hours. I had a big fight with the foreman.
ELAINE Really? A fight with the foreman?
STATIONER Yes.
ELAINE Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry.
STATIONER Yeah? Well, then how about going out with me tonight?
ELAINE Okay.
MARGARET I mean they found a tee and he played golf that day. Nobody walks into a dry cleaner's with a tee. The circumstantial evidence is overwhelming.
JERRY You had how many dates with him? Three?
MARGARET Around three. I don't know.
JERRY And . .
MARGARET I told you. He stopped calling me. I moved on. I'm not hung up on him. What are you looking at?
JERRY What? I'm not looking. Nothing.
JERRY Why are you looking at my face?
JERRY Where am I going to look?
MARGARET Kiss me.
JERRY . . . I can't.
JERRY Newman!
JERRY All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman found this unacceptable.
ELAINE Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy.
JERRY You're going out with the stationery store guy?
ELAINE I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no.
ELAINE Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch anymore! You had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought you the big salad. Didn't ya'.
ELAINE Uh, uh.
GEORGE You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything. But you had to have the big salad.
JERRY Hello, what? You're kidding. I'm turning it on. Oh, my god. Get out of here. Hey listen to this. They issued a warrant for Genderson's arrest. He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey Turnpike.
TV As you can see white Bronco. The police have cleared the highway traffic in front of him but they are keeping their distance and don't want the situation to escalate. And we have gotten an identification on the driver of the vehicle. His name is; Kramer, one of Genderson's golfing buddies.
POLICE 9-1-1 What are you reporting
KRAMER Yeah, this is Kramer. I got Genderson in the car. He wants to see his fish. I'm taking him to see his fish. So tell the police to back off.
POLICE Okay, sir, and what's your name?
KRAMER My name is Kramer. You know who I am dammit!
GENDERSON I told you not to take the turnpike.
KRAMER I thought we would blend in.
GENDERSON If we took the palisades this never have happened.
KRAMER we would have had all that bridge traffic.
GENDERSON Ah, just drive.
JERRY Jail doesn't really seem like that great of revenge. Wouldn't years of subtle psychological mind games be a lot more satisfying? Constantly calling him, hanging up when he answers the phone. Sending pizzas and taxis to their house all night long. After a while he would go, "I wish that guy would kill me already, I can't take it anymore." And how come when the police catch some really bad criminal or something they put him in the handcuffs, they hit him with the baton, they put the choke hold on him, then they're always careful they don't want him to hurt his head when they're putting him in the back of the patrol car. "Watch your head, watch your head. Don't hit that metal edge there. . . . That really hurts"
WAITRESS Careful, this plate is extremely hot.
ELAINE Thank you. Ow!
WAITRESS I just told you it was hot. Why'd you touch it?
ELAINE I just wanted to know what your idea of 'hot' is.
PUDDY Hey, babe. You ready to hit the ice?
ELAINE I am ready to skate up a-- ha, ha, ha...Why are you wearing that?
PUDDY It's my winter coat.
ELAINE A fur?
PUDDY Is there a problem?
ELAINE A seemingly infinite supply.
ELAINE Ow! Careful, it's hot.
PUDDY Ow!
JERRY So, Puddy wear's a man fur?
ELAINE He was struttin' around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson.
JERRY And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible.
ELAINE Eh, anti-fur. I mean, who has the energy anymore? This is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot.
GEORGE And this is the first you're seeing of the coat?
ELAINE We never dated in winter.
JERRY You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer.
ELAINE Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day, and I saw that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift.
GEORGE An apartment-warming gift? We got to give presents to people for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like one month off.
JERRY Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's what we're gettin' him.
GEORGE All right, but we're not buyin' it at Bloomingdale's. I will buy it, you pay me back later. I'll sniff out a deal. I have a sixth sense.
JERRY Cheapness is not a sense.
ELAINE I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you keep an eye on the ice, make sure we have enough?' Uh...
JERRY I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the music. I turned that mother out.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER You got any pliers?
JERRY What, has Newman got another army man stuck in his ear?
NEWMAN Hilarious.
KRAMER Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door. So you can see in.
ELAINE Why?
NEWMAN To prevent an ambush.
KRAMER Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies.
JERRY But then anyone can just look in and see you.
KRAMER Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say, 'Enjoy the show.'
ELAINE I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act.
JERRY Hey, George. Here's the model number on that chair, by the way.
KRAMERT Mmm... Nice wallet.
NEWMAN Wallet.
JERRY What?
KRAMER Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of cards and your bankroll. See, keep the big bills on the outside.
JERRY That's a five.
KRAMER I'm on the Mexican, whoa ohh, radio...
SILVIO Eh, what are you doing?
KRAMER Hey, Silvio. Yeah, I'm reversing my peephole.
SILVIO Hey, you know you gotta get permission from me. I'm the super. Who said you could do that?
KRAMER Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place?
SILVIO Like what?
KRAMER Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll, um, I'll switch it back.
SILVIO No, no, no, no. No, that's all right.
KRAMER Well, that's good. Because, uh, Newman and I--
SILVIO Newman? He did this, too?
KRAMER Well, yeah.
SILVIO I deal with him.
GEORGE Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair we're gettin' for Joe Mayo, $60 cheaper.
JERRY Except the store's in Delaware.
GEORGE I'll have 'em overnight it.
JERRY Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without this big wallet. It's more comfortable.
GEORGE It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.
JERRY Why?
GEORGE Because important things go in a case. You got a skull for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for your money.
JERRY But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow here than here.
GEORGE I need everything in there.
JERRY Irish money?
GEORGE I might go there.
JERRY Show this card at any participating Orlando-area Exxon station...to get your free 'Save the Tiger' poster.
GEORGE All right, just gimme that. And gimme some of those Sweet & Lows.
KRAMER Who is it?
NEWMAN It's Newman.
KRAMER What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.
NEWMAN I can't believe I'm being evicted.
KRAMER What? What are you talking about?
NEWMAN The reverse peepholes. Silvio said I'm an agitator and I'm out of the building.
KRAMER No. No, he can't do that.
NEWMAN I'm homeless! I'm gonna be out on a street corner, dancing for nickels. I'll be with the hobos in the trainyard, eating out of a bucket.
KRAMER Come on, we'll go and talk to him, and we'll straighten this thing out.
NEWMAN Uh, you, uh, you better put something on.
JERRY George, I am loving this no wallet thing.
GEORGE A man carries a wallet.
JERRY You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think I'm onto something.
JOE_MAYO Hey, Jerry.
JERRY Hey, Joe Mayo. Nice place.
JOE_MAYO Thanks. George, can you do me a favor and stay by the phone in case anybody calls and needs directions?
GEORGE Love to.
JOE_MAYO Thanks. Jerry...
JERRY Music?
JOE_MAYO Actually, can you keep an eye on the aquarium and make sure nobody taps on the glass?
JERRY But I could do that and the music.
JOE_MAYO Oh, no, don't worry about the music. Just... have fun!
JERRY I was ready to get jiggy with it.
PUDDY Hey.
JERRY Hey, Elaine.
ELAINE Hey. I think you know Dr... Zaius.
JERRY So, Elaine, notice anything different about my... pants?
ELAINE So, George... did you get the chair?
GEORGE No, I don't have it yet.
JERRY So, we're givin' him nothing?
GEORGE No, I brought a picture of the chair.
JERRY Did you at least get him a card?
GEORGE I thought we'd all sign the picture.
JOE_MAYO Elaine...
ELAINE Hey, Joe Mayo.
JOE_MAYO I need you to be in charge of coats.
ELAINE Oh, fantastic.
JOE_MAYO And Puddy, can you make sure no one puts a drink on my...sound system?
PUDDY Sure thing, Joe Mayo.
JERRY Hi, I'm Jerry. How do you like my pants?
KERI Nice.
JERRY It's working. Don't tap on the glass.
GEORGE Joe Mayo's apartment?
PUDDY Hey! Cocktail off the speaker.
ELAINE Goodbye, Dr. Zaius.
SILVIO Why are we in Jerry's apartment?
KRAMER Well, I, uh, I like to think of this as my conference room. Yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves, and the furniture.
SILVIO Make it quick Kramer, my wife and I are about to go bowling.
KRAMER Oh, well, um, Newman thinks that you, uh, evicted him?
SILVIO I did. I don't like Mr. Newman. He is an agitator.
KRAMER Look... I've known Newman all my life, in the building, and you're all wrong about him. He's a model tenant. Portly, yes, but smart as a whip.
SILVIO OK, on your word he can stay.
KRAMER All right.
SILVIO But... I'm gonna keep my eye on him.
KRAMER Well, you won't regret it.
SILVIO What's wrong?
JOE_MAYO Elaine, thanks for coming.
ELAINE Good working with you.
PUDDY All right, let's hit the bricks.
ELAINE What?
JOE_MAYO Hey, I got a coat just like this!
ELAINE Oh. Uhhh...
ELAINE So Joe Mayo had the same coat.
GEORGE And you threw it out the window?
ELAINE Mm-hmm.
GEORGE God, you're like a rock star.
ELAINE So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.
JERRY Because you threw it out.
ELAINE No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane.
JERRY But you did actually throw his coat out the window.
ELAINE But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible.
JERRY But that's you.
ELAINE So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway.
GEORGE Well, I'm satisfied. Uh...my back is...killing me.
JERRY Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass.
GEORGE This...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend.
ELAINE Look at you. You're on a slant.
GEORGE Here, just give me a couple of napkins.
GEORGE There, there I'm fine.
JERRY What was that?
GEORGE I think I had some hard candy in there.
GEORGE No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment.
GEORGE Ahhh. How does this thing work?
GEORGE Ahhhhh...
DELIVERY_MAN Sir, do you want me to deliver this to your friend's place or not?
GEORGE Ahhhhh...
KERI Ready to go?
JERRY All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing.
KERI You don't go that often?
JERRY No, because it's so stupid. Shall we?
KERI Do me a favor. Can you hold this stuff for me?
JERRY Compact, lipstick, all this?
KERI And can you help to carry my keys?
JERRY What are you, a medieval dungeon master?
KERI And a tin of altoids.
JERRY Ow! Sharp key.
KRAMER So, you're sleeping with Silvio's wife?
NEWMAN Well, there's very little sleeping going on.
KRAMER Well, why didn't you tell me about this?
NEWMAN Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business.
KRAMER Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man, if he catches you, we're both out.
NEWMAN Hey, what is that up that tree?
KRAMER Hoooh! Man, that looks like a dead bear.
NEWMAN No, that's a fur coat! Hey, uh, give me a boost.
KRAMER Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?
NEWMAN The Pacific Northwest.
ELAINE So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal.
JERRY You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet, and I want to keep that weight off.
ELAINE You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would be perfect for you.
JERRY Not more of that crap from the Titanic?
ELAINE No. No. It's a small men's carryall.
JERRY I'm not carrying a purse.
ELAINE It's not a purse. It's European.
JERRY Oh.
ELAINE Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?
JERRY I don't know.
ELAINE If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a gift, too.
GEORGE Yeah?
JERRY Hey, George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?
GEORGE Not yet. Oh! Ho ho! God...
JERRY What?
GEORGE It's in... transit.
ELAINE Did he get it?
JERRY No.
ELAINE Mmm, good. Tell him I'm out.
GEORGE What, she's out?
JERRY Well, so what? You're gettin' a deal, right? We'll split it three ways.
GEORGE Allllll right!
JERRY What is that noise?
JERRY You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me.
KRAMER Hey. Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, here are your pliers back....Weak hinge.
ELAINE Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats.
KRAMER Oh, go down to 88th Street. They're free.
ELAINE What are you talking about?
KRAMER Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed lemur!
ELAINE 88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat!
JERRY What was that pop sound?
KRAMER Well, I had some hard candy in there.
NEWMAN So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?
ELAINE Come in, come in.
NEWMAN Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place.
ELAINE Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about something.
NEWMAN This isn't about my opening your mail?
ELAINE What?
NEWMAN Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already open.
ELAINE Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of mine, and I'd like to give it back to him.
NEWMAN Sorry. Climbers, keepers.
ELAINE You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered.
NEWMAN You are?
ELAINE Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the only one who's held down a steady job for several years.
NEWMAN Well, it's-it's interesting work, I don't mind it.
ELAINE Ha ha ha ha.
NEWMAN Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type?
ELAINE Uh, don't worry, he's cool.
NEWMAN Cool?
ELAINE Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little favor, Newmie?
NEWMAN Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart belongs to another man's wife, and I have given the coat to her.
ELAINE All right, we're done here.
NEWMAN For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of the apartment, where I would be dancing on the sidewalk--
ELAINE Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.
KERIL Nice carryall.
JERRY It's European.
KERI Do you still have my lipstick?
JERRY Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't he? So what was your job?
KERI My job was to keep you away from the music.
JERRY What, he doesn't like my taste in music?
KERI Guess not.
JERRY You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!
SILVIO Kramer! It's Silvio! Open up, I need to talk to you! I can see you through the reverse peephole.
KRAMER Hey, Silvio!
SILVIO Look at this.
KRAMER Huh?
SILVIO Svetlana says she find it in the laundry room, but I think it is a gift from that postman agitator. Where is he?
KRAMER Relax, Silvio.
SILVIO No, that's it. You're both out of the building!
KRAMER Oh, come on! Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! No, that's not even a woman's coat. It's a man's!
SILVIO A man's?
KRAMER Yeah.
SILVIO What kind of a man would wear fur?
KRAMER Oh, lots of 'em.
SILVIO Would you?
KRAMER No.
SILVIO Then who?
KRAMER What about Jerry?
SILVIO Jerry?
KRAMER Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot of furs. They're desperate, insecure people.
SILVIO Yes, you are right. It's all about, me, me, me. Please, look at me! I am so pretty! Love me! Want me!
KRAMER Yeah, something like that.
JERRY I have to do what?
KRAMER All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's yours.
JERRY I'm not wearing the fur.
KRAMER Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building.
JERRY Is that right?
KRAMER All right, why don't you just take a good, hard look at what your life will be like if I'm not around?
JERRY Newman, too?
KRAMER Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about.
JERRY That's my walkman!
KRAMER And you'll get it back.
JERRY All right.
KRAMER All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one.
GEORGE Hey.
KRAMER Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when you gave it to me.
JERRY George, did you get that chair yet?
GEORGE It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?
JERRY You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.
GEORGE Excuse me?
JERRY Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' a gift from me.
GEORGE Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer and I have to pay for the entire gift?
KRAMER Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking about?
GEORGE He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember? It was your suggestion.
KRAMER I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up.
GEORGE Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?
JERRY No, you don't have to buy anything.
GEORGE I already bought it! I've been lyin' to you for three days, and now you're all screwin' me!
JERRY I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?
GEORGE I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked.
JERRY Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!
GEORGE Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair, and it will be easy, because the receipt is in my good friend.
JERRY Your good friend is morbidly obese.
GEORGE Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.
JERRY It's not a purse. It's European!
KRAMER All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk. Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner, you pick up a paper, and you come right back.
JERRY All right.
KRAMER There you go.
JERRY How do I look?
KRAMER Ahh....
GEORGE Learn guitar, first lesson free? Huh.
GEORGE My receipts! The chair! My tiger poster!
JERRY Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat.
SILVIO That is your coat?
JERRY It sure is.
SILVIO Kramer says you need it because you're an entertainer and you're desperate for attention.
JERRY That's true.
KRAMER Jerry, you forgot your purse.
JERRY Oh, thanks.
KRAMER Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his coat with his purse. Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy.
JERRY Maybe this isn't my coat.
KRAMER All right, you're not fancy!
SILVIO No, he's very fancy! Want me, love me! Shower me with kisses!
ELAINE Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat.
JERRY No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy.
ELAINE No, that's not your coat.
SILVIO If that is not his coat, whose coat is it?
ELAINE It's Joe Mayo's coat.
SILVIO Who's Joe Mayo?
KRAMER That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.
JERRY Hey! Officer! Someone took my European carryall!
COP Your what?
JERRY The...black, leather...thing with a strap.
COP You mean a purse?
JERRY Yes, a purse. I carry a purse!
JERRY So, Silvio ambushed Joe Mayo?
ELAINE Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with a sock full of pennies.
JERRY He should have had a reverse peephole.
PUDDY Hey, Babe.
JERRY Hello? Hello?
ELAINE What is that?
PUDDY It's my new coat.
ELAINE You ditched the fur?
PUDDY Yeah, I saw Jerry wearing his. He looked like a bit of a dandy. Check it out! 8-Ball! You got a question, you ask the 8-Ball.
ELAINE You're gonna wear this all the time?
PUDDY All signs point to 'Yes!'
JERRY I've always been a big fan of the little check move. You know. Unless the waiter's not too sharp, then you got to total it up. Sometimes they have to come over, "Do you want the check?" "No, I want to be pen pals. Can't you see what I'm doing here? I'm trying to be cool and impress people."
ELAINE Hmm!
GEORGE Fantastic!
JERRY I told you. How good is this?
GEORGE Good.
JERRY How good?
GEORGE Very good.
ELAINE They got blue berries. And there's real blue berries. What kind did you get?
JERRY Coffee. And they grind up the coffee beans, and they put it in.
ELAINE Let me test-taste that.
JERRY Huh? Huh?
ELAINE Hmm! Rico!
JERRY Suave! And it's non-fat!
GEORGE See, how could this not have any fat? It's too good.
ELAINE You want to taste mine?
GEORGE Oh, you want to taste mine.
ELAINE No, I don't.
GEORGE Okay, if you want to taste mine, you don't have to offer me some of yours.
ELAINE All right, let's just forget it.
JERRY You know, Kramer's going to clean up on this place.
GEORGE What do you mean?
JERRY He invested in it.
GEORGE No kidding?
JERRY Yeah. We've been coming here everyday. This is so beeping good.
LADY Jerry!
JERRY Oh, I'm sorry.
ELAINE All right, we should get going. But, I'm going to get a little bit more, okay?
GEORGE Oh, god. Look who's here.
JERRY Who is it?
GEORGE This guy from my old neighborhood. Lloyd: Braun. He's a big advisor to Mayor Dinkins. He thinks he's so cool.
JERRY Oh, really?
LLOYD Hey, George!
GEORGE Hey! Lloyd! My friend Jerry.
LLOYD So, I hear you're living back home now?
GEORGE Yeah, there was a fire in my apartment.
LLOYD Fire! Whoa! There's a lot of major chicks in this place, huh? Something wrong with your arm?
GEORGE Uh, uh, yeah. Actually, the, uh, I bumped my elbow on a desk and injured something. And now it sort of moves involuntarily.
LLOYD Wow, that's a bitch, huh?
LLOYD So, how are your parents doing?
GEORGE Oh, pretty good.
LLOYD This place does some business, huh?
GEORGE Yeah, this is my first time here.
LLOYD Hey, she's a doll.
ELAINE Hi!
GEORGE Uh, Elaine, this is, uh, Lloyd.
ELAINE Hi!
LLOYD Oh, hi! Very nice to meet you.
ELAINE Nice to meet you, too!
LLOYD Well, I'm really sorry I got to run now. Well, take it easy, huh, George?
GEORGE Yeah! Yeah.
ELAINE Boy, he is really cute!
GEORGE He's a jerk.
JERRY He's gone, George.
GEORGE All right. All right.
KRAMER So, there were a lot of people there, huh?
JERRY Oh, man, that yogurt place - you're going to make a fortune.
KRAMER Yeah.
JERRY They're doing an incredible business.
KRAMER Yeah, well, I told you to go in on it.
JERRY How did you know?
KRAMER Well, I tasted it at the one downtown. It's got a remarkable texture. You'd never know it was non-fat.
JERRY Yeah?
ELAINE Buzz me.
JERRY Oh. Hey, I had the show of my life last night. I ad-libbed like ten new minutes.
KRAMER Yeah, but did you tape it?
JERRY Right there. I got it. I did this thing on the Ottoman Empire. Like, what was this? A whole empire based on putting your feet up?
KRAMER Yes!
JERRY I'm telling you, I got like a whole new Tonight Show here.
ELAINE Hey!
KRAMER Hey!
JERRY What's the matter?
ELAINE Oh, I was having lunch, and I bit down on the fork.
JERRY Boy, it's hard to believe - with all that biting experience - a person could still make a mistake like that.
KRAMER Yow!
ELAINE What?
KRAMER Well, you're getting heavy. Yeah, you look like you put on five, ten pounds.
JERRY Kramer!
KRAMER I'll tell you something else, you're looking a little chunky yourself, buddy.
JERRY Me?
KRAMER Yeah.
JERRY No.
ELAINE Where's your bathroom scale? Oh my god, I've gained seven pounds.
JERRY I've gained eight.
KRAMER I told you.
ELAINE Oh, my god! A couple, but 7 pounds. How did I gain 7 pounds?
JERRY How did I gain eight?
ELAINE I don't get it. I, I've been doing the same exercises. I haven't been eating anything different.
JERRY Me, either. Wait a second. Wait a second. Maybe it's that yogurt.
KRAMER No, no, no. That's hundred percent yogurt.
JERRY Well, how else could this have happened?
KRAMER Well, maybe it's the Oreos.
ELAINE I don't eat Oreos.
KRAMER You don't eat Oreos? The way you break them open? You're ~ practically having sex with them.
JERRY What about me?
KRAMER You? You're getting old.
JERRY Maybe your yogurt isn't so non-fat.
KRAMER Oh, guess again, Tubby!
ELAINE Jerry, there's got to be a way to find that out.
JERRY There must be some kind of lab that would do that kind of thing.
ELAINE Gasp! I've got it.
KRAMER What?
ELAINE I'll call the Food and Drug Administration.
KRAMER Hey, I'll tell you what, Chubby, if that yogurt has fat in it, I will put myself on an all-yogurt diet for a week.
JERRY Well, let's start the insanity.
KRAMER Giddy-up! Dad Tommy Tune is a very good dancer. You ever see Tommy Tune dancing?
GEORGE No.
MOM I like tap dancing. Dad Tap dancing. Anyone can tap dance. It's all in those shoes.
MOM Are you kidding? They practice for years, those people.
GEORGE What's for supper?
MOM Somebody's at the door. Dad Tommy Tune is very tall. That helps. It makes him lankier.
MOM Lloyd?
LLOYD Hello, Mrs. Costanza.
MOM Georgie, Lloyd: Braun is here. Dad Hey! Lloyd!
MOM What are you doing here?
LLOYD Well, I was just in the neighborhood visiting my mother, and so I thought I'd drop by and say, "Hello".
MOM Georgie. Come here and say hello. Dad How are you doing, Lloyd? I hear you're a big advisor for Dinkins now.
LLOYD That's right. Hey, George.
GEORGE Hey, Lloyd. How's it going?
LLOYD I ran into George: yesterday in the city.
MOM Ow! What's the matter with you?
LLOYD So, uh, how's the arm, huh?
GEORGE Oh, it's good. It's good.
MOM What's the matter with your arm?
GEORGE Nothing.
LLOYD Oh, his arm moves like this. Dad Your arm moves like this?
GEORGE Yeah. Dad I never seen your arm move like this.
MOM Me, either.
GEORGE Well, it comes and goes. Dad It's like some kind of a spasm.
LLOYD Ooh! I asked Mr. Dinkins if he knew any good orthopedists, and he said he had the best. So, I made an appointment for you. Dr. Dekter.
MOM Mayor Dinkins got an appointment for him? Dad You mentioned George's name to Mayor Dinkins? You discussed George with the mayor of New York?
MOM Dinkins was talking about you. He was discussing you.
GEORGE You know, Lloyd, I've been to the doctor - there's really nothing they can do. Dad Hey, Mayor Dinkins set this up for you. You know what kind of a doctor this must be if Dinkins knows him?
GEORGE All right. All right. I'll go.
LLOYD Well, that's great. And, uh, I'll be very interested to hear the diagnosis.
ELAINE Uh-huh. Okay, well, we're coming down. All right. Okay. I got a place that can analyze it. It's in Brooklyn. We have to drive there.
JERRY And they said they can do it?
ELAINE Yeah, it's forty-five bucks.
JERRY All right. Let's go down to the yogurt store, and we'll get a specimen.
ELAINE Hm-hmm. Lady Well, I hope you're satisfied.
JERRY What? Lady Every word out of my son's mouth now is beep, beep, beep. You know what he said to me five minutes ago? Where's my beeping cupcake?
JERRY Gee, I'm really sorry. Lady He wants to be like you because you're a comedian. Maybe you could talk to him?
JERRY I'd be happy to. Lady Thank you.
JERRY Ah, Mary, we've been eating a lot of your husband's yogurt at the yogurt place - does that have any fat in it? Lady No beeping way!
LLOYD Well, it was very nice seeing you again.
MOM Oh, it was good seeing you.
LLOYD Oh, um, by the way, who was that gorgeous woman I saw you with the other day?
GEORGE Oh, uh, just a friend of mine.
MOM You must mean Elaine. Isn't she adorable?
LLOYD She is. She is. How about giving me her number?
GEORGE Oh, you know, Lloyd, I really don't have it.
MOM She works at Pendant Publishing. Elaine: Benice.
LLOYD Oh, great. Thanks a lot!
GEORGE Yeah!
LLOYD So long.
MOM Bye! Oh, that Lloyd: Braun. He is something, isn't he? Newman Well, I wouldn't hear of it. I said, "Nice try, granny!" And I sent her to the back of the line!
JERRY Hello, Newman. Newman Hello, Jerry. Say, this yogurt is really something, huh? And it's non-fat! I've been waiting for something like this my whole life! And it's finally here! Owner Hey, Seinfeld. I'd appreciate it if you'd stop using obscenities around my son, huh?
JERRY It was an accident. I'm going to talk to him.
ELAINE I want a small, plain vanilla in a cup to go. That's non-fat, right? Owner That's right.
ELAINE 'Cause I'm on a special diet, and the doctor said I can't have any fat. Owner Yeah, well, there is no fat. Newman Hey, another round of strawberry for me and my friends.
ELAINE Hurry, Jerry! Hurry!
JERRY How's it doing?
ELAINE Not too good.
KRAMER Well, you can't have this tested now. It's melting.
JERRY So what.
KRAMER It changes the molecules.
JERRY Oh, you don't know what you're talking about.
KRAMER Hey, fatso! I got a 90 in biology.
JERRY You call me fatso one more time; you're going to be walking back.
ELAINE Um, hi! Hi. I called earlier about getting the yogurt tested. Labbie Oh, right. Would you fill this out, please?
ELAINE Yeah. Oh, does it matter if it's melted? Labbie No! You know, this is going to take a couple of days.
ELAINE That's okay.
KRAMER Hello, there.
LABBETTE Hello!
KRAMER Ooh! Test tubes. Cool!
JERRY What do you got there? Labbie Actually, this is Mr. Giuliani's blood. We're doing a cholesterol work up on it.
JERRY Oh.
ELAINE Okay, I'm done.
LABBETTE It was really nice meeting you.
KRAMER Well, the pleasure's all mine.
JERRY You can't take that chemist out.
KRAMER Why not?
JERRY Because she's like the jury. She's going to be sequestered.
KRAMER I'm not taking her out just to influence the results.
JERRY Well, I think the whole thing stinks.
ELAINE It smells. Smells bad. Smells really bad.
JERRY That's enough.
ELAINE What?
JERRY Well, with the smells.
GEORGE So, he made an appointment for me to see Dinkins' doctor. He's just trying to humiliate me.
JERRY Uh-huh.
GEORGE And I have to go. If I don't go, he'll know I'm lying.
JERRY Well, so, what are you going to do? Sit in the doctor's office doing this? He's going to think you're a mental patient.
GEORGE I don't care. Look, Lloyd: doesn't know what he's up against. This is nothing to me. My whole life is a lie.
ELAINE Hey! G&J Hey.
ELAINE So, guess who called me.
GEORGE Oh, don't tell me. Lloyd?
ELAINE We're going out tomorrow night.
GEORGE Oh, look, he's going to ask you about my arm. So, just tell him I banged it against a desk. And it's been moving involuntarily ever since.
ELAINE I can't say that.
GEORGE Why not?
ELAINE What if I like him? I'm going to start out lying to this guy?
GEORGE So, you're taking his side?
ELAINE No. But what if we get married or something? We'll always have that between us.
GEORGE Already you're marrying this guy?
ELAINE You never know.
GEORGE All right, believe me, you're not going to marry him.
ELAINE All right, well, then what if we become a couple, George? Every time we see you you're going to be walking around going like this? Even you can't keep that up.
JERRY No, I believe he can. Lady Hi!
JERRY Hi! Lady You know Jerry. Son Of course, he's the funny beeper. Lady See!
JERRY Listen, Matthew, I want to explain something to you. Now, cursing is not something that most comedians do. Son You did it.
JERRY That's true. But it was an accident. And I haven't done it since. And I would never do it again. And if you continue cursing, you'll never become a comedian like me when you grow up. Excuse me one second.
ELAINE You know, Lloyd: advises Dinkins on everything he does.
GEORGE Yeah, yeah. Big advisor.
ELAINE He tells him which soap to use.
JERRY What the beep are you doing? You little piece of beep.
LABBETTE Shh! We don't want to disturb the security guard.
KRAMER Where's the lights. Whoa!
LABBETTE How about this?
KRAMER Yeah! Bunsen burner. You want a taste? It's Cappuccino.
LABBETTE It's delicious.
KRAMER I hear you.
LABBETTE Non-fat?
KRAMER Well, you tell me. Is the verdict in yet?
LABBETTE No.
KRAMER Well, this is in case there's a tie!
ELAINE Well, as far as I know, he bumped his arm into a door and it's kind of got this involuntarily movement. Some sort of a spasm. So, anyway, you're a big advisor to Dinkins, huh?
LLOYD Yeah, yeah. It's coming right down to the wire.
ELAINE Wow! You know what I would do if I was running for mayor. One of my campaign themes would be that everybody should wear name tags all the time to make the city friendlier.
LLOYD Name tags, hmm?
ELAINE Well, everybody would know everybody. It would be like a small town.
LLOYD Maybe I'll mention that to him.
ELAINE Really? Wow!
LLOYD You sure you don't want any yogurt?
ELAINE No, I'm watching my weight.
LLOYD Well, it's nonfat.
ELAINE Yeah, so they say.
LLOYD Well, should we go?
ELAINE Yeah. Okay.
ELAINE Three days and he hasn't called me, and you know why? Because he thinks I'm too fat.
JERRY He said that?
ELAINE No, but I saw the look on his face when he put his arm around me. And then we went to his apartment, and I sat on one of his chairs and it broke. And he says, "Boy, you're a lot of woman!"
KRAMER Hey! So, hear anything on the yogurt?
JERRY No, but I expect to hear anytime.
KRAMER Well, I wouldn't get your hopes up.
JERRY Why do you say that?
KRAMER No reason. Oh, did you hear about that Dinkins?
ELAINE No. What about him?
KRAMER You didn't hear?
ELAINE Un-huh.
KRAMER He's proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear name tags.
JERRY Name tags?
KRAMER Yeah! So people can go around saying "hello" to one another.
JERRY Oh, I see. So you can go, "Hey, you know who I saw wilding today? Herb!"
KRAMER He's become the laughing stock! You know The Times has already stated it could cost him the election. Name tags!
JERRY Hello? Yes. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh, really? Okay, thank you very much. Bye-bye. Well, the yogurt verdict is in. Fat!
KRAMER Yeow!
GEORGE The next morning, I woke up, and it was going like this. I can control it if I really concentrate. But otherwise, oh!
DOCTOR Yes, well, I'm going to have to be perfectly honest with you.
GEORGE Please, doctor.
DOCTOR I've examined you.
GEORGE Yes.
DOCTOR I've looked at your X-rays.
GEORGE Uh-huh.
DOCTOR And I find that there's absolutely nothing wrong with you.
GEORGE Hmm. Really? Nothing?
DOCTOR Nothing that would indicate involuntary spasms.
GEORGE Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?
DOCTOR No, not really.
GEORGE How so?
DOCTOR May I suggest the possibility that you're faking?
GEORGE Faking? What makes you think that I have time to see doctors, take X-rays, make appointments, when there's absolutely nothing wrong with me? What kind of a person would do a thing like that?
DOCTOR I don't know what kind of a person would do something like that. Obviously a very sick person. A very immature person. A person who has no regard for wasting other people's valuable time. Good-bye.
GEORGE Now, see here, doctor.
DOCTOR I said, good-bye.
GEORGE Fine. Ow!
ELAINE Jerry, come on, look. Let's go over to that yogurt store.
JERRY Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this. This has got to be a massive conspiracy. Who knows how deep it goes. Hey, look, wait a second, Kramer, turn that up.
KRAMER Okay.
NEWS Rudy Giuliani, who underwent a physical last week, received some startling news today when his cholesterol count turned out to be a whopping 375. What effect this will have on the minds of the voters remains to be seen. In another development, Mayor Dinkins has fired his top advisor, Lloyd Braun, who is believed to be responsible for the name tag fiasco. We now take you to Giuliani headquarters where Rudy Giuliani is about to make a statement.
GIULIANI It's hard to understand. Because I've been doing everything I normally do. I've been watching my diet very carefully. I exercise regularly. My only indulgence, I guess, would be that I eat a lot of frozen yogurt. But it's non-fat.
JERRY Yogurt? Oh, my god. They got Giuliani and he doesn't even know it.
ELAINE Now look what you've done.
JERRY Well, we've got to do something. I'm calling Giuliani's headquarters.
GEORGE Name tags! Name tags! What kind of an idiot thinks anybody would be interested in an idea like that. Dad I don't think it's so bad. People should wear name tags. Everyone would be a lot friendlier. "Hello, Sam." "How are you doing, Joe?" Hey, your arm. It moved again. I thought you said it went away.
GEORGE I banged it on the desk in the doctor's office. And . . .
MOM Be quiet. They're starting the press conference. Giuliani My campaign staff has received some very disturbing information regarding the fat content in yogurt that's being sold throughout the city. I pledge to you now, that if I'm elected mayor, as my first order of business I'll appoint a special task force to investigate this matter. I promise you, my fellow New Yorkers, that Mayor Giuliani will do everything possible to cleanse this city of this falsified non-fat yogurt.
JERRY The old yogurt was so much better. Oh, this is terrible.
GEORGE Phew!
ELAINE Oh, it stinks.
KRAMER Mine, too. I got one more day.
JERRY I can't eat this. Newman Hey, Jerry. Thanks a lot. I hope you're happy.
JERRY It had fat in it, it's not good for you. Newman I don't care. It was good. I was enjoying it. Had to interfere. Couldn't leave well enough alone. Well, I will get even with you for this. You can count on it.
ELAINE Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen to this. Apparently some blood spilled into Mr. Giuliani's test tube causing his cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially reported. Ironically, the mishap by bringing the non-fat yogurt scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched the election for the Republican. It was the one issue which seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into office.
JERRY So, in effect, the yogurt won him the election.
ELAINE I wonder what actually happened in that lab.
KRAMER Yeah, me, too. Newman I can't eat this.
BOY Thanks for ruining my daddy's business, you fat beep!
JERRY I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and this says what about you? "Well, I can't afford to just throw money down the toilet, but look how close I am!"
JERRY I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that "Breakfast at Tiffany's" thing.
GEORGE I think she finds my stupidity charming.
JERRY As we all do.
GEORGE Yeah, anyway, she's uh, having some kind of a family lunch, I'll swing by after.
JERRY Oh, so you're gonna meet the mother?
GEORGE Yeah, I'll zip in, "How do you do?", zip out. She'll love me.
JERRY You're good with the mothers.
GEORGE Y'know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters.
JERRY Maybe you should date the mothers.
GEORGE Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then I'd really have something goin'.
JERRY Oh, you got something goin'.
GEORGE Yeah.
KRAMER Hey.
GEORGE Hey!
KRAMER Hey, you got a hammer?
JERRY What do you need a hammer for?
KRAMER Well, I got this new poster. 3-D art? Computers generate 'em.
JERRY Oh, yeah! I wanna see that. Bring it over.
KRAMER No, no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, you wanna take a ride?
JERRY Nah, I don't think so.
KRAMER George, you wanna go for a ride?
GEORGE Nah.
KRAMER Oh, come on!
JERRY Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?
KRAMER All right, I've had it with you two.
JERRY Hey, guess what? Remember that woman you saw me with the other day? You know, she used to be an Olympic gymnast?
KRAMER A gymnast!
JERRY Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics.
KRAMER A gymnast, Jerry. Think of the flexibility. Mmm, that sex'll melt your face.
JERRY Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing.
KRAMER "Bailing"?
JERRY Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just a sexual dalliance.
KRAMER Jerry, you should pay that price.
JERRY She's Romanian. What am I gonna talk to her about, Ceausescu?
KRAMER Ch- oo-... what?
GEORGE A gymnast! I can't believe it, you didn't tell me she was a gymnast.
JERRY What is this?
GEORGE What, I'm puttin' my shirt back on.
JERRY "Back on"? What was it doing off?
GEORGE I take it off when I go to the, uh, y'know, to the "office".
JERRY What for?
GEORGE Well, it frees me up. No encumbrances.
JERRY Unbuttoned, or all the way off?
GEORGE All the way, baby!
JERRY Of course.
KRAMER Yeow! Whoa.
JERRY What, again? Kramer, if you keep getting these attacks, you should see the doctor and have it checked out.
KRAMER Yeah, yeah, yeah...
JERRY You always take the shirt off?
GEORGE Always.
JERRY Boy, I tell ya', knowing you is like going out in the jungle. I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared.
MR._PITT Elaine, I need you to proofread this report for my meeting with the Poland Creek Bottled Water people.
ELAINE What meeting?
MR._PITT I told you. I sit on the Board of Trustees for Morgan Springs, and we're trying to acquire Poland Creek.
ELAINE Oh!
MR._PITT Are you using a fountain pen?
ELAINE Yes?
MR._PITT They smear! Under no circumstances is ink to be used in this office.
ELAINE All right! I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt.
KRAMER Elaine?
ELAINE Come in, come in!
KRAMER Yeah. Yah, huh?
ELAINE Ah, right there, yeah.
KRAMER Yeah, that's...
ELAINE Kramer, it's...
KRAMER : There she blows!
ELAINE Kramer, Kramer, can you do this at home? I've got, I've got work to do, okay?
KRAMER Oh, these are nice corners, huh?
MR._PITT Elaine, did I hear... Oh, this is very odd.
KRAMER Yeah, it's 3-D art. Computers generate 'em. Big computers.
MR._PITT Yes, I've heard about these. How do they work?
KRAMER Well, you blur your eyes like you're starin' straight through the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then... Oh, oh, oh, Yeah!
MR._PITT I don't see it.
KRAMER Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids...
MR._PITT I still don't see it.
ELAINE Okay, Kramer, that's enough. Mr. Pitt has got work to do.
KRAMER Ya' ever dream in 3-D? It's like the boogeyman is comin' right at you.
MR._PITT A spaceship, where?
KRAMER Right in here. Just keep your eyes unfocused. Waahh! Oh, mama!
ELAINE Kramer, what's wrong?
KRAMER Mama!
ELAINE Kramer, Kramer, are you okay?
KRAMER I think I gotta go to the doctor! Oh, mama!
MR._PITT How long does it usually take?
MRS._ENRIGHT Oh, George, it is so nice to finally meet you. And I'm sorry we've kept Lindsay so long.
LINDSAY Mother...
GEORGE Oh, no, no, not at all. No, I have always felt that the most important thing in the world is spending time with family.
MRS._ENRIGHT Oh? Are you and your family close?
GEORGE Very close, yes. Almost painfully close.
LINDSAY Mother, I'm going to walk Nana and Aunt Phyllis to the elevator. George, do you mind waiting just one more minute?
GEORGE Mind? Why would I mind? I would love to wait! Nana, nice to see you. Ni-ni-ni-ni-Nana! Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure. What a pleasure! Hey, let's do this again real soon. I had fun, huh?
MRS._ENRIGHT Can I offer you anything to eat?
GEORGE Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh?
MRS._ENRIGHT Oh no, George, you don't have to...
GEORGE No, I know I don't have to, I want to.
MRS._ENRIGHT George, you are such a gentleman.
GEORGE I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright. Here we go, all right.
MRS._ENRIGHT Oh...
GEORGE : Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
ELAINE Look, there's a spaceship! That is so cool!
MR._PITT Where is it?
ELAINE Right here.
MR._PITT I'm looking there!
ELAINE No, no, unfocus.
MR._PITT I am unfocused!
ELAINE Hello? Oh, yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right down. Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting.
MR._PITT Meeting?
ELAINE Yeah, the Poland Creek merger?
MR._PITT Why don't you go for me?
ELAINE How can I go?
MR._PITT Oh, all they're gonna do is read the report.
ELAINE Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea.
MR._PITT Oh, DAMN this thing!
JERRY So, Ceausescu. He must've been some dictator.
KATYA Oh yes. He was not shy about dictating.
JERRY He, uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning. "I want a cup of coffee and a muffin!"
KATYA And you could not refuse.
JERRY No, you'd have to be crazy.
KATYA He was a very bad dictator.
JERRY Yes. Very bad. Very, very bad.
JERRY So lemme get this straight: you find yourself in the kitchen. You see an eclair, in the receptacle. And you think to yourself, "What the hell, I'll just eat some trash."
GEORGE No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!
JERRY Was it in the trash?
GEORGE Yes.
JERRY Then it was trash.
GEORGE It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top.
JERRY But it was in the cylinder!
GEORGE Above the rim.
JERRY Adjacent to refuse, is refuse.
GEORGE It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.
JERRY Was it eaten?
GEORGE One little bite.
JERRY Well, that's garbage.
GEORGE But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt!
JERRY Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and Bum. You are now a Bum.
JERRY Hey!
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY What's with you?
KRAMER I got a stone.
JERRY What stone?
KRAMER A kidney stone.
JERRY What is that, anyway?
KRAMER It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the ureter into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!
JERRY Oh, that's gotta hurt.
ARONSON Our shareholders have given basic approval for the merger, including the stock swap.
ELAINE Ah. The "stock swap". Let's swap some stock.
BECK And if you'll just give this to Mr. Pitt, and tell him we expect to be in full-scale production by the spring.
ELAINE All right. Hey, you guys--what's the name of the new company gonna be?
BECK Moland Spring.
ELAINE "Moland"?
ARONSON Yes, we combined Morgan and Poland.
ELAINE Yeah, I know, but... "Moland"? I wouldn't drink anything called "Moland".
ARONSON But it was Mr. Pitt's idea.
ELAINE Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?
ARONSON We've got to do something about that name.
GEORGE No, Lindsay, it was not in the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage all the time. It was no big thing. That's right. Oh, okay. Buh-bye. I'm back in, she gave me a second chance.
JERRY Good for you.
GEORGE Yes, good for me!
JERRY Y'know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it out.
GEORGE Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist!
KRAMER Behold! The Games of the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance!
JERRY Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what they do. It's not going to make any difference.
KRAMER Jerry, what is your problem?
JERRY Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider people's feelings.
KRAMER All right, Jerry--are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?
JERRY No.
KRAMER Tantric yoga?
JERRY No.
KRAMER Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual delights that most men dare not dream of!
JERRY Boy, you can really talk some trash. I guess that's better than eating it.
KRAMER All right, all right, why don't we just watch the tape?
JERRY All right.
GEORGE Did you pass your stone yet?
KRAMER Not yet. But the suspense is killing me.
JERRY Hey, that's her!
KRAMER Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her. Look at the height, Jerry, the extension! Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half-turn, giant into a straddle, back into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh, nice leg extension, good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full in, double back, and she sticks the landing! Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape? Well, I'll take that as a yes.
JERRY Well, here we are.
KATYA Yes. We are here.
JERRY How did you stay on that beam like that? I mean, it's only this wide!
KATYA I can balance myself in any position.
KATYA It is amazing after years of training how one can contort one's body. Of course, it is only useful in gymnastics.
JERRY Oh boy...
JERRY I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a "magical world" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, there was nothing gymnastic about it.
ELAINE Well, what did you think she was gonna do?
JERRY Well, you know. I mean... I dunno.
ELAINE No, what?
JERRY Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know...
ELAINE What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk and...
JERRY You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of specifics...
ELAINE Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What?
JERRY Well... Frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kinda' be like the apparatus.
KRAMER You mean like the uneven parallel bars?
JERRY See, again, I really don't feel that...
ELAINE The balance beam?
JERRY Could we stop?
ELAINE Not the pommel horse?
JERRY All right. Let's just drop it.
JERRY So lemme ask you this: how long would you say I have to put in now because of, you know, last night.
ELAINE I dunno, at least three weeks.
JERRY Oh, great.
ELAINE Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly put the kibosh on the big water merger.
JERRY Between Poland and Morgan?
ELAINE Yeah. Started a big name controversy.
JERRY Kramer! The stone!
JERRY What happened, did you pass the stone?
KRAMER No, I tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch and I didn't make it.
GEORGE "...tootsie, good-bye. Too-too, tootsie..." You call this coffee?
MAN_IN_CAR Hey! What the hell was that?!
GEORGE I'm sorry! I'm terribly sorry! I- I-
MAN_IN_CAR Clean that up!
GEORGE Oh, sure. Of course. Um, uh, could you hold these? For just a second, just a second. Here you go, now don't worry about a thing. It's gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine.
MRS._ENRIGHT 
GEORGE Look at this sparkle. Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
GEORGE No, Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have a job! Well, did she see a squeegee? Well, you're not going to make a dime without a squeegee. That's right, that's right, just tell your mother it was all a big misunderstanding. You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see you later. Buh-bye.
JERRY Strike two!
GEORGE You think I'm going down?
JERRY You're behind in the count.
GEORGE I know.
KRAMER Hey, what are you doing later?
JERRY I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you.
KRAMER Well, maybe you should try again. You know what happens the first time: people are a little shy, a little reticent.
JERRY If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks.
KRAMER All right, where you going?
JERRY We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out.
KRAMER Well, Jerry, it's your obligation. C'mon.
JERRY Yeah, well, y'know what? If I gotta go, and spend time with this girl, then you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops!
KRAMER No, no, no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry.
JERRY Yeah, well you're going.
KRAMER Yeah, but I'm afraid of clowns!
MR._PITT I didn't send you over there to complain about the name.
ELAINE Well, I couldn't help it. "Moland Spring"?
MR._PITT I like the name "Moland". I picked it out. After all those months of negotiating!
ELAINE Well, I'm so sorry! I-
MR._PITT Well, I'm going riding. I haven't been on Jenny for three days, all because of this blasted painting. Elaine?
ELAINE Oh, sorry. Hello?
MR._PITT Wait a minute! Wait a minute. Ah!
KATYA So, Jerry, you're enjoying the circus?
JERRY "Greatest Show on Earth"!
KATYA My father used to take me to the circus. When the elephants came by, he would scream curses at them, blaming them for all the ills of society.
JERRY Well, they certainly take up a lot of space.
KATYA Ah, Misha!
MISHA Katya!
KATYA Misha, this is Jerry.
MISHA Ah, yes. The "co-me-dian", eh?
KATYA 
ELAINE Oh, yes, yes I'll tell him. Yes, thank you. Um, um hold on. Mr. Pitt!
MR._PITT I think I'm on to something!
ELAINE Mr. Pitt! The board of directors is on the phone. They've called an emergency meeting. They want you to be there to discuss the merger!
MR._PITT You said keep your eyes out of focus, which is misleading. You want deep focus!
ELAINE Yes, hi. Okay, fine, yeah, hold on just a second. Lemme just... Yeah, I've got it... Oh! Oh! Yeah, yeah, he'll be there. Mr. Pitt, you have got to stop staring at that poster!
MR._PITT I see something that could be a spaceship. Is it round? Is it pointy?
ELAINE No, you don't see it, and you're never going to see it! Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders, you have to leave now. Do you hear me? Do you hear me?!
MR._PITT Hmm, what's happened to me? When's the meeting?
ELAINE In about twenty minutes.
MR._PITT Oh! Do I have time to change?
ELAINE Um, no.
MR._PITT Well, excuse me, I'd better get straight over there.
ELAINE Uh, Mr. Pitt...
MR._PITT Yes?
ELAINE Um, there's a just...
MR._PITT Is that ink?
ELAINE No?
GEORGE Well, here we are.
LINDSAY Do you want to come in? My mother's having a little party.
GEORGE Maybe I could just use the bathroom.
LINDSAY Sure.
ANNOUNCER Ladies and gentlemen, could I direct your attention to the center ring, where the incomparable Misha will balance ten stories above the circus floor on a wire no wider than a human thumb.
MISHA It is time.
JERRY Well, break a leg.
JERRY Eh, show biz...
ANNOUNCER Ladies and gentlemen, the incomparable Misha!
JERRY Boy, those capes are really coming back.
PARTY_GUEST Oh, sorry I took so long. They've got one of those 3-D art posters in there. It's mesmerizing.
JERRY What is that sound?
KATYA It is horrible!
GEORGE Whew! Anybody see that poster in there? That is weird, wild stuff, huh? Whew!
MR._PITT I have been accused of wrong-doing. But these false accusations will not deter us. We WILL annex Poland by the Spring, at any cost! AND... our stock will rise HIGH!
KATYA He'll be all right. I must go and be with Misha now. I don't want you to come with me.
JERRY Oh, why not?
KATYA It has been three days since our night together. Misha said that was all the time I needed to put in.
JERRY Really?
KATYA In my country, they speak of a man so virile, so potent, that to spend a night with such a man is to enter a world of such sensual delights most women dare not dream of. This man is known as the "Comedian". You may tell jokes, Mr. Jerry Seinfeld, but you are no Comedian.
JERRY Loyalty to any one sports team is pretty hard to justify. Because the players are always changing, the team can move to another city, you're actually rooting for the clothes when you get right down to it. You know what I mean, you are standing and cheering and yelling for your clothes to beat the clothes from another city. Fans will be so in love with a player but if he goes to another team, they boo him. This is the same human being in a different shirt, they hate him now. Boo! different shirt!! Boo.
JERRY You sure you don't want the tickets?
GEORGE No thanks.
JERRY I can't believe I'm having trouble getting rid of Super Bowl tickets.
GEORGE I'm telling you, skip the Drake's wedding, go to the game.
JERRY I can't, the Drake put me in the wedding party.
GEORGE Well who schedules his wedding on Super Bowl Sunday?
JERRY Maybe he didn't know?
GEORGE Lemme see. I can't believe you got these for free. Row F?!
JERRY Row F, in front of the Gs, hobnobbing with the Ds and Es.
GEORGE Howbout Kramer or Elaine, they don't want them?
JERRY I asked. Elaine laughed at me, Kramer's only interested in Canadian football.
GEORGE Wish I could help you.
JERRY Come on, take them. You could take Bonnie.
GEORGE You paying my hotel and airfare to Miami?
JERRY What do you think?
GEORGE So in order to use these, I gotta spend like fifteen-hundred bucks. This is a bill for fifteen-hundred dollars. Plus, she'd ask about the sleeping arrangements, that whole sleeping arrangement conversation is depressing.
JERRY Yeah, sleeping arrangements. So, you haven't, uh...
GEORGE Oh, no no no, I haven't even seen her apartment yet. Tomorrow night's the first night.
JERRY Aah.
GEORGE Hey, is that Tim Whatley?
JERRY The Dentist?
GEORGE Yeah, is he still mad at you for crashing his Thanksgiving party?
JERRY Oh, no. I explained the whole thing to him, he was fine with it.
GEORGE Oh good.
JERRY Yeah, I blamed it on you. Hi Tim.
TIM Hey Jerry! George. What are you up to?
JERRY Ah, just a couple of gals out on the town, shopping and gabbing.
GEORGE I'm getting a makeover.
JERRY Hey. How would you like to go to the Super Bowl?
TIM What, are you kidding?
JERRY Here. Two tickets. Have a good time.
TIM How can I think you? I'll tell you what, I'll take you to dinner sometime. You ever been to Mendys?
JERRY No no no. No dinner.
JERRY Tim, you didn't have to get me a thank you gift. I know, it's a label maker. The Label Baby Junior. Yeah, I hear they're good. Well, label me thankful. Okay, well you enjoy those tickets. Buh-bye.
JERRY Come in.
KRAMER Where can I put this?
JERRY What is it?
KRAMER It's Risk, Jerry. The game of world conquest. Alright, that's perfect.
JERRY Kramer, why do you have to Hello, Newman.
NEWMAN Hello, Jerry. Will he take it? I gotta go to work.
JERRY Take what?
KRAMER The board, Jerry. We've been playing at Newman's for six hours but he's gotta go.
JERRY So why don't you leave it at Newman's?
NEWMAN I wanted to, he won't let me.
KRAMER We have to put the board in a neutral place where no one will tamper with it.
JERRY So that's here?
KRAMER Yes, yes. You're like Switzerland.
JERRY I don't wanna be Switzerland.
KRAMER Jerry, Newman and I are engaged in a epic struggle for world domination. It's winner take all. People cannot be trusted.
NEWMAN Don't look at me.
KRAMER Oh, I'm looking right at you, big daddy.
JERRY Alright, soldier boys, let's fall out.
KRAMER Alright, so you're gonna look after it?
JERRY Yeah, yeah.
KRAMER Stay strong buddy.
JERRY Yeah.
KRAMER Watch it good.
JERRY Ok.
ELAINE Hey.
JERRY Hey.
ELAINE Hey. Oh, is that a label maker?
JERRY Yes it is. I got it as a gift, it's a Label Baby Junior.
ELAINE Love the Label Baby, baby. You know those things make great gifts, I just got one of those for Tim Whatley for Christmas.
JERRY Tim Whatley?
ELAINE Yeah. Who sent you that one?
JERRY One Tim Whatley! Elaine. No, my Tim Whatley?
JERRY The same, he sent it as a thank you for my Super Bowl tickets.
ELAINE I think this is the same one I gave him. He recycled this gift. He's a regifter!
JERRY Or maybe he liked your gift so much, he decided to get me the same thing. Perhaps it's an homage.
ELAINE Yeah, perhaps.
JERRY Well how did he react when you gave it to him?
ELAINE Um, he said, "Oh. A label maker. Howbout that?"
JERRY He repeated the name of the gift?
ELAINE Yeah, so?
JERRY Oh, well, if you repeat the name of the gift, you can't possibly like it.
ELAINE What do you mean?
JERRY Oh, you know, like when someone opens something up and they go, "Oh. Tube socks." What are you gonna do about it?
ELAINE I don't know, I guess I'll just get invited up to his apartment and see if he's got a label maker.
JERRY Why'd you get him a gift anyway?
ELAINE Oh, he did some dental work for me and he didn't charge me so I thought I'd get him a Christmas present.
JERRY Yeah, well, if you're getting him anything for his birthday, I'm a large.
BONNIE Well, here we are. This is the place.
GEORGE Wow.
BONNIE Do you like it?
GEORGE I love it! This is fantastic! Look at this couch, is this velvet?!
BONNIE Are you a velvet fan?
GEORGE A fan? I would drape myself in velvet if it were socially acceptable. And look at this, hardwood floors!
BONNIE Aren't they great? Oh, Scott, hi. This is George. George, this is Scott, my roommate.
GEORGE Heh heh.
BONNIE Here, check out this view. If you lean out this window, you can see the river.
GEORGE So Scott's your roommate, huh?
BONNIE Yes. Oh, I'm sure I've mentioned him.
GEORGE No, you didn't mention it.
BONNIE He's a great guy, you'll really like him.
GEORGE I'm sure I will.
JERRY Male roommate, huh?
GEORGE Yes. A male roommate.
JERRY Is this a problem?
GEORGE It's a huge problem, Jerry. The hardest part about having sex with a woman is getting her to come back to your place! He's already got that.
JERRY Well, maybe he's...
GEORGE No. Believe me, he's not.
JERRY So he's an eligible receiver.
GEORGE She's confiding in him about our dates. You always like the person you talk to about the date more than the date! It's just a matter of time till they realize, 'Hey, we could have sex.'
JERRY What's stopping them?
GEORGE Exactly! You know how they get animals to reproduce in captivity? They just put them in the same cage.
JERRY What does he look like?
GEORGE Oh, that's the worst part of it. He looks just like me.
JERRY He looks like you and he's working from the inside?
GEORGE I look like me and I'm working from the outside. Who do you think is in the better position?
JERRY Not you.
GEORGE Ho ho. This bizarre ?harrod? experiment must end!
JERRY We'll take a check please.
GEORGE I gotta find a way to work this out, I love that apartment. It's so cozy, I'm ensconced in velvet. You know, if it were socially acceptable--
JERRY I know, you would drape yourself in velvet.
GEORGE I've said that before?
JERRY Many times. You love velvet, you want to live in velvet, everything with the velvet.
KRAMER Hey.
GEORGE Hey.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER Guess what? I saw Newman talking to the super.
JERRY So what?
KRAMER The super has keys to your apartment. Don't you see what's going on? Newman is planning a sneak attack.
JERRY Oh, maybe he's got no hot water.
KRAMER Yeah, alright, fine. You sit there and you watch while Newman takes over the world. But he'd be a horrible leader. And you know who's gonna suffer? The little people; you and George.
JERRY Are you through?
KRAMER Oh. I talked to Arthur Jobanian. Yeah, the Drake's wedding? That's off.
JERRY The wedding is off? What happened?
KRAMER The Drake, he found out that the wedding is on the same day as the Super Bowl. So he wanted to postpone it, they got in a big argument and phlf it's over.
GEORGE The wedding is off. Now you can go to the Super Bowl.
JERRY I can't call Tim Whatley and ask for the tickets back.
GEORGE You just gave them to him two days ago, he's gotta give you a grace period.
JERRY Are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving? There's no grace period.
GEORGE Well, didn't he regift the label maker?
JERRY Possibly.
GEORGE Well, if he can regift, why can't you degift?
JERRY You may have a point.
GEORGE I have a point, I have a point.
JERRY Alright, I'll call him.
GEORGE Yeah. What's that?
JERRY Oh, it's Risk, it's a game of world domination being played by two guys who can barely run their own lives. Hello Tim? Yeah, hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld, remember those tickets I gave you? Well it turns out I can use them. Oh, you do? I understand. Okay. Bye. He already made plans, he can't change them.
GEORGE Well they're his tickets, he can do what he wants with them.
JERRY Thanks.
GEORGE Alright, I gotta go. I'm heading over to Bonnie's.
JERRY What are you gonna do about the roommate?
GEORGE I gotta try and find a way to switch places with him. It's like a Sigfried and Roy trick.
JERRY Well, the pickle breath is a good start.
NEWMAN Hello Jerry, may I come in?
JERRY What do you want?
NEWMAN Nothing, just being neighborly. Do you wanna hang out? Shoot the breeze?
JERRY I'm not letting you cheat, Newman. You're not getting anywhere near that board.
NEWMAN Jerry? I'm a little insulted.
JERRY You're not a little anything, Newman. So just pack it up and move it out of here.
NEWMAN Oh, by the way, what are you doing for the Super Bowl?
JERRY I dunno, watch it on TV I guess. Why?
NEWMAN Well if you watch closely enough, you just might see me. I'll be the one waving to the camera from my seat on the forty yard line.
JERRY You're going to the Super Bowl?
NEWMAN Yes I am, a guy on my mail route just got a couple of tickets and he offered one to me.
JERRY What's his name?
NEWMAN Tim Whatley.
JERRY That's my ticket!
NEWMAN Is it?! Ohhh, well if only you'd known, you could have saved some time and given it directly to me! Ha ha ha.
JERRY Newman!
GEORGE What a movie. Good choice.
BONNIE Thank Scott. He recommended it.
GEORGE Oh, Scott, Scott. He's really great, isn't he?
BONNIE Yes he is.
GEORGE Yes he is. Let me ask you something. When you come out of the shower and you put your robe on, do you cinch it real tight, are you concerned about that?
BONNIE George?
GEORGE Do you hold the neck together with one hand, or are you just letting it flap in the breeze?
BONNIE George, you're being ridiculous.
GEORGE What's the massage situation?
BONNIE What do you mean?
GEORGE Is there any work being done? Is there any rubbing, touching, finger manipulation on the other person, and if so, who's making the request?
BONNIE George, would you just stop?
GEORGE Say you go to the bathroom at two o'clock in the morning, what's the outfit? I mean, you dressing up or is it come as you are?
BONNIE George, what is wrong with you?
GEORGE I'll tell you what's wrong, a grown woman with a male roommate! It's unnatural, it's an abomination!
SCOTT Hey!
GEORGE Hey!
SCOTT How ya going?
GEORGE I'm good.
SCOTT Are you gonna need the bathroom? 'Cause I'm gonna jump in the shower.
BONNIE No, just throw my bras out of the way.
TIM Well, this is my building.
ELAINE Yes it is.
TIM This was fun, you know?
ELAINE Yeah.
TIM So, I'll call.
ELAINE Aren't you gonna invite me upstairs?
TIM Upstairs? You wanna go upstairs?
ELAINE I would love to go upstairs.
TIM Elaine, you are something else. No one can ever put a label on you, huh?
ELAINE We'll see.
JERRY Newman. He's going with Newman.
GEORGE How does Tim Whatley even know Newman?
JERRY Newman's his mailman.
GEORGE Who goes to the Super Bowl with their mailman?!
JERRY Who goes anywhere with Newman?!
GEORGE Well, he's merry.
JERRY He is merry, I'll give him that. What's this plant for?
GEORGE I had a little tiff with Bonnie about the roommate.
JERRY Oh, well the cactus will smooth things over.
ELAINE Hey, guess what? I'm going to the Super Bowl with Tim Whatley.
JERRY What?
ELAINE We went out for coffee last night and he offered me a ticket.
JERRY What about the label maker?
ELAINE Ah, well.
JERRY Wait a minute, that's my ticket! You didn't even want to go.
ELAINE It was totally out of the blue. We went upstairs to his apartment, you know, to look for the label maker.
JERRY So, how did you get up there? Did you say you had to use the bathroom?
ELAINE No.
JERRY Then how'd you get up there?
ELAINE I said, "Do you wanna go upstairs?"
GEORGE And there's you ticket.
ELAINE What?
JERRY That's why you're going to the Super Bowl.
ELAINE Why?
JERRY You go out with a guy one time, you ask him to go upstairs like you're Mae West? Of course he's gonna try and get you alone for the weekend.
ELAINE You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs, he thinks he's going downtown?
JERRY Obviously.
ELAINE You're crazy.
GEORGE Well, what happened when you got upstairs?
ELAINE As soon as we walked in, he got a call from one of his patients with an impacted molar or something so he had to leave. I didn't even get a chance to look for the label maker.
JERRY Yeah, well I don't trust this guy. I think he regifted, he degifted, and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Super Bowl sex romp.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey. What are you doing?
KRAMER I'm watching your door.
JERRY My door?
KRAMER Yeah, from my peephole. Fisheye, sees all.
JERRY What was that?
KRAMER Newman!
NEWMAN Damn!
JERRY The bedroom!
JERRY I see you, Newman! I see you!
KRAMER I'm taking the Congo as a penalty!
ELAINE I've got a confession to make.
TIM Oh? What's that?
ELAINE I've got Super Bowl fever.
TIM Oh yeah, me too.
ELAINE So where are we staying?
TIM Oh, the Ambassador.
ELAINE Oh. Big room?
TIM It's a regular room, but it's right downtown.
ELAINE Downtown?
TIM Right downtown.
ELAINE What do they have there, a couple of beds?
TIM Why? You bringing someone else?
ELAINE No, but don't you think there should be two beds? There's two of us.
BONNIE Oh, a cactus.
GEORGE They don't need any water, so you don't have to keep taking them to the bathroom.
SCOTT Well, look who's here.
BONNIE I asked Scott to move out.
GEORGE Oh. Oh!
JERRY So she kicked him out of the apartment.
GEORGE That's right. It's just me and her.
JERRY Wow, she rearranged her whole life for you.
GEORGE I guess she did. He's gone, now I'm the man.
JERRY That's not a good role for you.
GEORGE No, it's not.
JERRY You unwittingly made a major commitment. That's a lot of pressure.
GEORGE Oh my god.
JERRY You wanted to be ensconced in velvet, you're buried.
GEORGE I had the perfect situation here, he was shouldering half the load.
JERRY He was shouldering.
GEORGE I couldn't leave well enough alone?!
JERRY Where are you going?
GEORGE I gotta go help her tape up all his boxes and get them ready for shipping.
JERRY Oh, well here. Take Whatley's label maker, I don't want to see it again.
GEORGE Thanks.
KRAMER Yeah. I am taking over South America and there ain't nothing you can do about it.
JERRY So, too bad about that Super Bowl ticket, eh Newman?
NEWMAN Yeah. I just hope Tim Whatley's electric bills don't suddenly get lost in the mail, or it could be lights out for him.
JERRY Thanks for having me over, guys.
JERRY Alright, I'll see you later.
TIM Hey Jerry?
JERRY Ah, Tim Whatley. Out scalping?
TIM Ah, see, now I've been thinking a lot about what happened and I feel horrible. Listen, I want to give you a ticket back.
JERRY Are you serious, what about Elaine?
TIM Oh, Elaine. Yeah, well, things just didn't work out like I thought they would.
JERRY Oh. Hey, isn't this Kramer's car? Hey, Cosmo!! They're towing your car!!
KRAMER What?! Not my car!! Hey!! They're towing my car!!
NEWMAN What are you doing?
KRAMER I'm taking the board with me.
TIM So, I guess I'll see you at the game.
JERRY Yeah, see you there.
BONNIE Hi, George.
GEORGE What, what happened? Where's, where's all the stuff?
BONNIE It's gone. It was all his. Is this a label maker?
GEORGE The table, the stereo, the VCR, the velvet couch, where's the velvet?
BONNIE They were his. Besides, we don't need any of those things. We have each other.
NEWMAN Are you sure you know where the impound yard is?
KRAMER Oh, stop stalling. Come on.
NEWMAN I can't think, there's all this noise.
KRAMER Or is it because I've built a stronghold around Greenland? I've driven you out of Western Europe and I've left you teetering on the brink of complete annihilation.
NEWMAN I'm not beaten yet. I still have armies in the Ukraine.
KRAMER Ha ha, the Ukraine. Do you know what the Ukraine is? It's a sitting duck. A road apple, Newman. The Ukraine is weak. It's feeble. I think it's time to put the hurt on the Ukraine.
UKRAINIAN I come from Ukraine. You not say Ukraine weak.
KRAMER Yeah, well we're playing a game here, pal.
UKRAINIAN Ukraine is game to you?! Howbout I take your little board and smash it!!
ELAINE Hello, Tim.
TIM Elaine, hi.
ELAINE Don't worry, Tim. I didn't come by to yell at you, I didn't come by for that at all. I just came by to pick up my label maker. I gave you a label maker and now I would like to have it back.
TIM But you gave it to me.
ELAINE But you gave me a ticket to the Super Bowl. Hand it over, Whatley.
TIM Uh, ok.
ELAINE You don't have the label maker, do you?
TIM Uh, no.
ELAINE I knew it! You're a regifter!
TIM Oh, yeah, some gift. That thing didn't work at all.
ELAINE What?
TIM You put a label on something, then ten minutes later it would peel right off. It was the worst gift I ever got.
ELAINE Well, I bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work. The way you worked on my filling, you were so, so gentle and so caring and so sensitive.
TIM Oh, Elaine!
JERRY H... G... F. Seat four. One, two, three... f-- Hello Newman.
NEWMAN Hello, Jerry. Tim couldn't make it, he's in love. Isn't that wonderful?
JERRY Oh, it's enchanting.
BONNIE Hi.
GEORGE Here's the TV. I know you wanted to watch the Super Bowl. Do you at least have some towels we could sit on? It's, like, a four hour game.
BONNIE George, Scott's gonna drop by. He said he never got his boxes. I'll get the towels.
GEORGE How am I gonna get out of this? Think Costanza, think!
BONNIE Here we are.
GEORGE Hey, do you know, Bonnie, I just had a pretty wild idea.
BONNIE What is it?
GEORGE Well I, uh, I'm not sure how you pronounce it or anything, but I, uh, I believe it's Menage a Trois?
BONNIE What?
SCOTT Hi.
BONNIE Scott! Remember what we talked about the other day? George is into it.
SCOTT Oh really?!
NEWMAN Great streak of luck I'm having. First, Kramer almost beat me at Risk but I narrowly escaped, and then Tim Whatley gives me his Super Bowl ticket.
JERRY Can you move over at all?!
NEWMAN And then, just as I'm about to go, these boxes show up at the post office with no labels. No labels, Jerry. You know what that means? Freebies!! I got this great mini-TV and a VCR, oh it's unbelievable.
JERRY An inch! Can you move over an inch?!?
ELAINE Mr. Peterman sent me over here for a physical because as you may or may not know, he and I are going on a trip to Kenya. Africa. My first such mission for the company. The Massai bushmen wear these great sandals and we're gonna knock them off. Not the Massai, the sandals.
DOCTOR I'll need a urine sample.
ELAINE Right.
GEORGE You know how hot it gets there? Like 150 degrees. Your skin is gonna be simmering with boils.
ELAINE Oh, Come on.
JERRY Hey George, you coming to the Tonight Show on Thursday?
GEORGE Hey, yeah. My parents want to come too, is that ok?
JERRY Yeah, sure. My parents will be there.
ELAINE The Tonight Show?
JERRY Yeah, they're in town this week, you wanna go?
ELAINE Are you doing new material?
JERRY No.
ELAINE I don't think so.
KRAMER Hey. Super's in my bathroom changing my shower head. Have they changed your shower head?
JERRY No, he's doing mine next. They're low flow you know.
KRAMER Low flow? Well I don't like the sound of that.
ELAINE So what are your parents doing here in new York?
JERRY Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, my father left office in disgrace.
ELAINE So what are their plans?
JERRY Well, this is the problem. They're moving into this new development. Here's the pamphlet. Del Boca Vista. But they're not quite ready to go back so they're in seclusion here for a while at Uncle Leo's.
ELAINE You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment?
JERRY No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact, he moved in with her.
GEORGE Uncle Leo's having regular sex?
JERRY Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing.
JERRY Hello?
MORTY Jerry, what time do we have to be at the the Tonight Show on Thursday.
JERRY You gotta be there at 4:30.
MORTY But it comes on 11:30.
JERRY Yeah, well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at 11:30.
MORTY How long they been doing this?
JERRY 30 years.
MORTY Helen, did you know that they tape this thing in the afternoon?
JERRY All right, I'll see you later.
ELAINE Georgie, how come your parents never moved to Florida?
GEORGE Yeah, that is odd, isn't it?
JERRY Yeah, it is.
GEORGE I mean, they're retired.
JERRY No economic reason for them to be here.
GEORGE They have no friends.
JERRY No social reason for them to be here.
ELAINE You're all grown up.
GEORGE Yeah, they're all through ruining my life. What the hell are they still doing here? Lemme see this pamphlet. Hm. All right, so I'll, uh, get back to you.
JERRY Hello?
HELEN Where can I buy some ice? Your father likes a lot of ice.
JERRY I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?
HELEN I can do that.
JERRY You know Dad just called me.
HELEN Yeah, I know. His phlebitis is acting up.
JERRY Yeah, all right, well I got some people here.
HELEN Ok.
JERRY All right, bye. : You see this? Any thought pops into their head they're calling me because it's a local call now.
ELAINE Ahh.
JERRY I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. Plus I got the dinners, I got the pop ins. They pop in! It's brutal!
ELAINE They have no idea when they're going back to Florida?
JERRY The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has to move back into the apartment and then they would have to go back to Florida.
ELAINE How's that gonna happen?
UNCLE_LEO It's about time you called your uncle. We've got to do this once a week.
JERRY Once a week? So how's Lydia?
UNCLE_LEO Ah, she's a real tiger.
JERRY I don't know how you do it.
UNCLE_LEO What?
JERRY A man like you, limiting yourself to one woman, I don't know. But it's none of my business.
UNCLE_LEO What are you talking about?
JERRY Well...
UNCLE_LEO Look at this, I told them medium rare, it's medium.
JERRY Hey, it happens.
UNCLE_LEO I bet that cook is an anti-Semite.
JERRY He has no idea who you are.
UNCLE_LEO They don't just overcook a hamburger, Jerry.
JERRY All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles made your hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger. C'mon Uncle Leo, I've seen the way women look at you. When's the last time you looked in a mirror? You're an Adonis! You've got beautiful features, lovely skin, you're in the prime of your life here, you should be swinging. If I were you I'd tell this Lydia character, "It's been real," move back into that bachelor pad and put out a sign; Open for business.
UNCLE_LEO Believe me, I thought about it. But she is so perfect in every way, I can't see a flaw.
JERRY Well, keep looking.
PETERMAN I'm afraid I have some bad news, Elaine. It appears you will not be accompanying me to Africa.
ELAINE What? Why not?
PETERMAN I'm afraid it's your urine, Elaine. You tested positive for opium.
ELAINE Opium?
PETERMAN That's right, Elaine. White lotus. Yam-yam. Shanghai Sally.
ELAINE Ihat's impossible, I've never done a drug in my life. Dr. Strugatz must have made a mistake.
PETERMAN Not a chance. I'm afraid I'll just have to find someone else to accompany me on my journey. The dark continent is no place for an addict, Elaine.
ELAINE Obviously, Mr. Peterman, there's something wrong with this test. I don't take opium. Let me take another one, please? I'll call the doctor right now, I'll take a pop urine test.
PETERMAN All right, Elaine.
ELAINE Oh, thank you Mr. Peterman. I'll be ready in three minutes.
GEORGE Whew! Boy, it's cold outside, huh? Oh, these New York winters, huh. Bitter cold, bitter.
FRANK I was out for five minutes before, I couldn't feel my extremities.
ESTELLE What extremities?
GEORGE You know what the temperature in Florida is today? Eh? Seventy-nine. That's almost eighty. Yeah, I read someplace the life expectancy in Florida is eighty-one and in Queens, seventy-three.
ESTELLE So George, why are you here?
GEORGE What, I can't stop by and visit my parents?
ESTELLE What's this.
GEORGE That's where the Seinfeld's are moving. They got a great deal. Yep. You know what they got in Florida? Jai-Alai! You bet on the games, you clean up.
ESTELLE I don't bet.
GEORGE What about the dolphins? You could swim with the dolphins down there.
ESTELLE I don't swim.
GEORGE You could pet them. They come right out of the water onto the sidewalks.
ESTELLE Are you trying to get rid of us?
GEORGE Rid? Nah, c'mon, the word is 'care'. Care. I care about your comfort, be it here in Queens or twelve-hundred miles away.
ELAINE No?
KRAMER Jerry? Jerry!
KRAMER Wha, you too?
JERRY Yeah!
KRAMER These showers are horrible. There's no pressure, I can't get the shampoo out of my hair.
JERRY Me either.
KRAMER If I don't have a good shower I am not myself. I feel weak and ineffectual. I'm not Kramer.
JERRY You? What about me? I got the Tonight Show tonight. I'm gonna have to shower in the dressing room.
KRAMER Aw.
JERRY Where are you going?
KRAMER I gotta find another shower.
KRAMER They got you too?
NEWMAN This stuff is awful! I'm not Newman!
KRAMER Oh, Elaine. Yeah.
ELAINE Kramer, you look terrible.
KRAMER Look, I need the keys to your apartment, I gotta take a shower.
ELAINE What's wrong with your shower?
KRAMER There's no water pressure.
ELAINE Why don't you just go see Jerry?
KRAMER Jerry's got nothing. Newman's got nothing. You're the only one I know who's got the good stuff, and I need it bad, baby, cause I feel like I got bugs crawling up my skin. Now you gotta help me out.
PETERMAN Not on my watch! I won't have you turning my office into a den of iniquity! Get your fix somewhere else!
ELAINE Mr Peterman! What are you doing?
PETERMAN Elaine, you're out of control. You need help.
ELAINE Huh?
PETERMAN I know what you're going through. I too once fell under the spell of opium. It was 1979. I was travelling the Yangtzee in search of a Mongolian horsehair vest. I had got to the market after sundown, all of the clothing traders had gone, but a different sort of trader still lurked about. "Just a taste," he said. That was all it took.
ELAINE Mr. Peterman, I don't know what's going on here. I am not addicted to anything.
PETERMAN Oh, Elaine. The toll road of denial is a long and dangerous one. desk. You're fired.
HELEN All they serve is chicken?
JERRY There's more food down the hall.
MORTY Wrap it up, we'll take it home.
JERRY Oh, hi.
ESTELLE Hello Seinfelds.
MORTY Hello.
HELEN Hi.
FRANK This is your dressing room? They treat you like Toscanini.
ESTELLE Oh, Jerry. I don't know how you could do this. I'm so nervous for you.
JERRY Actually, I'm drunk.
GEORGE Hey, hey, how was Florida?
MORTY Well, we just bought a new place down there.
ESTELLE I know, we were looking at the brochure.
MORTY What?
HELEN Why, you thinking of moving?
FRANK Not really.
MORTY Because if you are, you shouldn't. There's nothing available in that development.
FRANK Are you telling me there's not one condo available in all of Del Boca Vista?
MORTY That's right. They went like hotcakes.
FRANK How'd you get yours?
MORTY Got lucky.
FRANK Are you trying to keep us out of Del Boca Vista?!
JERRY I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you could perhaps conduct your psychopath convention down the hall, I could just get a little personal space.
ELAINE How could I have tested positive twice? Once I could understand, that's a mistake. But twice?
WAITRESS Yeah, it's hard to figure.
ELAINE I mean I lost my job, I can't go to Africa. I was gonna meet the bushmen of the Kalahari.
WAITRESS Ah, the bushmen?
ELAINE And the bushwomen.
MAN Excuse me. I couldn't help overhearing. I notice you're eating a poppy seed muffin.
ELAINE Yeah, I eat these muffins all the time.
MAN Well, you know what opium is made from...
ELAINE Poppies!
JAY Welcome back. Talking with Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry, lemme ask you, I saw some people back there, they look like.. family? Is that family?
JERRY Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family's nuts; they're crazy. Yep. My uncle Leo, I had lunch with him the other day, he's one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life, he blames it on anti-Semitism. You know what I mean, the spaghetti's not al dente? Cook's an anti-Semite. Loses a bet on a horse. Secretariat? Anti-Semitic. Doesn't get a good seat at the temple. Rabbi? Anti-Semite.
JERRY Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of the bit I did. She thought it was funny, so he accused her of being an anti-Semite. They had a huge fight and now he's moving back into his apartment. You know what this means, my parents are gonna go back to Florida... What? What number is this? Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
JERRY Hey Kramer, my parents are gonna have to move back to Florida, isn't that great?
KRAMER Yeah, well I'm really happy for ya.
JERRY Hey, you're not giving it to me, man. What's wrong?
KRAMER I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath?
JERRY No good?
KRAMER It's disgusting. I'm sitting there in a tepid pool of my own filth. All kinds of microscopic parasites and organisms having sex all around me.
JERRY Well, you used to sit in that hot tub?
KRAMER Jerry, that was superheated water, nothing could live in that.
JERRY Chicken?
KRAMER Oh, yeah.
ELAINE Well, this you're not gonna believe. I found out why I was testing positive for opium. Poppy seeds!
JERRY Poppy seeds!
KRAMER Well, that makes sense. Want some chicken?
ELAINE Yeah. Thanks. So, I'm gonna get tested again later, hopefully I'll get my job back and I will be on my way to Africa.
JERRY Hello Newman.
NEWMAN Hello Jerry. Well, I may have a solution to our little problem. Elaine, would you excuse us?
ELAINE Oh c'mon, Newman.
NEWMAN I have a private matter to discuss with my fellow tenants. If you don't mind?
ELAINE Jerry?
NEWMAN Look, sister, go get yourself a cup of coffee, all right? Beat it! All right, now here's the lowdown. From a certain connection, I've been able to locate some black market shower heads. They're all made in the former Yugoslavia, and from what I hear the Serbs are fanatic about their showers.
JERRY Not from the footage I've seen.
NEWMAN Nevertheless, sometime this afternoon, behind the Market Diner, an unmarked van will be waiting. I'm expecting the call at any time. Are you in?
KRAMER I'm down.
NEWMAN Jerry?
ESTELLE So, Georgie, we have some big news for you.
GEORGE Big news?
ESTELLE We're moving to Florida.
GEORGE What? You're moving to Florida!?! That's wonderful! I'm so happy! For you! I'm so happy for you! Oh, what do you need this cold weather for?
FRANK Has nothing to do with the weather, it's because of the Seinfelds.
GEORGE What do you mean?
FRANK They don't want us there, so we're going. We're moving right into Del Boca Vista!
GEORGE So you're moving there for spite!
FRANK Absolutely. No one tells Frank Costanza what to do!
GEORGE That's right, who the hell are they? How dare they?!
ESTELLE So, Georgie, are you gonna come to visit us?
GEORGE Oh, every chance I get.
ESTELLE Ohhh.
GEORGE Jerry? Jerry! I'm busting! I'm busting!
JERRY What's going on?
GEORGE My parents are moving to Florida!
JERRY Are you kidding?
GEORGE Can you believe it? It's happening! It's finally happening! I'm free!!
JERRY Where are they moving to?
GEORGE Del Boca Vista!
JERRY Del Boca Vista, that's where my parents are gonna live!
GEORGE I know!
JERRY We could visit together!
GEORGE Every five years!
JERRY That's incredible!
GEORGE I know, I know and you know why they're moving there?
JERRY Why?
GEORGE To spite your parents!
JERRY To spite my parents?
GEORGE Yeah!
JERRY Your parents are crazy!
GEORGE I know, they're out of their minds! It's fantastic!
JERRY My parents are moving back too!
GEORGE Beautiful!
MORTY I'm sorry Leo's moving back here. I'm not ready to go back to Florida.
HELEN He was getting along so well with that woman, what happened?
MORTY Hello?
VOICE This is Frank Costanza.
MORTY What do you want?
FRANK You think you could keep us out of Florida? We're moving in lock, stock and barrel. We're gonna be in the pool. We're gonna be in the clubhouse. We're gonna be all over that shuffleboard court! And I dare you to keep me out!
MORTY I'm sorry, we can't go back to Florida.
GEORGE I can't believe I didn't push for this sooner.
JERRY You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result of this. Food tastes better. The air seems fresher. You'll have more energy and self confidence than you ever dreamed of.
JERRY Hello.
MORTY Hello, Jerry? It's your father.
JERRY Oh, hi dad.
MORTY Listen, is it all right if we move in with you for a little while? Sounds of breaking glass, Jerry dropped his bottle.
MORTY What was that?
JERRY Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're gonna move in here?
MORTY Because the Costanzas are moving into Del Boca Vista.
JERRY But it's a big complex.
MORTY You don't understand, you gotta have a buffer zone.
JERRY All right, fine. Come over here.
GEORGE What?
JERRY They're not going back to Florida. They're moving here.
GEORGE What? Why?
JERRY Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone just went from twelve hundred miles down to two feet! You gotta do something.
GEORGE Hey, I'm sorry, you had your buffer zone for many years. It's my turn to live, baby.
JERRY You know what you're doing, don't you? You're killing Independent Jerry! I gotta go see my Uncle Leo. I think he may have made a big mistake.
LEO Move back with Lydia?
JERRY C'mon, you're lucky to have anybody.
LEO Last week you told me I was in my prime, I should be swinging.
JERRY Swinging? What are you, out of your mind? Look at you, you're disgusting. You're bald, you're paunchy, all kinds of sounds are emanating from your body twenty-four hours a day. If there's a woman that can take your presence for more than ten consecutive seconds, you should hang on to her like grim death. Which is not far off, by the way.
LEO But she's an anti-Semite.
JERRY Can you blame her?
HELEN You don't think he minds us staying here, do you?
MORTY Why would he mind? We're his parents.
ELAINE Oh.
HELEN Hi Elaine.
ELAINE Hello. Jerry's not here?
HELEN No.
ELAINE Huh. Oh my god.
HELEN What?
ELAINE A poppy seed! It must have been in the chicken. Oh, I'm dead. I'm going to the doctor's in a half an hour.
HELEN Why?
ELAINE It's a long story.
HELEN Just a second, I have to go to the bathroom.
ELAINE What are you gonna do in there?
HELEN What am I gonna do in the bathroom?
ELAINE You gotta do me a favor.
HELEN Elaine, I really--
ELAINE Hold on a second. Mrs. Seinfeld, I need your sample.
HELEN You want my urine?
ELAINE I need a clean urine sample from a woman.
HELEN I don't know.
ELAINE Oh please, Mrs. Seinfeld, please?
HELEN Well, what am I gonna do it in?
ELAINE Well, one of those glasses.
HELEN Jerry's glasses?
ELAINE Yeah, he won't mind. C'mon, you're his mom. Helen, Oh, I could uh-- Should I use a coffee cup?
ELAINE Yeah, a coffee cup's fine.
HELEN Or maybe a juice glass.
ELAINE Yes, fine, fine, a juice glass is perfect.
HELEN This one is kind of scratched.
ELAINE It doesn't matter.
HELEN Howbout A milk glass.
ELAINE A milk glass, a juice glass, any glass, just pick a glass.
HELEN Jerry doesn't wash these very well.
ELAINE Mrs. Seinfeld, pick a glass! Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld!
SALESMAN All right, I got everything here. I got the Cyclone F series, Hydra Jet Flow, Stockholm Superstream, you name it.
JERRY What do you recommend?
SALESMAN What are you looking for?
KRAMER Power, man. Power.
NEWMAN Like Silkwood.
KRAMER That's for radiation.
NEWMAN That's right.
KRAMER Now, what is this?
SALESMAN That's the Commando 450, I don't sell that one. What about thi-
KRAMER Well that's what we want, the Commando 450. Salesman, Nah, believe me. It's only used in the circus. For elephants.
NEWMAN We'll pay anything. We've got the What about Jerry?
KRAMER He couldn't handle that, he's delicate.
HELEN It's nice being back at Leo's Jerry's place was too small.
MORTY First Leo breaks up, then he goes back. What the hell's going on?
MORTY Who is it?
SUPER It's the super. We're installing new low-flow showerheads in all the bathrooms.
MORTY Low flow? I don't like the sound of that.
PETERMAN So as a result of your test being free of opium, I am reinstating you.
ELAINE Oh! Yes! What a load off. So when are we going to Africa?
PETERMAN I'm afraid I can't take you.
ELAINE What? Why not?
PETERMAN Elaine, according to your urine analysis, you're menopausal. you have the metabolism of a sixty-eight year old woman.
ELAINE But I wanted to see the bushmen.
PETERMAN Oh, and one more thing. You may have osteoporosis.
JERRY Well, it's been a great visit.
MORTY Jerry, I'll tell ya. The first thing I'm gonna do when I get back to Florida is take a shower.
JERRY Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move. They couldn't bear being away from George.
HELEN George must be happy about that.
JERRY You have no idea.
FRANK Take my swim trunks. I won't need them.
ESTELLE What does he want with your swim trunks?
FRANK Why should they go to waste?!?
JERRY It seems like whenever these office people call you in for a meeting, the whole thing is about the sitting down. I would really like to sit down with you. I think we need to sit down and talk. Why don't you come in, and we'll sit down. Well, sometimes the sitting down doesn't work. People get mad at the sitting.You know, we've been sitting here for I don't know how long. How much longer are we just going to sit here? I'll tell you what I think we should do. I think we should all sleep on it. Maybe we're not getting down low enough. Maybe if we all lie down, then our brains will work.
GEORGE I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would that be a terrible thing? "How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for you?"
JERRY I know what you mean.
GEORGE Do ya?
JERRY It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.
GEORGE Same thing!
JERRY Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you.
GEORGE Excuse me. Are you using your catsup?
WOMAN What do you think? You want to give him the catsup?
MAN It's up to you.
WOMAN You know what? I don't think so. I'm going to need it from time to time.
JERRY So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies?
GEORGE Nah - what for?
JERRY To see a movie.
GEORGE I've been to the movies.
JERRY Not this movie.
GEORGE They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of it.
JERRY Did you shower today?
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.
GEORGE When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my 15 minutes!
JERRY Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health.
GEORGE Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it for me anymore. I'm sick of health.
WOMAN All right, we're done. You can have it now.
GEORGE Oh, very gracious.
MAN Nice day
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY What is that?
KRAMER Hey! JoJo!
JERRY Ey, ey!
ELAINE All right, thanks for the ride, Kramer.
KRAMER No, thank you. So what are you doing?
JERRY Nothing.
KRAMER Come on, let's go to the beach.
GEORGE What are you crazy?
KRAMER What? It's a beautiful day.
JERRY Have a good time.
KRAMER Yeah, there's something in the air today. You feel it? There's something in the air.
JERRY You know you're turning into Burt Lancaster?
KRAMER Yeah, there's something in the air.
ELAINE Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going to call you back.
JERRY Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?
ELAINE What? No good?
JERRY Faux pas.
ELAINE Faux pas?
GEORGE Big hefty stinking faux pas.
ELAINE Why?
JERRY You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying "I don't want to take up any of my important time in my home so I'll just get it out of the way on the street."
GEORGE On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make.
JERRY It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.
GEORGE It's dismissive.
JERRY It's pompous.
GEORGE Why don't you think before you do something?
ELAINE Here's a thought - Bye bye.
GEORGE Too much?
GEORGE Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should know better than that.
JERRY Hey - hey - hey!
GEORGE What?
JERRY Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend.
GEORGE You're so uptight.
JERRY Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket. We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party.
PHONE_TAPE Jerry, this is Elizabeth Clark calling from James Kimbrough's office at NBC. Could you please give us a call? Thanks.
JERRY Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi? Uh huh, really, uh, no problem, definitely, ok, buhbye. That was James Kimbrough.
GEORGE Who's he?
JERRY He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about "Jerry."
GEORGE Our show, "Jerry"?
JERRY Right.
GEORGE "Jerry", oh my God. He wants to talk about "Jerry"?
JERRY Yeah!
GEORGE When?
JERRY Today, like right now.
GEORGE Right now? "Jerry"?
JERRY "Jerry"!
GEORGE He wants to talk about "Jerry"?
JERRY He wants to talk about "Jerry"!
GEORGE "Jerry"!
JERRY "Jerry"!
GEORGE Can I go like this?
JERRY Sure!
GEORGE No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets.
JERRY Forget the sports jacket.
GEORGE I won't feel like a writer.
JERRY You're not a writer.
GEORGE Right!
GEORGE Water. Need some water! Water here!
JERRY Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time.
GEORGE Don't worry, don't worry, no scenes.
JERRY Don't blow this.
GEORGE I will not blow this.
JERRY If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts.
GEORGE It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing.
JERRY He might not want nothing.
GEORGE Something, nothing, I could care less.
JERRY He might want a show about anything and everything.
GEORGE Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm down!
JERRY All right.
RECEPTIONIST Mr. Kimbrough is ready to see you
GEORGE Magic time.
JERRY What?
RECEPTIONIST Mr. Kimbrough.
STU Hey, Jerry, good to see you.
GEORGE Hey, hey, hey!
STU How you been?
JERRY Good, good. You remember George.
STU George, good to see you.
GEORGE Hello Stu.
STU You remember Jay Crespi.
GEORGE Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?
STU This is James Kimbrough.
KIMBROUGH Nice to meet you, pleasure, thanks for coming in.
GEORGE Kimbrough.
JERRY Don't spell.
GEORGE k-i-m-b-r-o-u-g-h
KIMBROUGH That's right.
GEORGE It's a talent I have.
KIMBROUGH Why don't we sit down, glad you're here.
GEORGE Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp - it's crispy crisp.
JERRY Shut up, George.
KIMBROUGH Can I get you anything?
GEORGE What do we have in the fruit department?
JERRY Oy.
STU Pineapple.
GEORGE Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the end. You can get killed from one of those things.
KIMBROUGH Anyway, let me tell you why I called. When I took over here last month, I reviewed what was in development,and it was pretty much same old, same old.
GEORGE Been there, done that.
KIMBROUGH Right. I was looking for something different. Something that would have people talking at the water coolers.
GEORGE Water coolers?
CRESPI We call it a water-cooler show.
JERRY Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right?
GEORGE See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines.
JERRY Well it's probably just easier to say "water cooler show" than "coffee machine show."
GEORGE It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use bottles.
JERRY But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.
KIMBROUGH Anyway, Stu here started telling me about a show, "Jerry", that he developed five years ago.
STU I have always loved it.
KIMBROUGH He said it was a show about nothing. So, I saw the pilot and I've got to tell you - I flipped out.
CRESPI He totally flipped out.
KIMBROUGH What I want to do is put it on the air. 13-episode commitment. Start it off on Wednesday night, build up an audience. This show needs time to grow. I love that Kramer guy.
JERRY He's a little off the wall.
CRESPI Oh yeah.
STU Kramer.
KIMBROUGH And Elaine - I wouldn't mind seeing something happening between you two.
JERRY Definitely.
GEORGE I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about.
KIMBROUGH Or we could not do the show altogether, how about that?
GEORGE Or we could get them together. Woo!
GEORGE Yeah!
JERRY Yeah!
ELAINE Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was just calling to see how your fa.. I'm sorry, I'm getting another call. Hang on just a second. Hello?
JERRY Hi. Elaine, it's me.
ELAINE Jerry, I'm on the other line.
JERRY No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.
ELAINE I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the emergency?
JERRY The "Jerry"'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to California!
ELAINE That's the emergency?
JERRY Did you hear what I said?
ELAINE I was on the other line talking to Jill.
JERRY Jill? Well, why didn't you say so?
ELAINE You said it was an emergency.
JERRY So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone walk-and-talk.
HELEN Congratulations, they're doing the show.
MORTY They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network. Can I tell you something, Jerry? It's all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six.
HELEN She's not six-six.
MORTY Jerry, you ever watch that?
JERRY Yeah, it's pretty good.
ESTELLE They picked up the show?
GEORGE I'm moving to California.
FRANK Oh baby-doll, this kid's going places, I told you.
ESTELLE The NBC guy liked it?
GEORGE Of course he liked it.
ESTELLE He told you he liked it?
GEORGE He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it.
ESTELLE Well, what are you doing?
GEORGE I'm writing.
ESTELLE You know how to write?
FRANK Without the writing, you have nothing. You're the ones that make them look good.
ESTELLE Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything.
GEORGE Ma?!
ESTELLE I don't know how you're going to write all those shows. And where are you get all the ideas?
FRANK Would you leave him alone? You'll shatter his confidence!
GEORGE I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.
ESTELLE Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty stupid to me.
JERRY NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's fantastic! Thanks. Great. Okay, bye.
KRAMER Oh hey!
JERRY Hey - how was the beach?
KRAMER Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas
JERRY I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?
KRAMER You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear.
JERRY So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, "Jerry"? Well, the new guy at NBC wants to do it. They're putting it on the air! They're giving us a 13-episode commitment. George and I are moving to California!
KRAMER You're moving to California?
JERRY Yeah, only for a while.
KRAMER Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for years! You might never come back.
JERRY No, I'll be back.
KRAMER Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a virgin, she's a whore.
JERRY And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California.
KRAMER Fling!
ELAINE So we can go anywhere we want?
JERRY Anywhere.
ELAINE Why are they doing this?
JERRY I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their shelf for five years.
ELAINE This is all very exciting.
GEORGE So? Where are we going?
KRAMER I say Japan.
ELAINE Why Japan?
KRAMER Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine art of fishing - or baking.
ELAINE Oh - I got it - how about Russia?
JERRY Russia, it's so bleak.
ELAINE It's not bleak - it's springtime.
JERRY It's still bleak.
ELAINE You can't be bleak in spring.
JERRY You can be bleak in spring.
GEORGE If you're bleak, you're bleak.
ELAINE What about Switzerland?
KRAMER Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?
GEORGE It's a bit hilly - no?
ELAINE You're not going to do any walking.
GEORGE What if I want to walk around a little?
ELAINE So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.
GEORGE What if I'm at the bottom?
ELAINE All right! You know what, just forget it!
JERRY Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to agree on anything. Why don't we all just go to Paris?
ELAINE I'll go to Paris.
GEORGE Me too.
KRAMER Oh yeah - oui oui.
JERRY So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris.
GROUP Yeah!
ELAINE Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call Jill one more time before we go.
JERRY Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that conversation.
ELAINE Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?
JERRY First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting face-off, now you're talking about a plane call?
ELAINE All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris.
NEWMAN Hello, Jerry.
JERRY Hello, Newman. What gives?
NEWMAN I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private jet to Paris?
JERRY Yeah, that's right.
NEWMAN Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you know I'm one-quarter French.
JERRY Really.
NEWMAN Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you, but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles. She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple postal worker.
JERRY That's a shame.
NEWMAN Take me! Take me!
JERRY Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!
NEWMAN All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my words, Seinfeld - your day of reckoning is coming. When an evil wind will blow through your little playworld, and wipe that smug smile off your face. And I'll be there, in all my glory, watching - watching as it all comes crumbling down.
CAPTAIN Ah, Jerry?
JERRY Yeah.
CAPTAIN I'm Captain Maddox this is my co-pilot, Kurt Adams. Ready to go to Paris?
JERRY All set. We'll just grab the bags.
CAPTAIN Don't worry about that. We'll take care of them for you.
JERRY Just keeps on getting better and better.
JERRY Not bad.
ELAINE Wow!
KRAMER The only way to fly.
GEORGE This is it?
GEORGE I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a lot nicer.
JERRY You're complaining about a private jet?
GEORGE You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?
JERRY Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.
GEORGE Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one.
ELAINE Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.
GEORGE This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough.
JERRY You're not writing any letters!
ELAINE Will you turn around?
GEORGE Why?
ELAINE You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.
GEORGE It's effeminate to sit like this?
ELAINE Yes, I think it's a little effeminate.
GEORGE How is this effeminate?
ELAINE I don't know - it just is.
GEORGE Kramer, what are you doing?
JERRY Still got water in your ear?
KRAMER Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.
GEORGE Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.
KRAMER I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore.
GEORGE Kramer, don't be fooling around up here.
GEORGE Kramer!
CAPTAIN Hey, get the hell out of here!
ELAINE What is that?
GEORGE Oh my God!
ELAINE What is that noise? What is that noise?
JERRY Kramer, what the hell did you do?
KRAMER I lost my balance.
ELAINE Oh my God!
ELAINE What's going on?
JERRY Kramer!
KRAMER It was an accident.
GEORGE I told you to stop with the hopping.
ELAINE Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!
GEORGE Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful.
JERRY Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.
KRAMER I'm ready! I'm ready! Glory hallelujah!
GEORGE Jerry? Jerry can you hear me?
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE There's something I have to tell you.
JERRY What? What is it?
GEORGE I cheated in the contest.
ELAINE What?
JERRY What?
GEORGE The contest - I cheated.
JERRY Why?
GEORGE Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.
JERRY Great - I won.
ELAINE Jerry, I gotta tell you something too.
JERRY Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you.
ELAINE No no - me first.
JERRY Alright.
ELAINE Jerry, I've always loved ..u..
GEORGE Hey - What's going on?
KRAMER We're straightening out!
ELAINE We're straightening out?
JERRY We're straightening out!
GEORGE We're straightening out!
GROUP Yeah!
CAPTAIN Well, again, sorry about that little mishap. But once you get everything checked out there shouldn't be anymore problems.
JERRY Where are we?
CAPTAIN Latham, Massachusetts. Why don't you take a cab into town, get yourself something to eat. I got your beeper number - I'll beep you as soon as we're ready.
JERRY Okay.
ELAINE Okay.
JERRY We'll see you later.
ELAINE Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get back on this plane?
JERRY I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight.
GEORGE I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane.
ELAINE Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class.
GEORGE First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough, tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the good one - the Ted Danson plane.
JERRY Alright, I'll feel him out.
GEORGE Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up.
STRANGER Nice day.
JERRY Another one?
ROBBER Alright fatso, out of the car.
KRAMER I want to capture this.
ROBBER Come on! Gimme your wallet.
VICTIM Don't shoot.
JERRY Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
ELAINE See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know? They can't really chase ya!
GEORGE He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
ROBBER I want your wallet. Come on. Come on, come on.
JERRY That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.
VICTIM Officer, he's stealing my car! Officer, I was carjacked. I was held up at gunpoint! He took my wallet, everything!
JERRY Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane.
KRAMER All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out.
ELAINE Forget it.
JERRY No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat in Sticksville.
OFFICER All right, hold it right there.
KRAMER What?
OFFICER You're under arrest.
JERRY Under arrest? What for?
OFFICER Article 223-7 of the Latham County Penal Code.
ELAINE What? No, no - we didn't do anything.
OFFICER That's exactly right. The law requires you to help or assist anyone in danger as long as it's reasonable todo so.George: I never heard of that.
OFFICER It's new. It's called the Good Samaritan Law. Let's go.
ELAINE The Good Samaritan Law? Are they crazy?
GEORGE Why would we want to help somebody?
ELAINE I know.
GEORGE That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.
KRAMER The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.
ELAINE Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is.
DEPUTY Well, they just passed it last year. It's modeled after the French law. I heard about it after Princess Diana was killed and all those photographers were just standing around.
JERRY Oh, yeah.
ELAINE Oh, yeah.
DEPUTY You're the first ones to be arrested on it, probably in the whole country.
GEORGE All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and get the hell out of here.
DEPUTY Well, it's not that easy. Now see, the law calls for a maximum fine of $85,000 and as much as five years in prison.
ELAINE What?
GEORGE Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV show.
DEPUTY California? Oh gosh, I don't think so. Yeah, my guess is you're gonna be prosecuted. Better get yourselves a good lawyer.
CHILES Who told you to put the cheese on? Did I tell you to put the cheese on? I didn't tell you to put the cheese on.
SECRETARY Jerry Seinfeld on the phone.
CHILES You people with the cheese. It never ends. Hello? Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. Good Samaritan Law? I never heard of it. You don't have to help anybody. That's what this country's all about. That's deplorable, unfathomable, improbable. Hold on. Suzie, cancel my appointment with Dr. Bison. And pack a bag for me. I want to get to Latham, Massachusetts,right away.
PROSECUTOR So they got Jackie Chiles, huh?
D.A._HOYT Uh huh. You know what that means. This whole place is going to be swarming with media by the time this thing is over. You're not going to be able to find a hotel room in this town. The whole country is going to be watching us. Now we got to do whatever it takes to win it, no matter what the cost. The big issue in this trial is going to be character. I want you to find out everything you can about these people - and I mean everything.
GEORGE ...pianist. A classical pianist. She plays the piano. She's a brilliant woman. I-I-I sat in her living room... She played the Waldstein Sonata! The Waldstein!
GEORGE We did a crossword puzzle together, in bed. It was the most fun I ever had in my entire life. Did you hear me? in my life! Y'know?
JERRY Were you talking? I couldn't hear anything.
GEORGE I was telling you about Noel.
JERRY Oh, Noel! Yeah, the one who plays bongos...
GEORGE Heh heh heh... So side-splittingly funny...
JERRY All right, I'm sorry. What about her?
GEORGE What, you think I'm going to repeat the whole thing now?
JERRY I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.
GEORGE No everything is not going good. I'm very uncomfortable. I have no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. Once in my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand at all. She has the hand; I have no hand...
GEORGE How do I get the hand?
JERRY We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the hand right from the opening.
GEORGE She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School. You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets, you and Elaine could go...
JERRY Yeah, that sounds like somethin'...
GEORGE Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself. Maybe I can get some hand that way.
KRAMER Hey, smell my arm... Smell it!
GEORGE With all due respect, I don't think so...
JERRY That smells good, what is that?
KRAMER The beach!
JERRY The beach?
GEORGE What, did you go swimmin'? It's 29 degrees out!
KRAMER I just joined the Polar Bear Club.
JERRY You joined the Polar Bears?!
GEORGE What the Hell is a "Polar Bear"?
KRAMER Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's invigorating....
JERRY Yeah... So's shock therapy.
JERRY What is that, a Pez dispenser?!
KRAMER Want one? Yeah, I just bought it at the Flea Market.
GEORGE Hey, what goes on there, exactly?
JERRY You don't know?
GEORGE No, I-I-I know... I know...
JERRY You think they have fleas there, don't you?
GEORGE No...
JERRY Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a Flea Market, and you think they have fleas there.
GEORGE All right, I think they have fleas there. So what...
ELAINE I don't know how anyone does this. It must be so nerve racking... How do they warm up their fingers?
JERRY They have a piano backstage they warm up on.
ELAINE No, we would have heard it.
JERRY What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?
GEORGE I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet.
JERRY I resent that you said that! That's directed at me, isn't it?!
JERRY Is this okay? Can I do this?
STEVE Something I said? It's John... Mollika.
ELAINE Oh, oh, John... Oh, hi John... Hi...
STEVE What're you doing down here?
ELAINE Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I started laughing.
MOLLIKA Jerry's in there? I heard you guys broke up.
ELAINE We did. We're just hanging out.
MOLLIKA Really. ... You really look great.
ELAINE Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel?
MOLLIKA Oh, Richie, he's been doing comedy in L. A. for a few years. He just got back a month ago. He's kind of messed up. On drugs. I don't know what to do for the guy.
ELAINE Have you thought about an intervention?
MOLLIKA What's that?
ELAINE You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now.
MOLLIKA He'd never listen to anyone. ... Except of course Jerry. He'd listen to Jerry. Jerry would have to be involved. He really respects Jerry.
ELAINE I'm sorry. George, I'm sorry!
GEORGE What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first place?
JERRY I dunno, it was an impulse.
GEORGE What kind of a sick impulse does that??
JERRY How could I know she would start to laugh?
ELAINE I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I am!
JERRY Can we just go in already?
GEORGE What are we gonna tell her?
ELAINE I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.
GEORGE No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then I'm a jerk...
ELAINE Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later.
JERRY What about?
GEORGE Hey, hey! We're discussing something!
JERRY I know, but I'm distracted now.
GEORGE What are you? A baby!? All right. Tell her.
ELAINE When I was outside I ran into John Mollika.
JERRY Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club. How's he doing?
ELAINE He's good.
GEORGE Uh, can we cut to the chase?
JERRY "Cut to the chase"?
GEORGE Yeah...
JERRY What're you, "Joe Hollywood"?
GEORGE A lot of people say it.
JERRY I would lose that.
GEORGE What's that?
JERRY "Lose that"? That's not a Hollywood expression!
GEORGE ...Yes it is.
ELAINE Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told him that he should do an intervention.
JERRY Really, an intervention ...
GEORGE Y'know people, we got a situation over here!
ELAINE Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it.
JERRY Me? Why me?
ELAINE 'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.
JERRY Y'know these things are really hard to load...
GEORGE All right, ok, I'm goin' in.
JERRY We've got to talk about this
ELAINE All right.
GEORGE Hi, hi, hi, You were wonderful.
NOEL No..
GEORGE Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel
JERRY You play a Hell of a piano.
ELAINE Yeah, I was really moved, really moved.
NOEL Well didn't you hear that person laughing? I couldn't play. I was humiliated...
ELAINE Well, I'm sure it wasn't at you.
NOEL Well then, what was she laughing at?
JERRY Pez?
NOEL Uh, no, No thank you. Did you see her?
GEORGE Me, uh, uh, no, ...
JERRY Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.
ELAINE Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.
JERRY Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.
NOEL I'll never forget that laugh for the rest of my life.
ELAINE I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.
GEORGE If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful
GEORGE All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something to eat.
NOEL I don't feel like it tonight.
JERRY We'll be outside
ELAINE Yeah
JERRY It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your fingers before you play?
NOEL I just crack my knuckles.
GEORGE We'll have a good time
NOEL I don't feel like it
GEORGE Ah, come on
NOEL I said I don't feel like it!
GEORGE Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. I'll call you and we'll talk on the phone. A telephone communique. Every thing is fine ok, uh, fine, ..
JERRY You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.
ELAINE What? How?
JERRY A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable. Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead and does it.
ELAINE So? What happened?
JERRY What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia, and a month later he was dead.
ELAINE Shut up!
JERRY All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.
ELAINE Whar about Kramer?
JERRY He's the same!
JERRY Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye. Remember Ricie Appel?
KRAMER Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?
JERRY Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. We're having it here.
KRAMER Can I get in on that?
JERRY What do you think? It's like a poker game?
KRAMER Is Elaine going?
JERRY Yeah
KRAMER Well, I knew him as well as she did.
JERRY Yeah, but John invited her.
KRAMER So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?
JERRY No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening.
GEORGE It's George
JERRY Stop smelling your arm.
KRAMER You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just came home from the beach
JERRY Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, "That's not a bad idea."
KRAMER Tell me about it!
JERRY Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein. In fact he's a good friend of John Mollika and Richie also.
GEORGE Well it's over. It's definitely over.
JERRY She broke up with you?
GEORGE No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation. I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of things to talk about.
JERRY What was on the list?
GEORGE Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink,
JERRY Yeah, Postum is under-ratted,
GEORGE Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said "no, maybe we could get together for lunch." You know what that means.
JERRY What's wrong with lunch?
GEORGE Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted. I'll never do another crossword puzzle with her again. I know it.
KRAMER I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?
GEORGE I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have no hand.
KRAMER Break up with her
GEORGE What?
KRAMER You break up with her. You reverse everything that way.
JERRY A preemptive breakup.
GEORGE A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got nothing to lose. We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go out with some Dignity. Completely turn the tables. It's absolutely brilliant.
GEORGE So, I am have to going to break up with you.
NOEL You're breaking up with me?
GEORGE I, ... am breaking up with, ... you.
NOEL Wow.
GEORGE Shocked?
NOEL I really am.
GEORGE Never expected this did you?
NOEL I thought everything was fine.
GEORGE Well, live and learn.
NOEL I don't understand. You're breaking up with me. Didn't we have fun doing the crossword puzzles?
GEORGE Kind of.
NOEL I'm very confused.
GEORGE Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid.
NOEL I thought,...
GEORGE Now, stop it ...
NOEL What do you want, I can make you happy.
GEORGE When you're playing the piano do you think about me?
NOEL I don't know.
GEORGE This is what I'm talking about.
NOEL Ok, I'll think about you.
GEORGE All the time.
NOEL All the time? ... Ok, All the time.
GEORGE I can't hear you.
NOEL All the time. All the time.
GEORGE See, It's not so hard.
KRAMER Go ahead smell, smell
STEVE Yeah, so?
KRAMER Do you recognize it? ... The beach.
STEVE What are you talking about?
KRAMER Oh, I'm talking about the beach.
STEVE What about it?
KRAMER You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach? Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that smell. Oh yeah.
STEVE That is the dumbest idea I have ever heard.
KRAMER Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?
STEVE Do you think people are going to pay $80 a bottle to smell like dead fish and sea weed? That's why people take showers when the come home from the beach. It's an objectionable offensive odour.
KRAMER So you don't think it's a good idea?
GUY The membranes get dried and it just starts bleeding. Since I was a kid so I have to stick tissue up there
ELAINE Uh, you have to work like that?
GUY Nobody minds Nobody has ever said anything to me.
OTHER_GUY Are there any ice cubes?
JERRY In the freezer.
OTHER_GUY I looked. There aren't any ice cubes.
JERRY Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.
OTHER_GUY I can't drink this. It's warm!
GUY Shouldn't we rehearse this a little bit before Richie comes?
STEVE What's the plan?
JERRY Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking.
OTHER_GUY Well, if he's not going to talk I'm not going to talk either.
GUY No, we all have to talk.
ELAINE What's the order?
GUY We'll go in alphabetical order. First Roberta.
ROBERTA Why am I first?
ELAINE Albano is your last name.
ROBERTA That's not my name any more. I'm divorced.
STEVE I'll go first.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER Is this the interference?
JERRY Intervention.
OTHER_GUY What are you doing here?
KRAMER Uh, is it all right if I stay for the intervention?
STEVE Hey, this is for close friends only.
KRAMER I'm a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade over Marty Benson's head?
OTHER_GUY Let him stay.
KRAMER Hey, you know I got someone to make up that cologne for me, big mouth.
STEVE Somebody's going to make that crap?
OLD_GUY Kramer!
KRAMER Hey, come on, these are some of my polar bear buddies.
OTHER_GUY They can't stay.
OLD_GUY We're having a party here?
JERRY No, we're having an intervention
OLD_GUY An intervention? Who's intervening?
JERRY There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront him.
OLD_GUY Sure, we used to do that when one of our polar bears stopped coming. We would go to his house and say, "What you don't want to be a polar bear anymore? It's too cold for you?"
GUY It's him.
ROBERTA What should we do?
ELAINE Hide!
JERRY It's not a surprise party! Yeah
GEORGE It's George
JERRY Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him.
GUY If you don't go out with me it's because I'm a bar tender.
ELAINE Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now.
GUY Is it because I have a tissue in my nose?
ELAINE You're getting warm.
GEORGE We just came from Chadway's What's going on.
JERRY We're having the intervention for Richie.
GEORGE Oh, right, right, the intervention. Should we leave?
JERRY Well, uh..
NOEL Elaine, hi.
ELAINE Oh, hi Noel
JERRY Well, you're looking well.
GEORGE Jerry, let me tell you something, "A man without hand is not a man." I got so much hand I'm coming out of my gloves. I got to thank Kramer.
STEVE Even if I were dragged through manure I still wouldn't put that stuff on.
GEORGE This man is a genius. Genius!
STEVE You think so?
GEORGE I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to talk to you
OLD_MAN The male kangaroo doesn't have a pouch only the female has it. The male has pouch envy.
ELAINE 
OLD_GUY at least give me a pocket.
ELAINE 
NOEL That laugh. That's the laugh. That's it. You're the one.
ELAINE No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. It was Jerry. Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg.
NOEL You put a Pez dispenser on her leg during my recital?.
JERRY I didn't know she would laugh.
NOEL You lied to me George, you lied to me.
GEORGE No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you going?
NOEL I ... am breaking up ... with you!
GEORGE You can't break up with me. I've got hand.
NOEL And you're going to need it.
JERRY Hey Richie
RICHIE So what's going on?
JERRY It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, He's hostile, he's talking back.
GEORGE I can't do these puzzles.
JERRY So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the coffee table
GEORGE Ah ah Pez dispenser.
JERRY He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father, and his father was trying to load one of them
GEORGE Well they're hard to load.
JERRY Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying to load it he loses control of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobody's hurt but Pez is all over the car. And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition.
GEORGE Poor kid.
JERRY So as he's telling the story he starts crying.
GEORGE What did you do?
JERRY What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser.
GEORGE Wow
JERRY Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday. He's doing great on the rehab. He's hooked on Pez. He's eating them like there's no tomorrow.
GEORGE What's a three letter word for candy?
JERRY I can't do those things.
JERRY The cosmetic surgery procedures that are available to people today - liposuction, are you familiar with this? This is a fat-sucking machine. Now you know, somewhere, somebody is working on a way that this thing could go into a restaurant. And you could just order it off the menu. 'I tell you what, give me the cheesecake, crank me up to nine, and put a scoop of ice cream on the side.'
SIDRA Oh, hi Jerry.
JERRY Hi, Sidra. I usually last about ten minutes on a Stairmaster. Unless of course there's someone stretching in front of me in a leotard, then I can go an hour.
SIDRA Really.
JERRY Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a Stairmaster. You get up there and you stare.
SIDRA Well, I'm done. I think I'm gonna go take a sauna.
JERRY Alright, I'll see you Thursday night, right?
SIDRA Thursday night.
JERRY Alright. Elaine walks over to Jerry.
ELAINE Good workout?
JERRY Tremendous workout.
ELAINE That's a pretty girl.
JERRY Tremendous girl.
ELAINE She's the one you went out with last night?
JERRY Yeah. I really like her.
ELAINE You know, uh...they're fake.
JERRY What? Don't say that!
ELAINE Nah! They're fake!
JERRY How do you know?
ELAINE I can tell. You know how you're always bragging how you can spot a lesbian?
JERRY I'm not bragging, I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye. Hi, how ya doin.'
ELAINE Oh, right. C'mon, don't you think they seem a bit too perfect?
JERRY Yes, they do!
ELAINE I never knew you were so into breasts. I thought you were a leg man.
JERRY A leg man? Why would I be a leg man? I don't need legs. I have legs. Have you ever seen her naked in the locker room?
ELAINE No.
JERRY Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony. Maybe if you had seen her naked.
ELAINE I don't want to see her naked.
JERRY Well, I do.
ELAINE Well, that's your problem.
JERRY Look, you made the allegation. The least you could do is follow up.
ELAINE Jerry, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna go in there and spy on her in the sauna?
JERRY Yes! Go in there! Do a little investigative journalism. I need to know!
ELAINE But a few more dates and you can find out for yourself!
JERRY Don't be so sure. Look at George - he's on his ninth date with Betsy, he still hasn't gotten anywhere with her.
ELAINE What's his problem?
JERRY Well, every time he tries to make a move, something screws up. Like on their last date, they were on the couch, but she was sitting on his wrong side.
ELAINE Wrong side?
JERRY Yeah, she was on his right side. He can't make a move with his left hand. Can't go left.
ELAINE He can't go left.
JERRY No! I'm lefty, can't go right. What about women? Do they go left or right?
ELAINE Nah, we just play defense.
GEORGE Can I ask you a question? Would you mind switching seats?
BETSY Oh, actually, I really prefer to sit here. I don't hear very well out of this ear so, I always try to sit to the right of people.
GEORGE I'll shout.
BETSY Well, I really think I feel more comfortable here.
GEORGE C'mon, c'mon... See, now, is that so bad?
BETSY What?
GEORGE No, no, the machine'll get it...
BETSY No, no, it's not on...
GEORGE They'll call back.
BETSY But George, what if it's an emergency?
GEORGE In the whole world right now, there's maybe three emergencies. Why would you think, on this entire planet, that you're one of those three?
BETSY George, please. Hello? What? Oh my god!
GEORGE Alright, maybe four.
ELAINE Boy, I'm really sweatin.' Good sweat, beads of sweat...sweatin' bullets. Look at her. I don't need to see her naked to know those aren't real. Why does she need to tie the towel around her? She's got a rack on her chest. Oh god! Sidra's takin' the towel off! Whoa, doctor! That's it, I knew it! I knew it, they're definitely fake.
BETSY So, when's the funeral? Well, Aunt Clarice was so ill, I guess it was really a blessing. Yeah, I'll fly home as soon as I can. O.k. You, too. Get some sleep.
JERRY You're sure?
ELAINE Positive! This chick's playin' with confederate money.
JERRY Well then, that's it. That's the end of that.
ELAINE What? Just 'cause of that?
JERRY Just 'cause of that? It's like finding out Mickey Mantle corked his bat!
ELAINE Oh, come on! You've dated women with nosejobs, what's the difference?
JERRY You don't touch the nose! You don't aspire to reach the nose. You don't unhook anything to get to a nose, and no man has ever tried to look up a woman's nostril.
ELAINE You've put a lot of thought into this, haven't you?
JERRY Well, I take it very seriously.
ELAINE You know, sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey. You know, I do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like.
KRAMER Well, I know what they feel like.
JERRY You? How do you know?
KRAMER Well, I lived in Los Angeles for three months.
ELAINE I thought you hated Los Angeles.
KRAMER I do! I just miss the warm weather, y'know? Jeez. Oh man, I wish I could get away.
JERRY Real busy now down at the office?
KRAMER No. Huh? You know who I saw at the health club? Salman Rushdie.
ELAINE Yeah right, Salman Rushdie. Yeah well, I can see that - you got five millions Moslems after you, you wanna stay in pretty good shape.
GEORGE I know what the problem is - I like her too much. That's why I can't make a move.
JERRY You put her on a pedestal.
KRAMER I put them on a dental chair.
JERRY He puts 'em on a dental chair.
GEORGE I'm not her boyfriend. I want to be her boyfriend.
KRAMER Whoo. It's like a sauna in here.
GEORGE That's funny. You're a funny guy.
JERRY Yeah, funny. Yeah, I never heard that before. So, you goin' to the funeral?
GEORGE Why, you think I should?
JERRY What, are you kidding? It's a golden opportunity to advance the relationship. She's crying, you put your arm around her and console her...you're the consolation guy!
GEORGE I'm the consolation guy...?
KRAMER Consolation Guy is big.
JERRY Her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you.
KRAMER It's like ten dates in one shot.
JERRY This confers upon you instant boyfriend status. The family's there...you're taking care of things...you're gettin' the sandwiches...you're the rock!
GEORGE It's in Detroit though, it's an expensive flight.
KRAMER Why don't you get a "death in the family" fare?
GEORGE What?
GEORGE Really?
KRAMER In fact, listen...I'll go down there with ya. You know, we'll tell them there's a death in my family, you buy the ticket, I'll split it...then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll get to Detroit for a quarter of the price!
ELAINE Boy, I'm gettin' a good sweat here. Great sweat, good beads. Nice beads. Ah, look who's here. "Silicon Valley."
SIDRA So anyway, we go out on one date, he asks me out for a second, then out of nowhere he cancels the date and says he doesn't want to see me again.
ELAINE Uh...sorry, I couldn't help overhearing.
SIDRA Oh, that's o.k.
ELAINE Did he give you a reason?
SIDRA Yeah. He's going back to his old girlfriend.
ELAINE Really?
SIDRA He said she's mentally ill. He's one of those guys who is obsessed with neatness and order? Everything has gotta be just so. He would have made a great Nazi.
ELAINE Hey, does he ever talk about Superman?
SIDRA Yes! How did you know?
ELAINE Oh, I know the type.
SIDRA So you can relate?
ELAINE Oh, yeah.
SIDRA You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcy.
ELAINE Oh, hi. I'm Elaine.
ELAINE So anyway, I stood up to shake her hand, then suddenly I lost my balance and I fell right into her.
JERRY You fell on her?
ELAINE I touched 'em.
JERRY You what?
ELAINE I...touched...'em.
JERRY You touched 'em?!
ELAINE I needed them to help me break my fall! If it hadn't been for them, I could have really injured myself!
JERRY Wow.
ELAINE Anyway...they're real.
JERRY Excuse me?!
ELAINE I think they might be real.
JERRY Oh, what do you know, you have no breast touching experience.
ELAINE I've touched mine!
JERRY So have I.
ELAINE Oh, right...I forgot.
JERRY Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert.
ELAINE Alright, well anyway, I think they're real. And if they are, I must say they are...spectacular.
JERRY Aw, what are you doin' to me?
GEORGE You see, my friend here, his aunt passed away last night.
CLERK Oh, I'm very sorry.
KRAMER I saw her last week, she looked healthy and peaceful, but...she knew...
CLERK You poor thing!
KRAMER i...i...
GEORGE You don't think you can buy the ticket yourself...? No, there, there...you sit, and I'll purchase the ticket for you.
CLERK You're a good friend.
CLERK Yes, all you have to do is pay the full fare now, then return to any one of our counters with a copy of the death certificate, and we'll refund half your fare.
GEORGE The death certificate?
CLERK Yes, yes, we do need documentation or you know, people could take advantage.
GEORGE What kind of a sick person would do a thing like that?
CLERK I know! But it happens.
GEORGE You want my friend to ask his uncle, a man who just lost his wife of 44 years, for a death certificate so that he can save a few bucks on a flight?
CLERK That would be $387 round-trip.
KRAMER Alright, so you'll need my frequent flyer number, huh?
CLERK Yes.
JERRY I don't know, one minute you say they're fake, the next minute you think they're real...I don't know what to believe!
ELAINE Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only one who's touched 'em.
JERRY But you were just grabbing on to them to save your life. If you were drowning and I threw you a life preserver, you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable?
ELAINE I wouldn't have said anything if I knew you were going to stop seeing her!
JERRY Well, I don't mind someone with a phony personality, but I gotta draw the line somewhere.
KRAMER Hey!
JERRY Hey. George off to Detroit?
KRAMER Yep! And, in two days, I'm off to Puerto Rico.
ELAINE Hey Kramer, by the way, I saw that guy at the health club...that is not Salman Rushdie.
KRAMER Pffft - wrong.
JERRY There's Sidra.
KRAMER There's Salman.
JERRY Where?
KRAMER Talkin' to that woman.
JERRY Talkin' to Sidra?
KRAMER If that's Sidra, she's talkin' to Salman.
JERRY I don't think that's Salman.
KRAMER Well, I don't think they're real.
JERRY If that's Rushdie, they're real.
KRAMER If they're real, that's Rushdie.
JERRY Well, I gotta know - I'm talkin' to Sidra.
KRAMER I gotta know, I'm talkin' to Salman.
KRAMER It's like a sauna in here, huh? I feel like I'm...back at the desert.
SALMAN You've lived in the desert?
KRAMER Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've uh...I've spent a little time in the Mideast. You ever been to the Mideast?
SALMAN Yes, I've been there.
KRAMER My name's Kramer.
SALMAN Sal Bass. Pleased to meet you, Kramer.
KRAMER So, uh...what kind of work do you do?
SALMAN I'm a writer.
BETSY Have you met my boyfriend George?
AUNT_MAY No!
BETSY George, this is Aunt May, and Father Jessup. Oh, and that's my brother, Timmy. This is my boyfriend, George.
AUNT_MAY Oh George, how nice of you to come all this way.
GEORGE Well, I'm the boyfriend. Otherwise, what's the point of being the boyfriend? This is where you have to be when you're the boyfriend.
AUNT_MAY Betsy, dear, have you had anything to eat?
BETSY I'm not very hungry.
AUNT_MAY They have some very nice snacks.
FATHER_JESSUP I'm about to get myself a snack.
GEORGE Oh, no, no, no...you sit right here...I will get you a nice snack.
FATHER_JESSUP This is my third wake this month. It never gets any easier.
GEORGE Well, losing a loved is, uh...I mean, forget about it.
FATHER_JESSUP You seem to be of great comfort to Betsy, we're very appreciative.
GEORGE Oh - comfort, schmomfort. Listen, Father, can I ask you a question? In a terrible time like this...who would I get the death certificate from?
KRAMER C'mon Jerry!
JERRY Oh, how can you be so sure?
KRAMER Jerry, are you blind? He's a writer. He said his name was Sal Bass. Bass, Jerry! Instead of salmon, he went with bass! He just substituted one fish for another!
JERRY Look, you idiot, first of all, it's Salman, not salmon!
KRAMER Jerry, Jerry, you're missing the big picture!
JERRY Alright, maybe it is, but listen, I gotta get ready - Sidra's coming over in a few minutes, so if you don't mind...
KRAMER What, did you ask her?
JERRY I'm gonna find out tonight.
KRAMER Oh, yes indeed...
DR._ALLENWOOD Why do you need a death certificate?
GEORGE Well, Dr, Allenwood, uh...I was hoping to compile an - admittedly, rudimentary - scrapbook of her life. Something that Betsy could have, and hold onto.
DR._ALLENWOOD Well, I suppose I could make a copy of it.
GEORGE Oh, that would be wonderful.
DR._ALLENWOOD It was very nice meeting you, George.
GEORGE Likewise.
TIMMY What are you doing?
GEORGE What?
TIMMY Did...did you just double-dip that chip?
GEORGE Excuse me?
TIMMY You double-dipped the chip!
GEORGE "Double-dipped"? What are you talking about?
TIMMY You dipped the chip. You took a bite. And you dipped again.
GEORGE So...?
TIMMY That's like putting your whole mouth right in the dip! From now on, when you take a chip - just take one dip and end it!
GEORGE Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...but I don't dip that way.
TIMMY Oh, you don't, huh?
GEORGE No. You dip the way you want to dip... I'll dip the way I want to dip.
TIMMY Gimme the chip! Gimme the chip!
SIDRA I don't know what I'm doing here, I must be crazy.
JERRY Hey, would you mind switching seats?
SIDRA Why?
JERRY Oh, I don't know...I just like sitting to the left of people, makes me feel like I'm driving.
SIDRA ok....
JERRY How ya doin'?
SIDRA Good. How you doin'?
JERRY Good, feel good...you know that Jayne Mansfield had some big breasts. Really big, huge...just coming out the top of her dress, they were like, chokin' her.
SIDRA I hear that's how she died.
JERRY Have you noticed that women today are, you know, they seem...bigger.
SIDRA Well, a lot of women are having them done.
JERRY Really?
SIDRA Yeah.
JERRY How do you like that.
SIDRA A lot of people ask me if I've had mine done.
JERRY Aw, you know people.
SIDRA It gets a little tiring, it's really none of their business.
JERRY Oh, the nerve. You know, some people have asked me if you've uh, done that.
SIDRA What do you tell them?
JERRY Whatever you want me to tell them.
SIDRA Well, I think you'll find out soon enough. Aren't you going to get that?
JERRY No.
SIDRA What if it's an emergency?
JERRY Oh, there's no emergency...
KRAMER Jerry! C'mon, it's an emergency!
JERRY Excuse me. Alright, what is it? You're interrupting!
KRAMER Well, you know, I'm packing for Puerto Rico, I need to borrow your bathing suit.
JERRY This is an emergency? You need a bathing suit?
KRAMER Well, I like yours.
JERRY I don't know, my bathing suit? That's a little familiar, I don't want your...your boys down there.
KRAMER C'mon, what's wrong with my boys?
JERRY Your boys should stay in their neighborhood.
KRAMER Alright, c'mon!
JERRY Alright. It's in the top drawer. Hurry up.
ELAINE Hi, Jer.
JERRY Oh, hi, Elaine.
ELAINE Oh...hi, Sidra -
SIDRA Hi...Elaine?
JERRY What are you doing here?
ELAINE I'm looking for Kramer.
KRAMER Yeah, she was just showing me pictures of places I can visit when I go to Puerto Rico...you know, when you two went down there?
JERRY Oh. yeah. Alright. So, where were we?
SIDRA I was just leaving.
JERRY Right, you were leaving.
SIDRA I can't believe you sent a woman into the sauna to do that.
JERRY That was an accident!
SIDRA I think you're both mentally ill. And by the way...they're real, and they're spectacular.
BETSY Stop it, George! Get out! Get out! I never want to see you again!
DR._ALLENWOOD Go back to New York! Get out!
CLERK_2 Alright sir, now all I need is a death certificate and you'll be on your way.
GEORGE Well, you see, what happened was...the doctor - the very same doctor that was attending to my late aunt - suffered an untimely stroke, and lost the use of his right hand, so...obviously I was unable to get the death certificate. However, I do have this.
CLERK_2 What's this?
GEORGE That's a picture of me next to the coffin.
CLERK_2 Nice try.
GEORGE Not even close, huh?
GEORGE Oh, what's the point? When I like them, they don't like me, when they like me, I don't like them. Why can't I act with the ones I like the same way I do with the ones I don't like?
JERRY Well, you've only got another fifty years or so to go before it'll all be over...
GEORGE Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak English.
JERRY Yeah, how about a mute?
GEORGE A mute would be good.
JERRY Ah, where you gonna meet a mute?
GEORGE This is what my life has come to... Tryin to meet a mute.
GEORGE I dunno, Jerry somethin's missing. There's a void, Jerry, there's a void...
JERRY A deep, yawning chasm...
GEORGE There's gotta be more to life than this. What gives you pleasure?
JERRY Listening to you. I listen to this for fifteen minutes and I'm on top of the world. Your misery is my pleasure.
ELAINE Hey boys!
JERRY Hey! How you doin'?
ELAINE Good. Okay, well, it's all set. I start tomorrow.
GEORGE Start what?
ELAINE I signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens.
GEORGE Really.
ELAINE Yeah. God, I can't tell you how I feel! I mean, I feel so good! I really feel good. The strange thing is, I mean, I haven't even met the woman yet.
GEORGE Volunteer work, huh?
JERRY What're you gonna do down there?
ELAINE Well, they say all it is is that you go over to their apartment and, I dunno, you take them for a walk and you get a cup of coffee and it's supposed to make them feel good.
JERRY That's what I do with him
GEORGE When did you get this idea?
ELAINE Last time I had lunch with you here. You were going on and on and on about how you wanted to meet somebody who didn't speak English.
JERRY What, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on me?
GEORGE And... and anybody can do this?
ELAINE Yup.
GEORGE Helping people... Of course. Of course! It makes perfect sense! How could I not be doing this!? I am gonna help somebody, Dammit!
ELAINE What about you?
JERRY Nah, it's not for me.
ELAINE Jerry, if anybody should be doing this, it's you.
GEORGE What kind of a person are you?
JERRY I think I'm pretty much like you-- only successful.
AGENCY_REP This is a wonderful thing you're doing. They're so grateful just to have someone to talk to. And I can tell you that everyone who participates finds the experience extremely rewarding.
GEORGE Well, I feel better already. I'm feelin' like a good person.
AGENCY_REP Good luck.
JERRY Thank you.
GEORGE Hey, what's your guy's name again?
JERRY Fields. Sidney Fields. 87 years old. 87. How about your guy?
GEORGE Ben Cantwell. 85. Huh... You think we'll make it to that age?
JERRY We? No.
KRAMER So what's up, Diggity Dog?
JERRY George and I just signed up with the Senior Citizen's Volunteer Agency. Same thing Elaine's doing.
KRAMER Oh, that's too bad. Now don't say I didn't try to warn you.
JERRY What're you talkin' about?
KRAMER Oh, Jerry, I'm surprised at you!
JERRY What?
KRAMER It's a con. These agencies are usually a front for some money laundering scheme. Or they're bunko artists; bilkin' people out of their life savings, oh yeah.
JERRY Where do you get this?
KRAMER The alternative media, Jerry. That's where you hear the truth.
NEWMAN Kramer?! Kramer!? Where are you? Kramer!?! Kramer!!?
KRAMER I'm in here. C'mon...
JERRY Hello, Newman...
NEWMAN Jerry, George. So, did you ask him about the records?
KRAMER Well--
JERRY What records?
KRAMER Well, Newman and I are going partners selling used records.
NEWMAN You know Ron's Records down on Bleeker? They pay big cash for used records!
KRAMER Yeah, so we thought if you had any of those big, y'know, old- fashioned useless records, y'know, just... lyin' around--
KRAMER Y'know, we'd take them off your hands, free of charge.
GEORGE Let me ask you something. What do you do for a living, Newman?
NEWMAN I'm a United States postal worker.
GEORGE Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a gun and shoot everybody?
NEWMAN Sometimes...
JERRY Why is that?
NEWMAN Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and coming and coming, there's never a let-up. It's relentless. Every day it piles up more and more and more! And you gotta get it out but the more you get it out the more it keeps coming in. And then the bar code reader breaks and it's Publisher's Clearing House day!!!
RON I'll give you five bucks.
KRAMER Five bucks???
NEWMAN Well, you know how much those records are worth!?
RON Yeah, I do... Fi' dollars.
NEWMAN Those records are worth more than five dollars!
KRAMER He's gyppin' us...
NEWMAN You're gyppin' us!
RON Well, whattya got here, y'know, you got "Don Ho: Live At Honolulu", you got "Jerry Vale Sings Italian Love Songs" you got Sergio Mendes, now come on...
KRAMER Wait, wait, wait... Sergio Mendes has a cult following.
NEWMAN They follow him like a cult.
KRAMER He can't even walk down the street in South America...
RON Look, that's his problem, alright? Now you don't like it, too bad.
KRAMER I don't like it...
NEWMAN I don't like it.
RON Well, then get the Hell out of my store, alright? You bring me something decent, I'll give you some money.
KRAMER Alright, well be back, jack.
NEWMAN Alright, well be back... jack!
JERRY Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.
HOUSEKEEPER Agency?
JERRY Yeah, is this Sid Field's residence?
HOUSEKEEPER Sid Fields.
SID What the Hell is it?
JERRY Mr. Fields?
SID What!?!
JERRY Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.
SID Agency? What agency? The CIA?
JERRY No, no, the--
SID Who let you in here?
JERRY The woman, she--
SID Oh her. She steals from me. Steals my money. She says she doesn't speak English. My ass she doesn't speak English. Plays that freakin' "voo-doo" music, tries to hypnotize me. She thinks she's gonna turn me into a zombie and then rob me blind. Well, I wasn't born yesterday. I may drop dead today, but I sure as Hell wasn't born yesterday. Now get the Hell out of my house...
JERRY Mr. Fields, I'm here to spend some time with you.
SID Oh, really. Are you the boyfriend? I know she's got a boyfriend. Are you going to kill me? I'm an old man for crying out loud, you gonna kill an old man, you coward?!?
JERRY No, Mr. Field, look, really I'm--
SID I can't read that you fool...
JERRY What's all this stuff?
SID Trash. Garbage.
JERRY You're throwin' this out??
SID I believe that's what you do with garbage, you idiot.
JERRY You don't want any of this?
SID Well if I wanted it I wouldn't be throwing it away, Ein-stein.
JERRY You know I have some friends who would really like to have these.
SID Well, take it. I'm sure as Hell not going to give it to my family.
JERRY Well, do you want to go out for a walk, get a cup of coffee...
SID With you? I'd rather be dead.
JERRY Well, maybe I'll get goin' then. I just remembered I got an appointment to get my, um, tonsils out.
SID Good. Thank God. Good riddance. Oh listen, before you go, would you mind changing my diaper? HAA!!
BEN No, I feel great for 85.
GEORGE Y'know the average life span for an American male is like, 72. You're really... kinda pushin' the envelope there.
BEN I'm not afraid of dyin'. I never think about it.
GEORGE You don't? Boy, I think about it a lot. I think about it at my age. Imagine how much I'll be thinkin' about it at your age. All I'll do is keep thinkin' about it until it drives me insane...
BEN I'm grateful for every moment I have.
GEORGE Grateful? How can you be grateful when you're so close to the end? When you know that any second-- Poof! Bamm-O! It can all be over. I mean you're not stupid, you can read the handwriting on the wall. It's a matter of simple arithmetic, for Gods sake...
BEN I guess I just don't care.
GEORGE What are you talking about? How can you sit there and look me in the eye and tell that me you're not worried?! Don't you have any sense?!! Don't you have a brain!? Are you so completely senile that you don't know what you're talkin about Anymore!!?!
GEORGE Wait a second, where are you going?
BEN Life's too short to waste on you.
GEORGE Wait a minute, please--
BEN Get out of my way...
GEORGE But Mr. Cantwell, you... you owe me for the soup...
ELAINE Mrs. Oliver?
MRS._OLIVER Yes my dear.
ELAINE Ooh!
MRS._OLIVER What's the trouble? Are you alright?
ELAINE Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah.
MRS._OLIVER It's my goiter, isn't it?
ELAINE Did you say goiter? What goiter?
MRS._OLIVER This football-shaped lump jutting out the side of my neck.
ELAINE Oh, that goiter. Hey... Heh heh heh... Whaddya know...
MRS._OLIVER Does it bother you?
ELAINE Bother me? Oh, phhbt... Why would a little goiter like that bother me? No, not a bit. It's nothing. It's nothin', it's um, in fact, it's um, it's very distinctive, y'know? Um, I mean you want to know something? I, I wish I had one. Really.
JERRY C'mon Elaine, it's just a goiter...
ELAINE I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't look the woman in the face. I mean I keep thinkin' that that goiter's gonna start talkin' to me... You'd think they'd mention that before they send you over there. "Oh, by the way, this woman almost has a second head". But no, no, I didn't get any goiter information.
JERRY They really should mention that in the breakdown: height, weight, goiter.
ELAINE Y'know you try to do some good. You want to be a good person but this is too much to ask.
JERRY Yeah, well, I'll tell ya, I'd rather talk to a goiter with a nice disposition than the nut they sent me to.
ELAINE Hey Georgie, what happened with your guy?
GEORGE I don't think it's gonna work out...
JERRY Whattya mean?
GEORGE He fired me.
JERRY He fired you?!?
ELAINE How do you get fired from a volunteer job?
GEORGE I dunno. I was just talking to the man and he walked out on me!
JERRY Well, I dunno about you two, but I'm quitting. I hate my guy. He's a mean, mean guy.
ELAINE I wish I could quit...
JERRY So quit!
GEORGE Yeah, I'm a great quitter. It's one of the few things I do well. I come form a long line of quitters. My father was a quitter, my grandfather was a quitter... I was raised to give up.
KRAMER Well, here's your albums
JERRY What happened?
NEWMAN Five dollars. He offered us five dollars.
KRAMER Hey, what kind of stuff are you listening to? You embarrassed me at that store.
NEWMAN That guy thought we were a couple of total squares.
JERRY Oh yeah, you and your Sergio Mendes...
KRAMER Hey, hey, hey, hey, that guy can't even go to the bathroom in South America!
JERRY Well you shoulda seen the pile of albums this old guy I was Jolson, Benny Goodman...
KRAMER Wait, wait, wait, now... He's throwin them out??
JERRY Yeah, and then I asked him if my friend could have them and he said yeah. Kramer Okay...
NEWMAN The old coot's sittin' on a mountain of gold!
KRAMER Yeah...
JERRY But you're going to have to go get em. I'm not carryin' them all.
KRAMER Yeah, but you've gotta come with us.
JERRY Yeah, I'm goin' there today. In fact you should see this house keeper he's got. She's from Senegal Wild, Wild, Stuff...
GEORGE Senegal?
GEORGE So you don't speak any English at all?
HOUSEKEEPER English? No.
SID Hey, what are those bums doin' back there?
JERRY Well you said they could come and take the records.
SID It's like watchin' a couple of hyenas goin' through the garbage.
GEORGE You don't speak any English?
HOUSEKEEPER No English.
GEORGE I would like to dip my bald head in oil and rub it all over your body. You don't understand! It's a miracle! You don't understand because you don't speak English!
JERRY So Mr. Fields I just don't know if this arrangement is--
SID Hey, I don't like what's goin' on around here. I want all you bums outta here.
KRAMER Now calm down, Mr. Fields...
SID Now don't tell me to calm down... Get your hands off of me! Why you little...
KRAMER Oooow! He's biting me!
SID My teeth! My teeth!
JERRY Where's his teeth! Where's his teeth!
GEORGE I thought I saw something fly over here...
JERRY Well turn the light on...
JERRY That's the garbage disposal!
SID My teeth! You idiots!!!
MRS._OLIVER And we would take long automobile trips--
ELAINE Oh, well, that sounds like a lot of fun...
MRS._OLIVER Staring out the window--
ELAINE Uh huh...
MRS._OLIVER You'd see a long view of rolling pastures and--
ELAINE Well, that'll get you goin' right there...
MRS._OLIVER Big, roaming cows--
ELAINE Cows, well that's fascinating...
MRS._OLIVER That's when I began my affair with Mohandas.
ELAINE What?
MRS._OLIVER Mohandas.
ELAINE Ghandhi?
MRS._OLIVER Oh, the passion. The forbidden pleasure--
ELAINE You had an affair with Ghandhi?
MRS._OLIVER He used to dip his bald head in oil and rub it all over my body. Here, look...
ELAINE Oh, my God... The Mohatma?
RON Twenty bucks.
NEWMAN Twenty bucks?!? Are you out of your mind?
RON Well, take it or leave it.
NEWMAN Take it or leave it!? We got Al Jolson here, Al Jolson!!
RON Now what the Hell do I care about Al Jolson. I'd just assume her you sing "Mammy". Heh heh heh...
KRAMER This guy's nothin' but a piece of crap...
NEWMAN You are nothing but a piece of crap.
RON Pardon me?
KRAMER A piece of crap...
NEWMAN A piece of crap.
KRAMER I find you extremely ugly...
NEWMAN I find you extremely ugly.
RON Do you?
KRAMER You emit a foul and unpleasant odour...
NEWMAN You emit a foul and unpleasant odour.
RON Oh, is that right?
KRAMER I loathe you...
NEWMAN I loathe you.
RON That's it. Get out of my store!
KRAMER Make us.
NEWMAN Make us!
RON Oh, I'll make you!
AGENCY_REP Do you realize how irresponsible this is? Our agency's sole purpose is to care for senior citizens. And in one fell swoop you've single- handedly destroyed our reputation.
JERRY Yes, but--
JERRY Yes?
TIM It's Tim Fields, Mr. Fields' son.
JERRY Alright, c'mon up.
JERRY I dunno what happened, we were just trying to take him to the dentist.
AGENCY_REP Why were you taking him to the dentist?
JERRY Um, well, his false teeth got mangled up in the garbage disposal--
AGENCY_REP What were his false teeth doing in the garbage disposal?
JERRY Well, after he bit my friend--
AGENCY_REP Bit your friend?!
TIM What the Hell is going on here? How do you lose a human being?!
JERRY I, I'm sorry.
TIM And who were these other people. What were they doing in the apartment!?
JERRY Well, I brought them up there to take his records--
TIM Take his records? Do you realize how valuable that record collection is?
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY There you are. Did you find him?
KRAMER No, y'know we took the old man's records over to Ron's and he tried to screw us so we got in a fight.
NEWMAN It was a real melee.
KRAMER Yeah, a real brouhaha...
JERRY Yeah. Yeah. All right. Uh-huh. Chinese food!
GEORGE Who was it?
JERRY I did a show for a car dealership and they're getting me a new saab.
GEORGE What about your old car? They couldn't get Kramer's blood out of it?
JERRY No, the engine clotted. You know who set this whole thing up for me? Frank Merman.
GEORGE Fragile Frankie Merman? I never liked that guy.
JERRY Why? He's harmless.
GEORGE Every summer you guys went to camp together. I was jealous. Felt like he was the summer me.
JERRY He was not the summer you. Besides, you had a summer me. Whitey Fisk, the guy who snuck you into Last Tango in Paris.
GEORGE I made him up.
JERRY So you never saw Last Tango in Paris?
GEORGE No.
JERRY Too bad. It was erotic. jackbooted thugs!
JERRY 'Pottery Barn'?
KRAMER I got three 'Pottery Barn' catalogs in one day. That makes eight this month.
JERRY Why don't you just throw 'em out?
KRAMER Oh, no. I've been saving them up here in your apartment. And now, it's payback time. 'Pottery Barn' is in for a world of hurt. phones. So you wanna grab a bite?
GEORGE I can't. I gotta make the weekly call to the folks.
JERRY So call now.
GEORGE I gotta prep. I need a couple of anecdotes, a few you-were-right-abouts. It's a whole procedure. Wasn't Fragile Frankie the one that used to run into the woods every time he got upset?
JERRY That's him.
GEORGE Is he still nuts?
JERRY What do you think? They gave me a new car for thirty minutes of 'So, who's from out of town?' or what?
ELAINE Mmm. De-lish.
PUDDY Delish?
ELAINE Delish. You know, short for delicious.
PUDDY Oh, like scrump.
ELAINE Yeah.
PUDDY I'm gonna be late. See ya later.
JACK Excuse me, can I borrow your ketchup?
JACK Thank you.
GEORGE Hey, it's Georgie.
ESTELLE Let me put your father on the phone.
GEORGE Ma!
FRANK Who is this?
GEORGE Dad, it's me. Hey, listen, I was at Fortunoff's the other day, and, you know what, you were right.
FRANK Sorry, George, our Chinese food just came. Talk to you later.
GEORGE Chinese food? sending out catalogs!? How do you like gettin' 'em back!?
JERRY So, maybe they had Chinese food?
GEORGE After dark? Please. At their age, that's like swallowing stun grenades.
JERRY Well, there's one way to check. Where there's Chinese food, there's leftovers.
GEORGE That's dynamite. Yeah, I'll look for the Chinese food leftovers.
ELAINE Hey, hey, hey! I met this guy! And it was like this, totally unreal, fairy tale moment.
JERRY It wasn't Whitey Fisk, was it?
ELAINE Oh, George's friend. Whatever happened to him?
GEORGE Nothing. Uh, I don't know. I gotta go.
JERRY So, this is beautiful. You, and Puddy, and this new guy, in a big pot of love stew.
ELAINE Oh, yeah... Puddy. Well, I won't fire him until I see if this new guy can... handle the workload. 'Omaha Steaks', 'Mac Warehouse', 'Newsweek'?! I can't stop all these companies, so, I'm gonna attack this problem at the choke point.
JERRY Stop the mail?
KRAMER That's... even better!
FRANKIE Jerry!
JERRY Hey, Frankie! So, where's the car?
FRANKIE This is it.
JERRY Inside the van?
FRANKIE It is the van! Don't you remember, we always talked about how cool it would be to have a van and just drive?
JERRY We were ten.
FRANKIE Come on. Let's take it for a spin.
JERRY I don't want a van.
ELAINE Well, just tell him you want the saab.
JERRY You don't understand. This is Fragile Frankie Merman. When we were in camp, if you upset him, he'd run out to the woods, dig a hole, and sit in it.
ELAINE Well, I have an idea. Keep the van, and get a bumper sticker that says, 'If this vans a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.'
JERRY Always helpful.
ESTELLE Oh, Georgie, what are you doing here?
GEORGE Just dropped in for a visit. You, uh, you never called me back.
ESTELLE Uh... the phone broke.
FRANK Well, we got to get moving.
GEORGE What? Where are you going?
FRANK We have a catered affair.
GEORGE You're going like that? suspicious.
JACK Elaine, I'm sorry I'm late.
JACK I'm gonna be in the can.
ELAINE Okay, Jack.
CASHIER Sure. right. Again.
JERRY Aye, aye.
FRANKIE Oh, there's a spot. Just back up.
JERRY Hold on. There must be a truck backing up.
FRANKIE No, that's us.
JERRY Great. You know, Frankie, I was wondering. What if I decided that it's silly to drive a van, because, you know, I live in New York City. Is there maybe some way I could exchange it?
FRANKIE You don't like the van?
JERRY No, no, no. Just hypothetically.
FRANKIE I gotta go to the park.
JERRY No! No, you don't! No woods. I love the van. I'm a van guy. them, but let's see them get by... these bricks.
JERRY Where'd you get the bricks?
KRAMER Jerry, the whole building is brick.
JERRY So you want to take a ride with me out to Jersey? I'm gonna try to sell the van to a lot.
KRAMER A dealer? Are you insane? No, take out an ad. Sell it privately.
JERRY I don't think I want to meet the people that are in the market for a used van.
KRAMER Come on, Jerry, just let me help you.
JERRY ok.
KRAMER All right! Ok! Right, here we go. Yeah. Ok, so... 'For sale. A big, juicy van.' And, ooh, you gotta put down, 'interesting trades considered.'
JERRY I don't want to trade.
KRAMER No, you don't have to. It's all about tickling their buying bone.
JERRY Hey, you know what? This is all your mail. They're puttin' it in my box now.
KRAMER Oh, that's it. They have gone too far. They keep pushing me, and pushing me. Now I got no choice but to go down there... and talk to them.
ELAINE Hey, Jerry. I'd like you to meet someone. This is Jack. Heraldic harp sounds as Jerry looks at Jack's face
POSTAL_EMPLOYEE May I help you?
KRAMER Yeah, I'd like to cancel my mail.
POSTAL_EMPLOYEE Certainly. How long would you like us to hold it?
KRAMER Oh, no, no. I don't think you get me. I want out, permanently.
NEWMAN I'll handle this, Violet. Why don't you take your three hour break? Oh, calm down, everyone. No one's cancelling any mail.
KRAMER Oh, yes, I am.
NEWMAN What about your bills?
KRAMER The bank can pay 'em.
NEWMAN The bank. What about your cards and letters?
KRAMER E-mail, telephones, fax machines. Fedex, telex, telegrams, holograms.
NEWMAN All right, it's true! Of course nobody needs mail. What do you think, you're so clever for figuring that out? But you don't know the half of what goes on here. So just walk away, Kramer. I beg of you.
SUPERVISOR Is everything all right here, Postal Employee Newman?
NEWMAN Yes, sir, I believe everything is all squared away. Isn't it, Mr. Kramer?
KRAMER Oh, yeah. As long as I stop getting mail!
ESTELLE Oh!
GEORGE Quick for a... catered affair.
FRANK I don't know what you mean.
GEORGE You ditched me. That's twice. Now I demand to know what's going on!
FRANK George, we've had it with you. Understand? We love you like a son, but even parents have limits.
ESTELLE The breakups, the firings. And every Sunday with the calls.
FRANK What my wife is trying to say is that this is supposed to be our time.
GEORGE I'm not following.
FRANK We're cuttin' you lose.
GEORGE You're cuttin' me loose?
FRANK Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to make love to your mother.
GEORGE They don't want to see me anymore!
JERRY But this is what you've always wanted.
GEORGE It is. I'm just not ready yet.
JERRY Aw, that's kind of sweet.
GEORGE Ah, shut up, Jerry. My parents think they can ignore me. Heh heh. Well, they better think again.
JERRY Oh, no. George, please. What are you going to do?
GEORGE You remember my cousin Rhisa? I'm gonna date her.
JERRY Mother of God.
GEORGE One little wink. She'll freak out, tell my parents. They'll be all over me. Who is this guy?
JERRY That guy Elaine's dating seems really familiar to me. I think he may have been a comedian I worked with one time. Wait a minute, what is this? On the TV, Jack is The Wiz, the spokesman for Nobody Beats the Wiz, chanting Nobody beats me, because I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!
JERRY That is the guy!
GEORGE Elaine's in love with the Wiz guy?
JERRY No, she thinks she's in love with him. But she's just remembering this old commercial.
GEORGE That's pretty pathetic.
JERRY I know. They're not even related.
GEORGE Uh... hey. I'm gonna get going.
JERRY Hey, have fun at the... family reunion. So, what do you know about this Jack fellow?
ELAINE Isn't he the best?
JERRY Yeah, nobody beats him. What kind of work does he do?
ELAINE Oh, right now he's a fact checker for New York Magazine. It's not much, but it has a certain type of quiet dignity. this?
ELAINE Oh, no.
JERRY Oh, yes. come on buy.
RHISA Yeah, thanks.
GEORGE Sure. You know, Rhisa. I've always found you... very attractive.
RHISA What?
GEORGE I know it may sound shocking. But, I just can't stop myself from... wanting you.
RHISA You want to borrow money, right?
GEORGE No, no. I-I just want us to be... together.
RHISA All right.
GEORGE All right?
RHISA Let's go for it.
GEORGE Well... we could dance around it a little first.
GEORGE Whoa! Whoa! Geez!
JERRY You know why I'm selling it. I hate it.
KRAMER How many miles?
JERRY Two.
KRAMER City or highway?
JERRY Look, do you really want to buy this thing, or what? pressured. I'll walk away right now. Is this thing bent? I'm not paying for that.
JERRY All right, just get out of here.
KRAMER All right, look. I'm going to be honest. I'm very interested in the van.
JERRY OK, fine. 'What do I have to do to put you in this van today?' But it says right here, 'interesting trades considered'.
JERRY You put that in!
JERRY You want to trade me an undershirt?
KRAMER No, I want to trade you screen legend Anthony Quinn's undershirt. He took this off to do sit-ups in the park and I nabbed it.
JERRY That's disgusting.
KRAMER Well, it's my final offer.
PUDDY You dumped me for some idiotic TV pitchman.
ELAINE Look, I'm sorry, Puddy. It-it was a mistake. So, let's just put it behind us, and we can continue like this never happened.
PUDDY Gee, I don't know. What if we're out somewhere and you see the Maytag repairman.
ELAINE You're not taking me back?
PUDDY That's right.
ELAINE He's not idiotic. He's the Wiz. And nobody beats him. Nobody... on. Hey, mail blows. Fax it to a friend.
WOMAN Why does this dummy have a bucket on its head?
KRAMER Because we're blind to their tyranny.
WOMAN Then shouldn't you be wearing the bucket?
KRAMER Yeah. Move along, Betty.
FRANKIE Is this, uh, Jerry Seinfeld's van?
KRAMER Well, not anymore. He traded it to me for some Hollywood memorabilia.
FRANKIE I'm, uh, I'm so stupid.
KRAMER What?
KRAMER Yeah, nice to meet you.
JERRY She's into it?
GEORGE She's leaving me dirty messages on my answering machine.
JERRY So have your parents found out about it?
GEORGE She wants to keep it quiet. She... thinks we have a real future together.
JERRY Brave new world, alright.
JERRY Hey, how's the anti-mail campaign going?
KRAMER Oh, it's fantastic. We were out in front of the post office today, and not one person went in.
JERRY It's Sunday.
GEORGE Why is the mailman wearing a bucket?
KRAMER Huh? Well, it symbolizes our persecution.
GEORGE Then... shouldn't you be wearing the bucket.
JERRY Hey, I want my van keys back.
KRAMER Oh, well. I, uh, thought we made a deal for Quinn's t-shirt.
JERRY Are you insane? Give 'em to me.
KRAMER No, I can't, I can't. See, I told Frank he could borrow it. Yeah, he wants to move some of George's stuff into storage.
GEORGE Wait a minute? He's picking up the van tonight? This is perfect. I'll drive Rhisa to someplace romantic. Then when my father slides the door open, I'm in the van kissing his brother's daughter.
KRAMER Oh, listen, Jerry. One of your friends came by and he was very upset that I had your wheels.
JERRY Oh, no, not Frankie.
KRAMER Well, I didn't catch his name, but then he went running into the park.
JERRY Oh, no, the woods! The hole!
NEWMAN Kramer, what the hell are you doing?
KRAMER I know, I'm gonna switch the bucket to something else.
NEWMAN Not that!
KRAMER What?
NEWMAN You're in trouble, Kramer. I shouldn't even be talking to you, but walking. Maybe on a crisp, autumn day just like today. When a mail truck will slow beside you, and a door will open, and a mailman you know, maybe even trust, will offer to give you a lift.
KRAMER Are you through?
NEWMAN No! And no one will ever see you again!
KRAMER Are you through?
NEWMAN Yes. No, wait! ok, yes. in!
KRAMER Oh, no, no, no. That's exactly how you said it was going down.
NEWMAN There's another way it can go down, and it's going down right now!
KRAMER No. You said a mailman I know, and you're a mailman I know!
NEWMAN I know you know, but you don't know what I know.
JERRY Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie, is that you?
HOLE_DIGGER My name is Edgar.
JERRY Have a nice night.
HOLE_DIGGER Thank you.
RHISA All right, George. I'm ready.
GEORGE Yeah, hold on. I'm, uh, I'm just trying to get a reading on my dashboard compass. Where are my parents?
RHISA Geor-gie... Seinfeld's van? Seinfeld's van? Seinfeld's van?! he saying?
GEORGE I think he's saying 'Son of Sam'! Oh, my God!
RHISA No, they caught him.
ELAINE So I told him, 'Hit the road. I'm going back with Jack.'
JACK Elaine, that's the second piece of good news today.
ELAINE Really, what was the first? again.
ELAINE What?
JACK I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!
ELAINE Well what, what about your fact-checking job?
JACK Oh... here's a fact. Uh, I'm... the Wiz! I'm the Wiz and noooobody beats me! there.
FRANKIE You hate the van.
JERRY But I'm keeping it. As much as I hate the idea of being a van guy, it's much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people.
FRANKIE So, can we go for a ride?
JERRY Yeah, let's just get out of here. with that? Good. He left the door unlocked.
ESTELLE Why did Kramer have to park the van in the woods?
FRANK Isn't it obvious? There are no parking meters out here. mama!
POSTMASTER_GENERAL Oh, my goodness. What have they done to you here?
KRAMER Huh? Who are you?
POSTMASTER_GENERAL Well, you can just call me Henry.
KRAMER Henry Atkins? The postmaster general?
POSTMASTER_GENERAL Last time I checked.
KRAMER Henry... can I get out of here now?
POSTMASTER_GENERAL Oh, oh. Sit a bit. Sit a bit. I mean, after all, I drove all the way up here from D.C. just to talk to you.
KRAMER Oh?
POSTMASTER_GENERAL I even had to cancel a round of golf with the secretary of state. Do you like golf, Mr. Kramer?
KRAMER Yeah.
POSTMASTER_GENERAL Kramer, I've been, uh, reading some of your material imagine. An army of men in wool pants running through the neighborhood handing out pottery catalogs, door to door.
KRAMER Yeah! Ha ha.
POSTMASTER_GENERAL Well, it's my job. And I'm pretty damn serious about it. In addition to being a postmaster, I'm a general. And we both know, it's the job of a general to, by God, get things done. So maybe you can understand why I get a little irritated when someone calls me away from my golf.
KRAMER I'm very, very sorry.
POSTMASTER_GENERAL Sure, you're sorry. I think we got a stack of mail out at the desk that belongs to you. Now, you want that mail, don't you Mr. Kramer?
KRAMER Sure do! Kramer, seeing Newman walk into the office with a bucket on his head,
NEWMAN Tell the world my story.
JERRY Hey, George!
GEORGE Jerry! Hey, that's the guy!
JERRY What? George Costanza, Frankie Merman.
GEORGE Oh. The summer me.
FRANKIE The winter me.
JERRY You must be George's cousin.
RHISA Girlfriend.
JERRY All right.
JERRY Don't go a-knockin'.
FRANKIE Now you gotta sell this van.
JERRY Oh, yeah.
FRANK What you saw in that van was a natural expression of a man's love for his lady.
GEORGE Ohhhh...
ESTELLE Your father's right. It's beautiful.
FRANK And it was safe.
GEORGE Oh, God...
FRANK Now if you'll excuse me. Once again, your mother and I...
GEORGE Oh... make it stop.
ELAINE Hey.
JERRY Morning.
ELAINE Look, this is crazy, I can't go on like this.
JERRY But why?
ELAINE I need some space.
GEORGE Does that mean I have to go too?
JERRY You don't think she's just talking to me?
GEORGE Hey, shut up.
JERRY You shut up.
ELAINE I hate this.
KRAMER You'll get used to it. It's like a grubby scrub.
ELAINE No, I don't want this anymore.
JERRY We'll come to work with you.
GEORGE And on your dates.
JERRY And shopping.
KRAMER And to the bathroom.
ELAINE I can't breath...I'm sorry... You're killing me! 30. She realizes, that alarm comes from next door.
ELAINE Turn your alarm off!!
KRUGER Your background is impressive George, but how does it apply to what we do here, at Kruger Industrial Smoothing?
GEORGE Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over, you know, chiseling away, grinding down. In fact we used to call it 'the grind'.
KRUGER It says here that you worked at Play Now for four days?
GEORGE That should be 14, let me just...
KRUGER George, I have to honest; I could go either way with you...but what the hell, we need someone, huh.
GEORGE You won't regret this, sir.
KRUGER I don't care. Let's find you an office. Kruger's family and George on the background.
GEORGE ...and then when I saw the photo I remembered where I'd seen him; the boom box incident.
JERRY The boom box incident?
GEORGE Summer of '89 I'm at the beach. This family sits up next to me. I go in to the surfs and when I come from out, my clothes, my towel, my umbrella, they're all gone. I am furious, I start screaming to these kids demanding my stuff back and finally I lose it; I grab their boom box and I chuck it in to the ocean.
JERRY Seems reasonable.
GEORGE Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them out, not the kids.
JERRY Even more reasonable.
GEORGE So now, the father is screaming at me, he's demanding that I pay for the boom box. Finally, I gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there.
JERRY And that guy is your new boss?
GEORGE Until that stupid photo jogs his memory.
KRAMER Kruger? That's not Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it?
GEORGE Yeah.
KRAMER Grinders, sanders, wet stones. They are the ones who botched the Statue of Liberty job.
JERRY Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off.
GEORGE It is a horrible company. There's no management what so ever. I could go hog wild in there.
KRAMER You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple of days and get it air brushed.
GEORGE Like retouched.
KRAMER You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in. Got that Ford right out of there.
GEORGE Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to work for him.
KRAMER Look at this. This sandwich is terrible. Everywhere you go, they give you this misshaped shardy meat. Look at this...
KRAMER I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years.
JERRY Neither have I.
KRAMER Hey, our meat problems are solved.
JERRY Where did you get this thing?
KRAMER I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is, see that's all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide.
ELAINE Hey.
KRAMER Hey, spice. Welcome to flavor country.
ELAINE Yeah, that's pretty good.
JERRY Hey, I got a date with that doctor you met.
ELAINE Sara Sitarides?
JERRY Mmhu.
ELAINE Oh...
JERRY What's with you?
ELAINE You remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that always smells like potatoes?
JERRY Your whole building smells like potatoes.
ELAINE This jackass goes to Paris, leaves the alarm on. It's been beeping since 3:30 this morning.
KRAMER You know, that happened to Lomez, so he blew his neighbor's circuit.
ELAINE How do you do that?
KRAMER Yeah well, that's easy. Just let me finish this mile high and I'll be right with you. Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna need a case of Kaiser rolls.
JERRY I think we might have one left in the stock room.
KRAMER This hallway smells like potatoes.
ELAINE I know, I know, this is it.
KRAMER Ok, oh, you see this socket it's probably connected to her apartment. So what we'll do, we'll take this paper clip and bend it so it'll short out the entire circuit. Here you go...
ELAINE I think I'll let you do it.
KRAMER No no no. It's easy, you just...do it quickly.
ELAINE No, I really don't want to.
KRAMER Well, I don't want to either.
ELAINE I thought you had done this before.
KRAMER It's just...it's no picnic.
ELAINE Well, how are we gonna do it?
KRAMER Alright, fine fine, I'll do it.
KRAMER Oh mama.
ELAINE Are you okay?
KRAMER I will lose that nail.
SARA I enjoy the challenge of medicine. Naturally you have no idea what it's like to have someone's life depending on you.
JERRY Well, I have this neighbor...
SARA A joke. Do you have any idea how it feels like to save someone's life?
JERRY Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball?
SARA No.
JERRY Cause I hit a whopper last week!
CLERK Here you go, airbrushed in to sand and sky.
GEORGE What did you do here? You took out the wrong guy.
CLERK I thought you said you wanted to be out?
GEORGE Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy!
CLERK You've really lost a lot of hair.
GEORGE I am aware!
ELAINE_THINKING Hmm, the world's best pizza cutter. 76 bucks, how often do I make...oh, I've gotta buy a book.
ELAINE The cat.
JERRY He took out Kruger?
GEORGE I just pray Kruger doesn't realize that it's gone until this guy can fix it up.
KRAMER This slicer is indomitable.
JERRY Where did you get that butcher's coat?
KRAMER You buy enough meat, they'll give you anything.
ELAINE Kramer, my neighbor has a cat. When you blew the power, we must've shut off the automatic feeder.
KRAMER See, that's the same thing that happened to Lomez.
ELAINE What did he do about it?
KRAMER Well, he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died.
ELAINE Well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm.
KRAMER Oh, that's a prickly one.
ELAINE Yeah, how's the doctor date?
JERRY Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel, if I don't save lives, I'm worthless.
ELAINE Well, she's very focused. Dermatology is her life.
JERRY Dermatology?
ELAINE Yes, she's a dermatologist.
JERRY Saving lives? The whole profession is; eh, just put some aloe on it.
KRAMER The slicer! Elaine, let's go.
ELAINE Where are we going?
KRAMER The cat. Just grab that meat and let's ride.
GEORGE When are you going on your next date with her?
JERRY Oh, what's the point?
GEORGE What, you're gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that aloe pusher in her place?
JERRY Revenge date? That sound like you more than me.
GEORGE This good be so sweet, Jerry. Saving lives? She's one step away working at the clinique counter!
JERRY Dermatologist? Skin doesn't need a doctor!
GEORGE Of course not! Wash it, dry it, move on!
JERRY You're right. I'm gonna call her right now and tell her off.
GEORGE No no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated. You go to a fancy dinner, flowers...
JERRY Flowers?
GEORGE Yeah, you gotta do it classy
JERRY So, you've done this?
GEORGE Almost. Couldn't get the girl go out with me the second time.
KRAMER I think we are looking half a millimeter.
ELAINE Can it cut that thin?
KRAMER Oh, I've cut slices so thin, I couldn't even see them.
ELAINE How did you know you cut it?
KRAMER Well, I guess I just assumed.
ELAINE Hold on kitty, dinner's coming.
KRAMER Yeah, that's a hall of famer.
ELAINE Alright, let's do it.
KRAMER Alright, here we go. Yeah, watch that baby slide...
ELAINE Come on, come on kitty... ooh...how about that; it worked! Wow, can I borrow that thing for a while?
KRAMER Oh no, I don't think so.
ELAINE Why not?
KRAMER Well, you're not checked at on it.
ELAINE What do I have to know?
KRAMER Well, where the meat goes?
ELAINE Right there.
KRAMER Where do you turn it on?
ELAINE Right there.
KRAMER But where does the meat go?
SARA Restaurant, flowers...this is so nice.
JERRY Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business?
SARA It's fine.
JERRY It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man!
SARA What is with you?
JERRY You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD!
PARRY Dr. Sitarides?
SARA Mr. Parry, how are you?
PARRY I just wanted to thank you again for saving my life.
JERRY She saved your life?
PARRY I had skin cancer.
JERRY Skin cancer! Damn.
ELAINE You were right Kramer, this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah, yeah...no no no I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye.
ELAINE These heals are so uneven.
CLERK Here you Mr. Costanza.
GEORGE What is this? This is a drawing.
CLERK Looks real, doesn't it?
GEORGE This is a cartoon!
CLERK Hey, I had to draw that guy from memory. Considering, I think that's damn good.
GEORGE But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph!
CLERK Then you better get a camera.
JERRY He looks like a Peanuts character.
GEORGE I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo of Kruger.
JERRY You can do that.
GEORGE Without his shirt on.
JERRY You can't do that. Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you.
GEORGE It seemed so disorganized.
JERRY I understand.
GEORGE What about the Coast Guard? Seems like a lot of pride there, a lot of tradition.
JERRY True. You mean, for you?
GEORGE I think.
JERRY What about your sea sickness?
GEORGE Maybe I could be a land guy.
JERRY I don't know if they have land guys.
GEORGE Someone's have to unhook the boat before it leaves...the place!
ELAINE Pliers?
JERRY Drawer.
ELAINE Got it.
JERRY What are they for?
ELAINE I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer.
JERRY Come again?
ELAINE Okay, I got a little slicer happy, but listen; don't tell Kramer, okay? He has very strong feelings for it.
GEORGE I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go?
JERRY Eh, it went okay.
GEORGE Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy?
JERRY Yeah, I started out real classy...
GEORGE Yeah you did, you classed it up!
JERRY But then I found out about the skin cancer.
GEORGE Oh, so it backfired?
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE So, I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself.
ELAINE Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists do.
JERRY Sadly, that knowledge could've help me.
GEORGE Wait a minute, she did a skin cancer screening at Peterman?
ELAINE Aha.
GEORGE Could she do that at Kruger?
ELAINE I don't know, I guess.
GEORGE So I set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click, I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger.
ELAINE You have a little thing for this fella'?
GEORGE Jerry, you gotta talk to Sitarides.
JERRY Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her!
GEORGE And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize..
JERRY Must I?
GEORGE Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do.
JERRY How does that reflect me?
KRAMER Elaine, alright where's the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice.
ELAINE Aah, I forgot it. I gotta get home.
KRAMER Ok, I'll go with you.
ELAINE Umm, I'm not actually going straight to home, I have to first stop at the eh...circus, you know with all the...clowns.
KRAMER Oh, well you have fun... oh no clowns...hate clowns...the clowns.
JERRY So again, I'm sorry. I had no right to yell at you, you're a life saving doctor and I'm just a comedian...
SARA Jerry, enough. I'll do your friend's cancer screening, because I believe in that, but as far as you and I are concerned; it's off.
JERRY Was it pimple popper MD?
SARA That's the one.
JERRY Still got it.
ELAINE Out, damn heal!
KRAMER Elaine?
ELAINE Kramer?
KRAMER Yeah listen, I need my slicer back.
ELAINE Just hold on!
KRAMER Hey, what's going on?
ELAINE Nothing... Here, ok I'm on the phone alright? I'm on the phone with someone...
KRAMER My blade is all dinged up. Oh, come on! Elaine!
ELAINE Phone call! I'm in a big phone call!
KRAMER Come on, this is important!
NEIGHBOR Hey, get the hell out of here!
KRAMER Wow, that's a lot of potatoes.
KRAMER So, George took my slicer down to Kruger and they're smoothing it out for me.
JERRY What the hell is this?
KRAMER Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing a fake beard?
JERRY No.
KRAMER Well, what have you been doing?
JERRY Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office and apologized...
KRAMER Whoa whoa, backup, Dr. Sitarides, what happened there?
JERRY Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well...
KRAMER There, there's your hives.
JERRY What, she gave me hives?
KRAMER Jerry, as the Bible says; Thou who cureth, can maketh ill.
JERRY She did kind of touch my face.
KRAMER Now you listen to me, you've got to find this woman and tell her that you're not a test tube pin cushion.
JERRY It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her.
KRAMER Alright, great, because I got to get down there and pick up my blade. Hey, and I couldn't find that stock room.
ELAINE Oh, that's fantastic.
GEORGE I just talked to Mr. Kruger, he'll be down in a minute. He wanted me to take a photograph for the record.
SARA What record?
GEORGE His personal file, I, I don't ask...
SARA Jerry? What brings you here?
JERRY I don't know, this?
SARA Looks like hives.
JERRY Where do you suppose that could've come from?
GEORGE Jerry, what are you doing...
KRAMER He is just setting the record straight.
JERRY Come on Sitarides, cop to it. What brand of perverted science do you practice?
SARA Are you suggesting I somehow I infected you on purpose?
JERRY I want the antidote, pimple popper!
SARA That's it, I'm out of here! You're insane.
JERRY Am I? You touched my face. I didn't imagine that!
GEORGE Dr. Sitarides don't go! Oh, thanks Jerry!
KRUGER Hey George, hey Doc. We doing the screening here?
GEORGE Aah, yeah, yeah. Won't you head on in, we'll be in in a second. Be right with you.
KRAMER Doc, huh?
GEORGE Kramer, this is perfect. I need you to go in there, pretend you're a doctor and check this guy for moles.
KRAMER Moles, yes. Freckle's ugly cousin.
GEORGE And get a picture of him, with his shirt off.
KRAMER You really are cooking up a little scheme here, aren't you?
GEORGE Alright, lets get in there. Quick, quick, quick...
ELAINE This is it. I can take this anymore. Slow Ride and "dances" few little kicks.
KRAMER Male mammal. Approximately 30 to 60 years of age. Weight...uh indeterminate. Ok, Mr. Kruger, we are gonna take a photo now for the records. So if you'll stand up please and give me a big smile, oh no no no, not that big. Yeah, that's nice, yes okay. Yes, let's have a looksee...ok, so eh, fiber from shirt on the left shoulder. I'm gonna have to keep my on that.
KRUGER How long have you been doing this Dr. Van Nostrand?
KRAMER Uuh, long long time. Yes, I've seen moles so big they have their own moles. Freckles that cover two men.
KRUGER So, how am I looking?
KRAMER Oh, so far, so good... yeuye...
GEORGE Kramer, I really owe you one.
KRAMER George, we got a problem.
GEORGE What?
KRAMER Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious.
GEORGE So, tell him you're concerned about it and he should see someone else.
KRAMER George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send him to another doctor?
GEORGE Because, you're not a dermatologist.
KRAMER He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what I wanna do; I think I can get a section...
GEORGE Whoa, whoa, a section?!
KRAMER Yeah, if I could crab my slicer and he'd hold still...
GEORGE No, you're not taking a deli slicer to my boss...
KRAMER It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it.
GEORGE No! Absolutely Not!
KRAMER Well, it's my medical opinion, that you're making a big mistake. And it's going in my chart. In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
ELAINE Yeah, hello is this Allied Lock Smith?! Oh, finally, listen I need someone to come over here right away!
NEIGHBOR Turn it off! Turn it off!
ELAINE I am getting a lock smith, alright?! Relax!
NEIGHBOR Alright, that's it!
ELAINE Yeah, the address is 78th West...
NEIGHBOR Oh, oh mama...
JERRY So, Kramer pulled it off?
GEORGE Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk, no thanks to you.
JERRY Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks like I had a beard of bees!
GEORGE Why don't you see someone about it?
JERRY I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist in this town? A real dermatologist.
KRAMER Squamous cell carcinoma.
GEORGE You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this.
KRAMER George, that's what he has and I have to give him a call. Now we gotta came clean.
GEORGE You can't tell him the truth, you're gonna blow the whole thing.
KRAMER I don't want this on my conscience.
GEORGE I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this.
KRAMER Yeah, alright...
JERRY Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here.
KRAMER They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts.
JERRY Hey, this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene, a common ingredient in metal cleaners.
KRAMER Well, that's weird.
JERRY What are you doing?
KRAMER Well, I'm cleaning my slicer.
JERRY That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest! That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's from Dr. Van Nostrand!
KRAMER So, somehow the Bronzo is reacting to the poison she's giving you.
JERRY Alright, get out. And take your Bronzo with you
KRAMER Ohh, that's toxic. Ououou....
KRUGER George, come in. I'm just going over our annual report...boy did we take it on the chin last year.
GEORGE Eh, listen Mr. Kruger, I got a message from Dr. Van Nostrand and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole.
KRUGER I'm not too worried about it.
GEORGE Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked out.
KRUGER George, take a look at this photo. This is taken 10 years ago. That mole looks exactly as it does today. So, there's no cause for concern, eh?
GEORGE Whatever.
KRUGER Actually, funny thing about this photo. We were at the beach and there was this dumb looking guy near by. When he went in for a swim, my sons and I took all his stuff and threw it in the ocean! What a pear shaped loser.
GEORGE Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo, until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out of there!
KRUGER Well, I'll be...you have lost a lot of hair.
GEORGE That's what they tell me!
KRAMER Do you want more pastrami?
ELAINE Um, what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good.
KRAMER Yeah, it was olive loaf. You want that?
JERRY I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did.
GEORGE He said he didn't care. Oh, God I love that place. Hey, have you seen other dermatologist?
JERRY Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really bad.
GEORGE What did he give you for it.
JERRY Aloe. So where's that lock smith?
GEORGE Have to give him time on this hour.
ELAINE Can I have a zip?
KRAMER Oh yeah, coming up...
GEORGE I believe the doors on the bathroom stalls, here at the stadium, don't offer much by way of privacy. But I was thinking if we extend the doors all the way to the floors...
MR._STEINBRENNER All the way to the floor! What are you crazy! You'd suffocate in there. Your lucky you have any doors at all. You know when I was in the army... Hey Costanza. What's that your eating over there? It looks pretty tasty.
GEORGE It's a calzone, sir.
MR._STEINBRENNER A calzone huh. Pass it down here. Let's have a look at at it. I want a little taste. Come on, come on. Pass it down here. That's a good boy. Okay. What's in this thing?
GEORGE Uh. Cheese, pepperoni, eggplant.
MR._STEINBRENNER Eggplant. Yes. That's a hell of a thing. Okay let's get back to business. Okay here you go. Very good, very good. Excellent. Excellent calzone you got there Costanza. Okay a little jealous now. Okay let's go. Ok last week.... You know that eggplant was very good. Everybody out. I got eggplant on my mind. Costanza get me couple of those calzones right now. Pronto. Move out. Big Stein wants an eggplant calzone. Must have one. Everybody out. Out.
ELAINE One of those fabric wholesalers. This guy Todd Gack. I won a bet from him.
JERRY What bet?
ELAINE He bet me Dustin Hoffman was in Star Wars.
JERRY Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars!?! Short Jewish guy against Darth Vader. I don't think so.
ELAINE That's what I said.
JERRY So the bet was that the loser has to buy dinner?
ELAINE Yeah.
JERRY Huh.
ELAINE What?
JERRY No, nothing.
JERRY What's with you?
KRAMER Feel this.
JERRY Wow.That's hot.
KRAMER Yeah. It's piquing hot. It's fresh out of the dryer. Hey Elaine you have to feel my pants.
ELAINE I'll see you later.
KRAMER Oh. All right. You don't know what your missing. I'm loving this Jerry. I am never putting on another piece of clothing unless it's straight out of the dryer.
JERRY So know every time you get dressed. You are going to go down to the basement and use the dryer.
KRAMER Oh yeah. It's a warm and wonderful feeling, Jerry. So what are you doing later?
JERRY I got a date with Nikki.
KRAMER Oh yeah she's a beauty.
JERRY She's also quite bold.
KRAMER Oh bold and beautiful.
MR._STEINBRENNER I am loving this calzone. The pita pocket prevents it from dripping. The pita pocket. What is it Watson? A lost and found? No. I don't think we need that. If people keel over because they lost something that's there tough luck. You got a drip on your mouth by the way.
GEORGE You know a lost and found could be a good idea.
MR._STEINBRENNER Hold on Watson. You like lost and found George?
GEORGE Definitely.
MR._STEINBRENNER All right lost and found. But there's got to be a time limit. We're not running a pawn shop here.
JERRY Hey, Elaine.
ELAINE Hi Jerry!
JERRY This is Nikki.
NIKKI Hi!
ELAINE Hello. This is Todd Gack.
JERRY Oh of course. Todd Gack. You did you bet was in Star Wars? Sammy Davis Jr.
ELAINE So what movie are you guys seeing?
NIKKI "Means to an End "
ELAINE Oh. We were going to see that but it was sold out. So were going to see " Blame it on the Rain "
JERRY Why don't you see what you can do?
NIKKI Okay.
ELAINE What's she going to do? There's no more tickets.
JERRY We'll see.
TODD Hey Jerry. Do you like cigars?
JERRY Yeah. Why?
TODD I am going to Montreal tomorrow and they sell them dirt cheap.
JERRY Hey,that might be a nice idea for George's wedding.
TODD So do you want a box?
JERRY Sure. If there cheap Why not.
TODD All right I buy a box and give to Elaine.
NIKKI Okay two tickets "Means to an End"
JERRY Told you.
ELAINE How did you do that?
NIKKI I just talked to the manager.
JERRY All right. Enjoy " Blame it on the Rain "
GEORGE There putting in a lost and found because of me. There's a time limit but still.
JERRY There really building a Utopian society up there huh.And you tribute all this to the calzone.
GEORGE Yeah. I am like a drug dealer. I got the guy hooked. I am having lunch at his desk everyday this week. He doesn't make a move without me. It's very exciting.
JERRY With you two guys at the helm. The last piece of the puzzle is in place.
GEORGE So let me ask you a question about the tip jar. I had a little thing with the calzone guy this week. I go to drop a buck in the tip jar and just as I am about to drop it in he looks the other way. And then when I am leaving he gives me this look think thanks for nothing. I mean if they don't notice it what's the point.
JERRY So you don't make it a habit of giving to the blind.
GEORGE Not bills.
JERRY So George. Remember when I told you Nikki gets whatever she wants. We are at the movies last night. It's sold out. Nikki goes and talks to the manager. Right in.
GEORGE Beautiful women. You know they could get away with murder. You never she any of them lift anything over three pounds. They get whatever they want whenever they want it. You can't stop them.
JERRY She's like a beautiful Godzilla.
GEORGE Without thousands of fleeing Japanese.
KRAMER Hey buddy.
JERRY What the hell is all this?
KRAMER I am looking for quarters for the dryer.
JERRY Why can't you do this on your table?
KRAMER Because I don't have a table.
ELAINE Hey.
JERRY Hey. So how was "Blame it on the Rain?"
ELAINE Huh. Yeah thanks for getting us tickets too.
JERRY Oh!! Let me ask you a question. Was the movie part of the bet?
ELAINE No. We were both in the mood for one.
JERRY You know Elaine, It is not my way to intrude on the personal lives of close fiends..
ELAINE Oh is that so.
JERRY Absolutely. But I feel I must inform you that what happened last night was more than a simple bet.
ELAINE What are you talking about?
JERRY Come on. Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars. He made a bet he knew he was going to lose just to take you to dinner
ELAINE If he wanted to ask me out why didn't he just ask me.
JERRY Because if he doesn't ask you out he doesn't get rejected. He has found a dating loop hole.
ELAINE I don't buy it.
JERRY So what happened after the movie?
ELAINE Nothing. He walked me home.
JERRY To the door?
ELAINE Yeah.
JERRY That's a date.
ELAINE No it's not.
JERRY But I never walk you home.
ELAINE That's just because your a jackass.
KRAMER Ah!! I found a quarter. Anybody want there clothes heated up?
JERRY No, no.
ELAINE No, no.
JERRY So how did you leave it with him?
ELAINE I am supposed to meet him to pick up your cigars.
JERRY That's another loop hole. That's two dates without asking you out.
ELAINE Your crazy!
JERRY Crazy like a man.
WORKER Number 49.
GEORGE You know my last name is Costanza. That's Italian. So you and I are like country men. Pisano's!
WORKER $ 6.50 your change.
GEORGE And I always take care of my Pisano's. So here is a little something.
WORKER Hey! You steal my money!!
GEORGE No no. That's not what I was trying to do.
WORKER I know what you try to do. Get out. Don't ever come back ever.
GEORGE I got your calzones Mr. Steinbrenner.
MR._STEINBRENNER Beautiful. I am starving George.
GEORGE I thought tomorrow maybe we'd try a little corn beef.
MR._STEINBRENNER Corn beef. I don't think so. It is a little fatty.
GEORGE How about Chinese?
MR._STEINBRENNER Uhhhhh. No. Too many containers. Big mess, big mess. Too sloppy.I want to stick with the calzones from Pisano's. That's the ticket.
GEORGE I just thought it would be nice. A little variety.
MR._STEINBRENNER No, no, no. George let me tell you something. When I find something I like I stick with it. From 1973 to 1982 I ate the exact same lunch everyday. Turkey chili in a bowl made out of bread. Bread bowl George . First you eat the chili then you eat the bowl. There's nothing more satisfying than looking down after lunch and seeing nothing but a table.
ELAINE Thanks for the dinner.
TODD Well I had to give these cigars and we were both hungry.
ELAINE Hey Todd. Let me ask you a question. Um. Was this whole date thing just a way of asking me out?
TODD What?
ELAINE I mean Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars?
TODD Elaine that was a legitimate bet and I lost so I bought you dinner.
ELAINE Oh all right. Okay well, goodnight.
TODD Hey, if your not doing anything Saturday do you want to meet somewhere ?
ELAINE See what is that? Is that a date?
TODD Why can't two people go and do something without it being a date?
ELAINE All right. I am sorry it's not a date.
TODD No way. So I'll see you Saturday night?
ELAINE All right.
TODD Pick you up at 8:00 p.m.
POLICE_OFFICER Do you know what the posted speed limit on this road is?
JERRY I was got to be 55.
POLICE_OFFICER That's right it is. Do you know how fast you were going?
JERRY A lot faster than that!
POLICE_OFFICER Step out of the car sir.
JERRY Okay dokey
POLICE_OFFICER Can I have your license and registration please?
JERRY Absolutely. Nikki!
NIKKI Yes.
JERRY Would you mind bringing the officer the registration?
NIKKI Not at all.
POLICE_OFFICER I got you on the radar at 93 miles per hour.
JERRY You must have gotten me when I slowed down to take that curve because for a while there I was doing well over 100.
NIKKI Officer. Hi. Do you really have to give us a ticket?
JERRY All right Nik. That's it.
KRAMER Hey buddy. I am waiting for my shirt.
JERRY You got your shirt in my oven!?!
KRAMER I didn't have any quarters for the dryer. Anyway this is better. And it's more convenient.
JERRY For both of us.
KRAMER And I have a lot more control. I have one shirt going for 10 minutes at 325 degrees.
JERRY What's wrong with your oven?
KRAMER I am baking a pie! Buzz, buzz
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY Come on up.
KRAMER You got cigars, huh.
JERRY I got some Cubans for George's wedding. They were more than I wanted to pay for but what the hell!
KRAMER Oh yeah baby. spit, spit. What are these? " Perducto de Peru " Jerry, if you think these are Cubans you have another thing coming.
JERRY Peru! I paid $300 bucks for these. I could have bought a house in Peru for $300 bucks!
KRAMER You got ripped buddy.
JERRY I got to pay this Todd Gack guy $300 bucks just so he has some excuse to see Elaine again without asking her out.
KRAMER That's a nice name. Todd Gack. Is that Dutch? Oh baby. Here we go. Uh momma. Hey George hey.
GEORGE Well this is bad. I am really in a bad situation now.
JERRY so what is Steinbrenner going to do if he doesn't get his calzones?
GEORGE What's he going to do? That's exactly the point. Nobody knows what this guy is capable of! He fires people like it is a bodily function.
JERRY Why don't you get someone else from the office to go get Pisano's for you?
GEORGE Because before you know it he'll be having lunch with him. You know how these interoffice politics work.
JERRY No. I never had a job. Kramer walks in with no pants on
KRAMER I decided to go with the brown one 's.
GEORGE What the hell is this?
JERRY Kramer's cooking up some corduroy.
GEORGE There has got to be some way to get back into Pisano's.
KRAMER Pisano's. That's the place by the stadium right?
GEORGE Yeah. You've heard of it?
KRAMER Yeah. Newman raves about it. It's on his mail route. He goes by there everyday.
GEORGE I'll see you guys later.
JERRY What kind of pie are you cooking?
KRAMER Huckleberry.
NEWMAN You certainly are in a bind.
GEORGE Yeah. And since you go buy there everyday. I was hoping that we could help each other out.
NEWMAN Oh well. Let me perfectly blunt. I don't care for you Costanza. You hang out at the west side of the building with Seinfeld all day and just it up wasting your lives.
GEORGE Are you going to help me or not?
NEWMAN All right, all right. I'll help you but I will except something in return.
GEORGE What?
NEWMAN Well for starters I want a calzone of my own...
GEORGE All right.
NEWMAN And a slice of pepperoni pizza and a large soda and three times a week I will require a canolie.
GEORGE That's a little steep don't you think?
NEWMAN You know I hear Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic. I would hate to see him when he's hungry.
GEORGE All right, all right.
NEWMAN Do we have a deal?
GEORGE But I have to have them by one o'clock. He's very regiment about his meals.
NEWMAN I know exactly how he feels. Pleasure doing business with you. Do come again. Ha, ha, ha, ha.
ELAINE This is nice.
TODD Gack. Party of four.
ELAINE Party of four? Who are we meeting?
TODD Mom! Dad! This is Elaine.
MOM Hello.
ELAINE Hellllllooooo. End of dinner
MOM Nice meeting you.
TODD Bye mom.
MOM She's wonderful.
ELAINE What the hell was that?
TODD What?
ELAINE Why did you introduce me to your parents?
TODD There nice people. I thought you would like them.
ELAINE Come on Todd. Admit it, this is a date.
TODD Why is this a date?
ELAINE Saturday night with your parents. Unless I'm your sister this is a date.
TODD Elaine. I don't understand why you can't meet someone else's parents without classifying it as a date.
ELAINE Well if it's not a date then what is it?
TODD It's a lovely evening together.
ELAINE I don't believe this.
TODD Well I am getting a cab want to join me?
ELAINE No. I'll just walk home.
TODD Okay goodnight.
ELAINE Now what was that?
NEWMAN Hello. What 's this?
GEORGE Well I was dropping of the calzone money for the week.. Um shouldn't you be at work by now?
NEWMAN Work? It's raining.
GEORGE Soooooo
NEWMAN I called in sick. I don't work in the rain.
GEORGE You don't work in the rain? Your a mailman. " Neither rain nor sleet nor snow..." It's the first one.
NEWMAN I was never that big on creeds.
GEORGE You were supposed to deliver my calzones. We had a deal!
NEWMAN I believe the deal was that I get the calzones on my mail route. Well today I won't be going on my mail route! Will I. Perhaps tomorrow.
GEORGE But I'm paying you!
NEWMAN Yes thank you.
GEORGE Newman!!
NIKKI Peru? I thought you wanted cigars from Cuba?
JERRY I did.
NIKKI Well if these aren't what you wanted then why did you pay him?
JERRY Well what could I do? Unless you pay him a visit.
NIKKI Okay.
GEORGE Kramer!
KRAMER Hey you!
GEORGE Look I need you to do me a favor. I need you to get me lunch at Pisano's.
KRAMER What happened to Newman?
GEORGE He called in sick.
KRAMER Oh yeah right it's raining.
GEORGE Can you do it?
KRAMER What time do you need it at?
GEORGE 1:00 p.m. Do you need any money?
KRAMER No. I got eight tons of change. I'm loaded.
KRAMER Hey hold that bus! Kramer at Pisano's
KRAMER Hey. It's really wet out there.
WORKER What can I get you?
KRAMER I here you make a pretty mean calzone.
WORKER Calzone!
KRAMER Yeah calzone.
WORKER The best!
KRAMER All right. Lay them on me. I'll take three.
WORKER Three calzones.
KRAMER Hey. That's a big oven. Huh. Listen. I was wondering if you could do me a favor.
ELAINE Hey Todd.
TODD Hi. You know Nikki.
ELAINE Yeah sure.
NIKKI Wait. Elaine will settle this. What's the "M" stand for in Richard M. Nixon?
ELAINE Milhouse.
NIKKI I told you so. He said it was Moe. You owe me a dinner.
WORKER Your order is ready. Three calzones and one shirt and jacket.
KRAMER Oh. This is all burned up. Look at this.
WORKER What the hell do I know about cooking a shirt? What the hell is this? Your paying in pennies?
KRAMER That's all I got.
WORKER No. You have to have bills. Paper money. You can't pay with this.
KRAMER I told you this is all I got.
WORKER Then no calzones. Worker and Kramer yelling at each other back and forth in Italian
GEORGE What happened? Where have you been?
KRAMER The guy wouldn't give them to me because I wanted to pay in change.
GEORGE What the hell happened to your shirt?
KRAMER He overcooked it. It's ruined.
GEORGE Your clothes smell just like Pisano's. There's another Italian place on Jerome. Maybe I can fool him.
MR._STEINBRENNER say it again. I hadn't had a pimple since I was eighteen and I don't care that you don't believe me or not. And how's this. Your fired. Okay your not He's late. That smell. I have to call you back. Costanza. He's in the building. Costanza is in the building and he's not in this office. Costanza! I'll get you.
JERRY Stupid cigars. You know if I didn't send Nikki over to talk to him they wouldn't be together.
ELAINE These are terrible.
JERRY It's like trying to smoke a chicken bone.
ELAINE What kind of a name is Todd Gack anyway.
JERRY I think it's Dutch. I got to get going.
ELAINE Where are you going?
JERRY I.. uh..promised Nikki that I'd walk her dog for her.
ELAINE But she broke up with you.
JERRY I know, I know. But some how she explained it to me and I couldn't say no.
ELAINE It smells like a rubber fire.
JERRY What's that?
ELAINE I said rubber fire.
JERRY Oh.
ELAINE Did you ever pay Todd for these things?
JERRY Actually it's being taken care of right now.
KRAMER You Gack?
TODD Yeah.
KRAMER Here's your money.
MR._STEINBRENNER George. Why do these clothes smell like Pisano's?
GEORGE Because they were heated up there.
MR._STEINBRENNER Heating up your clothes? That's not a bad idea.
JERRY I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, and I don't know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because it's really not a definite thing yet. Well, I will tell you what I know so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that I've received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes. Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. It's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didn't even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, that's what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, "You may have already won." I'd like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. Send out envelopes, "You have definitely lost!" You turn it over, giant printing, "Not even close!" You open it up, there's this whole letter of explanation, "Even we cannot believe how badly you've done in this contest."
JERRY To the right.
GEORGE That took awhile.
JERRY Don't get up.
GEORGE I'd like to help, but my neck..
GEORGE So how long has it been in the basement?
JERRY Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida, but they didn't want it. They told me to get rid of it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And it's been sitting down there for three years.. until he saw it. Alright, so, just take what you want and let's get it out of here.
GEORGE What's in it?
JERRY Grandpa clothes. I can't wear them.
KRAMER You want these? Knee socks. You don't wear knee socks.
JERRY No, go ahead. Look at this place. I can't wait to get it cleaned.
GEORGE I know someone who'll do it. She's good. She's honest.
JERRY No, Elaine got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend goes to Columbia grad school, and he's suppose to do it.
GEORGE Students can't clean. It's anathema. ..They don't like it.
JERRY How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?
KRAMER Now this, I like.
GEORGE Wait a second. I can't believe this! Let me see this.
KRAMER Wait, wait, wait..
GEORGE Let me just see it.
KRAMER Come on..
GEORGE Let me just see it for a second. Oh my God, it's exactly the same!
JERRY What?
GEORGE When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, "MacArthur Park", and I got to the part about, "I'll never have that recipe again," and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father naked.
KRAMER C'mon, George. I saw it first.
GEORGE No, Kramer. I have to have this statue.
KRAMER No, I got dibs!
GEORGE What? No dibs! I need this statue. C'mon, give it!
JERRY Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why don't you just settle it like mature adults?
KRAMER Potato man!
GEORGE No, no, no potato man.. Inka-dink.
KRAMER Okay.. start with me.
GEORGE Yeah, good, good.
JERRY Inka-dink, a bottle of ink. The cork fell out, and you stink. Not because you're dirty, not because you're clean - just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine.. And you are it!
KRAMER What?! Wait a minute. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, oh, oh, okay. He's out. I get it.
GEORGE No, no, no, no.. I'm "it". I win.
JERRY No, he's it. He wins. "It" is good.
KRAMER Do over - start with him.
JERRY No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks.
KRAMER Alright, you can have it. Okay, I'm gonna take the suit, and the shoes, and the hat.
JERRY Alright, c'mon. Let's go.
KRAMER Hey, I'll look like Joe Friday in Dragnet.
GEORGE I can't believe I won at Inka-dink.
JERRY Come on, let's go. Aren't you gonna take it?
GEORGE No, no, no, I don't want to carry it around all night. I'll pick it up later.
GEORGE What about your stuff?
KRAMER Oh, uh, well - okay.
JERRY Alright, let's go. Hey, you know, you owe me one.
GEORGE What?
JERRY The Inka-dink.. you were "It".
GEORGE "It"'s bad?
JERRY "It" very bad.
RAVA Well, if they don't let you be my editor on this book, I'll go to another publisher. It's that simple.
ELAINE You told them that?
RAVA Of course.
ELAINE This is so fantastic. I don't know how to thank you.
JERRY So, where's this boyfriend of yours? I can't wait much longer. I've got a flight.
ELAINE Oh, probably caught in traffic.
RAVA Or maybe he's dead.
JERRY So what do you write, children's books?
RAVA That's Ray.
RAY Ah, greetings, greetings, and salutations. I beg your forgiveness. My tardiness was unavoidable. Rava, my love. Elaine, my dear friend.. And you must be Jerry. Lord of the manor. Ah, my liege. A pleasure to serve you.
JERRY ..Alright.
RAVA And we have to get back to work.
JERRY I gotta get to the airport.
RAY Your place shall sparkle like the stars in heaven upon your save arrival, Sire.
JERRY The toilet brush is under the sink..
JERRY I don't really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because there's that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, you're sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, "I'm really sorry about this. I don't know why I let that stuff over there." And that's why I could never be a maid, because I'd have an attitude. I'd find them, whereever they are in the house, "Oh, I suppose you couldn't do this? No, don't get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you couldn't dust. No, this is too tough, isn't it?"
JERRY He really did an amazing job, look! He uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid. He cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups. Come here, look at this. He cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. How did he get in there? He must be like Rubber Man!
ELAINE There's no Rubber Man.
JERRY ..Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? There's Elastic Man and Plastic Man.
ELAINE I'm leaving.
JERRY Where are you going?
ELAINE To Rava's house. I've gotta pick up her manuscript.
JERRY Wait. I'll go with you. Elaine, he Windexed the little peep hole!
ELAINE So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. He's the editor-in-chief! I think because of your request..
RAVA Demand. There's Ray.. late as usual.
RAY Well, this is an unexpected surprise - and Delight! The once and future king of comedy, "Jerry the First," gracing our humble abode. Rava, we're in the presence of royalty.
JERRY Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment.
RAY But I didn't just clean your apartment. It was a ritual, a ceremony, a celebration of life.
JERRY Shouldn't you be out on a ledge somewhere?
RAVA The water is boiling. Are you having tea?
ELAINE_AND_RAY Yes.
ELAINE Jerry? ..Jerry!
JERRY What?
RAVA Ray, would you give me a hand?
RAY Yeah, I'm coming!
JERRY I think that's the statue from my house. That looks like the statue from my house!
ELAINE What statue?
JERRY I had a statue!
ELAINE You have a statue? I never saw a statue.
JERRY My grandfather gave me a statue!
ELAINE Since when?
JERRY What's the difference?! That's the one! He ripped me off! This guy ripped me off!
RAY Do you take sugar?
JERRY_AND_ELAINE Uhh.. no.
JERRY I can't believe it! This guy ripped me off!
ELAINE Do you realize what you're saying?
JERRY Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of my house!
RAY Lemon?
JERRY_AND_ELAINE Uh.. sure, yeah..
ELAINE Are you sure?
JERRY Pretty sure! Ninety-nine percent sure.
ELAINE Ninety-nine percent sure?!
RAY Ah, sweet elixir. It's fragrant nectar - a soothing balm for the soul.
RAY The pastries!
ELAINE Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe it's just a coincidence.
JERRY Coincidence? This guy's in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, he has the same exact statue in his apartment.
ELAINE I never saw the statue.
JERRY I had a statue! What should I do?
ELAINE I don't know.
JERRY ..I'll call Kramer. He can check my house.
ELAINE Oh Jerry, don't blow this for me.
JERRY Don't worry.. Kramer! Kramer!.. It's Jerry!.. Jerry! .. from next door!.. Never mind where I am!.. Yes, Jerry Seinfeld!..
JERRY Ma, I told ya, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right in the pan. Okay, bye. My mother.. She forgot how to make French Toast. You know how mothers are.
RAVA My mother left us when I was six years old. All seven of us. He ever heard from her again. I hope she's rotting in an alley somewhere.
JERRY My mom's down in Florida.. she's go one of those condos.. Hot down there in the summer. You ever been down there?
RAY I love these pastries. You know, in Scandinavian mythology, the pastries were the food of the gods.
JERRY ..Listen, I just remembered.. I'm ..uh, getting a facial.
ELAINE Oh, see you tomarrow morning.
RAY Oh, how about dinner?
JERRY No, I don't eat dinner. Dinner's for suckers.
JERRY Uh huh.. yeah.. Okay, thanks anyway. Bye. Nope, the cop says it's my word against his. There's nothing they can do.
KRAMER Let's go get him.
JERRY Yeah, right.
GEORGE We can't just let him get away with this.
JERRY Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this? He knew I was gonna know it's missing, and he took it! And of all things to take - I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo. He's crazy.
KRAMER You wanta go get him?
ELAINE Well, then, if he's crazy you should just forget it.
GEORGE Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect the surprise of a lifetime. My mother's making her roasted potatoes!
ELAINE George, do you realize that Rava's asked me to edit her book?
GEORGE Who is this Rava?
KRAMER I say we get him.
ELAINE No!
GEORGE Let me just call him.
JERRY I'll call him. Hello, Ray? ..Hi, Ray, this is Rava's friend, Elaine's frined, Jerry.. The King of Comedy.. right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one with the blue lady? Will you shut up?! Yeah, you don't want to talk about it over the phone? You don't want Rava to hear? ..Yeah, I understand.. You know that coffee shop near my house, Monk's? ..Alright, tomarrow. One o' clock. Great, okay, bye.
ELAINE Alright, look, look, look, Let's say he stole it.
GEORGE Oh, he stole it?
ELAINE C'mon, you can't do anything about it. The cops won't do anything. What, are you going to fight him? Why don't you just.. forget it?
JERRY_AND_GEORGE No.
GEORGE I thought you said one o' clock.
JERRY Relax, he's late. He's always late. It's part of his "M.O."
GEORGE Remember, don't take any crap.
JERRY Yeah, yeah.. don't worry about it.
GEORGE I'll be right here.
JERRY That's comforting.. Shh. He's here. Ray?
RAY Oh, Jerry. I can't believe you asked me about that statue. Do you know how much trouble you could've got me into?
JERRY ..Well, I didn't..
RAY Rava was standing right next to me. I never told her where I got the statue.
GEORGE I wonder why.
JERRY Well, just give it back, and I won't say anything.
RAY Give it back?
JERRY Yeah.
RAY What are you talking about?
JERRY What are you talking about?
GEORGE What is he talking about..
RAY I'm talking about the statue.
JERRY Yeah, me too.
RAY Give it back to whom?
JERRY Me.
GEORGE Yeah, him.
RAY You?
JERRY Yeah. Me.
RAY I'm not getting this.
GEORGE You already got it.
JERRY Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house - and then I saw it in your house.
RAY What are you saying?
JERRY What am I saying?
GEORGE Take a wild guess.
RAY Are you saying I stole your statue?
GEORGE What a mind.
JERRY Well, I..
RAY I can't believe what I'm hearing.
JERRY I can't believe what I'm hearing.
GEORGE I can't believe what I'm hearing.
RAY For your information, I got that statue at a pawn shop.
GEORGE A pawn shop?
JERRY A pawn shop?
RAY Yes. In Chinatown with the money I earned cleaning people's apartments.
GEORGE And cleaning them out.
JERRY Oh, excuse me.. Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house.
RAY What's behind this? It's Rava, isn't it?
GEORGE Again with the Rava.
RAY You want her.
JERRY No, she's a little too cheery for me.
RAY She's from Finland, for crying out loud. Finland! Do you understand?!
JERRY I know Finland. They're neutral.
RAY Is it me? Do I rub you the wrong way?
JERRY No, I actually find you quite charming.. a bit verbose at times.
GEORGE "Oh, I find you so charming" ..You wuss.
JERRY Did you call me a wuss?
RAY What did you say?
JERRY I said luss.. I'm at a luss..
RAY I would just love to take you down to the shop where I got it.
JERRY That's not necessary. You know, maybe it's not that bad an idea.
RAY And I would love to. Nothing would please me more. But, unfortunately, the guy retired and moved to Singapore.
GEORGE Singapore?! Do you hear this?
RAY If you really want, maybe I can contact the guy in Singapore aand have him make a photostat of the receipt and send it over.
GEORGE That's it! That's it! I can't take it. I can't take it anymore! You stole the statue! You're a theif! You're a liar!
JERRY George.
RAY Who is this?
GEORGE I'm the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is.. guilty!
RAY What's going on here?
GEORGE Guilty!
RAY Your friend is crazy.
GEORGE Oh, I'm crazy!
JERRY George, george..
RAY I've got to get going. I have a class.
GEORGE Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal. I called the registrar's office. I checked you out. They have no record of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar!
RAY Well, that's because I'm registered under my full legal name, Raymond Thomas Wochinski. Ray Thomas is my professional name.
GEORGE You mean alias.
RAY You are starting to make me angry.
GEORGE Well, that was bound to happen!
RAY I hope you think about what you've done here today.. and if you want to call and apologize, you know where to reach me.
JERRY Hey, Ray.
RAY Yes?
JERRY How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? It was like a brand-new nozzle!
ELAINE Nervous?
RAVA Why should I be?
ELAINE Yeah. Right.
RAVA Your notes are very insightful.
ELAINE The book is great. Did you go out last night?
RAVA No. We made love on the floor like two animals. Ray is insatiable.
ELAINE They all are..
RAVA Was Jerry?
ELAINE I can't remember..
RAVA You know, Ray is very upset over these accusations.
ELAINE Oh, well, I'm staying out of this one. This is between them. I am not getting involved.
RAVA So you think he stole it?!
ELAINE Well, you have to admit.. the circumstantial evidence.
RAVA I admit nothing!
MAN Will you put that cigarette out, please?
ELAINE Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then it's gon and it's in your apartment.
RAVA Maybe you think we're in cahoots.
ELAINE No, no.. but it is quite a coincidence.
RAVA Yes, that's all, a coincidence!
ELAINE A big coincidence.
RAVA Not a big coincidence. A coincidence!
ELAINE No, that's a big coincidence.
RAVA That's what a coincidence is! There are no small coincidences and big coincidences!
ELAINE No, there are degrees of coincidences.
RAVA No, there are only coincidences! ..Ask anyone! Are there big coincidences and small coincidences, or just coincidences? ..Well?! Well?!..
MAN Will you put that cigarette out?!
RAVA Maybe I put it out on your face! It's just like Ray said - you and Jerry are jealous of our love. You're trying to destroy us.
ELAINE Shouldn't you be out on a ledge somewhere?
GEORGE Ma, will you stop?.. It's just a statue! How is it my fault?! ..It was stolen. I didn't even touch it this time.. Okay, fine. I don't se why this should affect to potatoes! Okay. Goodbye. She doesn't react to disappointement very well.. unlike me.
KRAMER I'm not happy about this.
ELAINE Why don't we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?
GEORGE There's just no justice. This experience has changed me. It's made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded.
JERRY Really?
GEORGE Sure. Why not?
ELAINE Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook.
JERRY Can't you talk to your boss?
ELAINE I did. He loves Rava.. worse.. he loves Ray, and he doesn't think you're funny at all.
KRAMER I'm not happy about this.
JERRY Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice..
GEORGE Yeah.. He'll have my parents!
KRAMER Police! Open up!
RAY Police?
KRAMER Freeze, mother!
RAY Hey..
KRAMER Shut up. Spread 'em. I said spread 'em! You're in big trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods.. and uh, uh.. murder.
RAY Murder?!
KRAMER Shut up! Keep 'em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!
RAY I think you have me confused with somebody else.
KRAMER Is your name Ray?
RAY Yeah.
KRAMER Yeah, you're the punk I'm looking for.
RAY Hey, hey, are you a cop?
KRAMER Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm a good cop. I'm a damn good cop! Today's your lucky day, junior, 'cause I'm gonna let you off with a warning. Any more of this criminal activity, and you'll be sorry. You got me?
RAY Got you? I don't even know what the hell you're talking about.
KRAMER Good. Good. Let's keep it that way.
JERRY Alright, alright. What's the big hubbub, bub?
GEORGE Kramer, I can't believe it. Oh, you're my hero!
KRAMER Yeah.
JERRY Kramer, what did you do?
KRAMER Well, let's put it this way: I didn't take him to People's Court.
GEORGE I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. I.. I.. I feel happy! Kramer, I don't know how to thank you!
KRAMER Well, I'll think of something..
JERRY People are going to steal from you. You can't stop them. But, everybody has their own little personal security things - things that they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? ..You go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker. Who's gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? I tied a bow. They can't get through that. I put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move on.
JERRY I have a friend who is about to get married, they're having the bachelor party and the bridal shower on the same day... So it's conceivable that while she's getting the lingerie, he'd be at a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit. That is possible. But to me, the difference between being single and being married, is the form of government. You see, when you're single, you are the dictator of your own life. I have complete power. I can give the order to fall asleep on the sofa with the TV on in the middle of the day, no-one can overrule me! When you're married, you're part of a vast decision-making body. Before anything gets done there are meetings. Committees have to study the situation. And this is if the marriage works. That's what's so painful about divorce you get impeached and you're not even the president!
GEORGE Hey, is it my imagination, or do really good looking women walk a lot faster than everybody else?
ELAINE We don't walk that fast...
GEORGE No seriously...
ELAINE Seriously, we don't.
GEORGE The better looking they are, the faster they go! I mean, I see they out there on the street, they're zooming around, like a blur. Like they have a motor on their ass.
ELAINE Hey Jerry, come on, let's go. We're gonna miss the previews!
JERRY What's the big hurry?
ELAINE Hey, how are we gettin' to Scott Drake's party on Saturday night?
JERRY Oh, Drake's party, I forgot to buy a present.
GEORGE I gotta buy a present now?
ELAINE Of course you do, it's an engagement party.
GEORGE It never ends, this present stuff! Engagement present! Then they get married, you gonna have to get them something for that! Then the baby, there's another present. Then the baby starts getting their presents. I don't even like Drake.
JERRY You don't like the Drake?
GEORGE Hate the Drake.
ELAINE I love the Drake.
JERRY How could you not like the Drake?
GEORGE Who's the Drake?
ELAINE "Who's the Drake"?
JERRY The Drake is good!
ELAINE So listen, what are you gonna get him?
GEORGE I haven't even met the fiancee! Whatever!
JERRY Elaine, look. I drew this triangle free-hand. It's a doodle. It's perfect!
ELAINE So what? That's easy.
JERRY Easy?
ELAINE Hi! Hey, have you gotten your present yet for the Drake?
KRAMER Uh, no, no, not yet.
JERRY Do you like the Drake?
KRAMER I love the Drake! I'm looking forward to meeting the Drakette!
ELAINE I'm lukewarm about the Drakette.
KRAMER That's a nice triangle...
JERRY It's Isosceles
KRAMER Ooh, Isosceles. I love the name Isosceles. If I had a kid, I would name him Isosceles. Isosceles Kramer.
ELAINE Hey, you know what, maybe we should all chip in for the gift.
JERRY The chip-in!
ELAINE Hey, a pretty good idea, huh?
JERRY Yeah!
KRAMER Yeah, the chip-in, defenitely!
JERRY You know what, let's go to that mall in Liberal before we go to the party. We'll have to take your car, it's got the most room.
KRAMER No, no! My car's not running.
JERRY What about your father's car?
GEORGE No, no, no. Out of the question. I was over there today. He's got the good spot in front of the good building in the good neighbourhood. I know he's not gonna wanna move.
JERRY Are you serious?
GEORGE You don't know what that spot means to him. Once he gets it, he doesn't go out for weeks.
JERRY How about this, you put your car in the good spot, that'll hold the good spot in front of the good building, and we can get the good car!
GEORGE Good thinking!
JERRY Good to meet you!
ELAINE So what are we gonna get him?
JERRY We could get him anything we wanted, we're chippin' in.
GEORGE I like this area. I could live out here.
KRAMER Yeah, we ought to all get a house and live together.
JERRY Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll tell you what chuckles, I give you permission to sublet my room right now.
GEORGE Look at this. There's no spaces here. Excuse me, are you gettin' out?
MAN_IN_CAR No!
KRAMER Why don't you take a handicap spot...
GEORGE You think?
ELAINE No, no! We'll find a space. There's spaces in the other lot.
GEORGE I don't want to walk that far.
ELAINE What if a handicapped person needs it?
KRAMER Oh, come on, they don't drive!
JERRY Yes, they do!
KRAMER Have you ever seen a handicapped person pull into a space and park?
JERRY Well there's spaces there, they must drive!
KRAMER Well they don't. If they could drive, they wouldn't be handicapped.
ELAINE So if you can drive, you're not handicapped?
GEORGE Look, we're not gonna be that long anyway... we have to get to the "party"!
KRAMER I got news for you: handicapped people, they don't even want to park there! They wanna be treated just like anybody else! That's why, those spaces are always empty.
GEORGE He's right! It's the same thing with the femenists. You know, they want everything to be equal, everything! But when the check comes, where are they?
ELAINE What does that mean?
GEORGE Yeah! Alright, I'm pulling in.
KRAMER Yeah, go ahead.
ELAINE George!
GEORGE Oh, come on, it's five minutes.
KRAMER Make sure we don't forget where the car's parked.
JERRY Do you believe the deal we got on this? A big screen TV? At that price?
ELAINE What a sale, huh? And how about that store, delivering it tonight? We're gonna be swimming in 'thank you's...
GEORGE What did I get the veggie burger for? You got a veggie burger, so I had to get the veggie burger, I'm allover crums...
JERRY No-one's gonna have a better gift than this big screen TV! Good for them, love the Drake!
ELAINE Got to love the Drake!
JERRY Hey, what's going on over here?
ELAINE Must have been an accident...
JERRY Hey, what's going on?
WOMAN Some jerk parked in a handicap spot, so this woman in a wheelchair had to wheel up this incline, and half way up her batteries gave up, and she rolled backwards into the wall. Taken her to St. Elizabeth's...
JERRY Is she ok?
WOMAN I don't know. We're just waiting here for the owner of this car to show up. May not get out alive! Thug! Taking up a handicap spot? He's gonna pay!
JERRY Son's of bitches! Good luck finding them... him... whatever. I'd like to stick around and get my hands on him myself, but I gotta take off.
GEORGE How are we gonna get out of here? They'll kill us!
ELAINE Are you happy now?
KRAMER Who would think these people we're gonna be here?
JERRY I don't know...
ELAINE What about the party? What about the Drake?
GEORGE Screw the Drake!
JERRY I love the Drake!
KRAMER Let's just take a bus back to the city.
GEORGE Can't leave the car here!
KRAMER Why not?
GEORGE It's my father's car!
EVERYBODY Yeah! Yeah!
JERRY Let's get out of here.
GEORGE What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out of here?
JERRY The thing is, even if we go back by the car, and there's nobody there, how do we know they're not all hiding, waiting for us?
ELAINE Well, they have to give up some time, they can't stay out there all night?
JERRY What are we, John Dillinger? How did this get to be the crime of the century? It's not like we stuck a broomstick in her spokes and she went flying...
GEORGE What I don't get is, just because the battery is dead, you think she'd be able to roll up the hill with her hands!
KRAMER You'd think...
GEORGE I mean, batteries have gone dead before, aren't they prepared for that?
KRAMER Most of them don't even have batteries.
GEORGE Must be one of those rich, spoiled handicapped people, who didn't want to do any work, and just wanted to sit in her wheelchair and take it easy.
KRAMER Yeah...
GEORGE Well, I'm sorry!
ELAINE Our big screen TV is probably arriving right now...
GEORGE How are we gonna get out of here? We need a plan!
JERRY I got it! We give the keys to Elaine.
ELAINE Me?
JERRY Yeah! You're a woman! Men don't hit a woman!
ELAINE Oh, they won't?
JERRY Not if they don't know you...
ELAINE I'm not going for this, Kramer should go! It was all his idea!
KRAMER No chance in hell!
JERRY What if we created some sort of diversion? What if we all went by the car and started
SCREAMING "There he is, there's the guy that took the handicap spot!" And then, when they all run into the other direction, we'll jump in the car!
GEORGE That's good, we'll give it a try...
ELAINE That's good...
JERRY That doesn't work, we'll give 'em Kramer!
KRAMER Huh?
JERRY You know, a lot of these scratches will buff right out...
FRANK Eight years have I had this car. Not a scratch on it! Eight years!
FRANK A beautiful Mercury! I special-ordered that bench seat!
GEORGE Dad, that other car cut us off! They had swastikas all over it... They were hurling racial epiphates at us... I could have been killed!
ESTELLE I told you not to give it to him!
FRANK You know, my insurance doesn't cover this? The whole thing is a total loss!
MAHJONGH_LADY Frank, the important thing is, he didn't get hurt!
FRANK No it isn't!
MAHJONGH_LADY So what are you doing now, Georgie?
GEORGE I'm uh... writing a pilot for nbc...
FRANK Where the hell is my paper?
MAHJONGH_LADY You're writing a pilot?
ESTELLE With his friend, Jerry Seinfeld... the comedian...
MAHJONGH_LADY So what's it about?
GEORGE Well, Jerry's car gets hit and the other driver doesn't have any insurance, so the judge sentences him to be Jerry's butler.
MAJONGH_LADIES This is the same situation! Frank, maybe you ought to make him your butler!
ESTELLE Every time you're with that Kramer, something happens... He's a real trouble maker!
GEORGE Nah, he didn't have anything to do with it...
ESTELLE He's all together crazy, that one! Jerry? I used to think was nice... I don't know what happened to him...
JERRY So it was a good party, huh? Oh... you're welcome, you're welcome... They loved the TV, loved it!
ELAINE Oh, yeah...
JERRY Oh, wait a second, I'll ask her.. that's a great idea. Drake wants to know if we want to come out to Minneolis this afternoon, since we missed the partly last night, to maybe get something to eat?
ELAINE Sure!
JERRY Sure! ... Okay... Don't worry, I'm taking my car! ... okay... okay, see you later... bye...
JERRY The Drake is great!
ELAINE Hmm.. he's so nice! I'm really happy for them.
JERRY Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm happy for them, I mean I'm glad they're happy, but, frankly, that doesn't do anything for me.
JERRY Yes?
GEORGE It's me.
JERRY Come on up.
KRAMER Hey. I just came from St. Elizabeth's.
JERRY St. Elizabeth's Hospital? Why?
KRAMER Well, the handicapped woman? I went to see her.
ELAINE You went to see her?
KRAMER Yeah.
JERRY Wow, what happened?
KRAMER I'm in love.
JERRY What?
KRAMER Yeah, she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I love her Jerry, I really love her. I'm gonna ask her to marry me. She's got everything I've always wanted in another human being. Except for the walking.
JERRY Oh, what's the difference, you don't go out that much.
KRAMER Ah, I'm glad you're here.
GEORGE What?
KRAMER Alright, now, we gotta go out. We gotta buy a wheelchair.
GEORGE A wheelchair? What for?
KRAMER Well, you know I went to the hospital today, and I saw the woman, you know, and the wheelchair is totalled, we gotta get her another one!
GEORGE Doesn't she have collision?
KRAMER George, I'm in love with her!
GEORGE Well, my father works for the United Volunteers, maybe he can get her one.
KRAMER No! She needs it now!
GEORGE What about these two? Aren't they gonna chip in?
KRAMER Well...
ELAINE Hey, we told you not to park there!
GEORGE Can't we just fix the old one?
KRAMER Alright, alright. Fine George! Don't chip in! But some day, we're gonna be driving along, we're gonna look out the window, and see her crawling along 5th avenue! Is that what you want?
GEORGE Alright, alright! We'll buy her a wheelchair! Wheelchairs, engagement presents.. it never ends!
SALESMAN This is out best model. The Cougar 9000. It's the Rolls Royce of wheelchairs. This is like... you're almost glad to be handicapped.
KRAMER So now, what's this got?
SALESMAN Inductive joystick, dynamic braking, flip-up arms, it's fully loaded. I put Stephen Hawking in one of these two months ago, he's lovin' it! It's rated number one by Hospital Supply and Prosthetic Magazine.
GEORGE How much?
SALESMAN 6200.
GEORGE Do you have something a little more... less expensive?
JERRY_AND_ELAINE Hey Drake! Hi Drake!
JERRY Hey Alison! Hey, there's the TV, Elaine, look at that!
ELAINE My God this is fantastic! Tell me, were you guys just blown away or what?
THE_DRAKE Oh yeah, yeah... it's fantastic...
JERRY I am gonna make good use of this! I'm watching every superbowl here, every big fight....
ELAINE Oh man, there is nothing like a really big TV, huh?
JERRY So where're we eatin'?
THE_DRAKE Well, actually... Jerry...
ELAINE I'm really hungry!
THE_DRAKE ... we just broke up...
JERRY When did this happen?
THE_DRAKE About 20 minutes ago... Hey, I am really sorry about this guys... whew!
JERRY Look at the picture on this thing...
ELAINE Oh, cristal clear!
JERRY They know how to make 'em...
ELAINE Are there any good Italian restaurants around here?
THE_DRAKE Gagliano's... that's pretty good...
JERRY Well... we should...
ELAINE Get movin'...
JERRY Yeah... Hey, Drake, what ever happens, I am sure it'll be for the best.
ELAINE Take it easy. Bye-Bye Alison!
ELAINE Oh, the remote! Okay, I'm just gonna put it on top of the television...
SALESMAN Alright, this one is about 8 years old. Not a scratch on it, it was owned by some lady who only used it to go from the bathroom to the kitchen and to feed her cat.
KRAMER But this'll get you around?
SALESMAN Oh sure, it just doesn't have any of the thrills of the Cougar.
GEORGE Like what?
SALESMAN For example, your tremor-damping.
KRAMER Now what's that?
SALESMAN It helps to control the direction regardless of the operator's tremors or spasticity.
KRAMER Well, is it alright if I try it?
SALESMAN Hop in!
KRAMER Oh yeah!
SALESMAN I tell ya...
SALESMAN When I see someone enjoying themselves like that, it reminds me why I got into this business in the first place.
GEORGE How much?
SALESMAN How about $240? GEORGE &
KRAMER We'll take it!
ELAINE Drake gave her the TV?
JERRY He gave her all the gifts; he felt guilty.
ELAINE Well, she can't keep it, it's not fair, that's our TV!
JERRY I know it is!
ELAINE Boy, I am really starting to dislike the Drake!
JERRY I hate the Drake! Maybe the whole thing was a scam. Anybody can just get engaged and get presents and just keep them all. Maybe they're on their way to Chicago tomorrow and do the whole thing all over again.
ELAINE They don't know anybody in Chicago.
JERRY Don't worry, they'll make friends fast with that nice TV.
GEORGE Hey.
JERRY Hey, guess what? The Drake broke up.
GEORGE The Drake broke up?! That's fantastic! Now we get the TV back! It'll help defray some of the cost of the wheelchair.
JERRY I don't know about defraying.
GEORGE Why?
JERRY We're not gettin' that TV.
GEORGE What do you mean? The engagement is off, we get the TV back. That's business.
ELAINE The Drakette took it.
GEORGE She can't take it. It's not hers, it's theirs. Once there's no theirs there's no hers, it should be ours.
ELAINE Well, she has it!
GEORGE I told you the Drake was bad! I hate the Drake!
GEORGE Maybe we should call her.
ELAINE Well, who's gonna call?
JERRY You are.
ELAINE What? Why is it me who always has to do these things?
JERRY Because that's your thing!
ELAINE What? Calling people I hardly know, and demanding they return expensive gifts, that's my "thing"?
JERRY Yeah, that's your thing.
ELAINE Alright, gimme the phone... it's my "thing"...
JERRY You know, I'm thinking about getting a yo-yo.
GEORGE Really?
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE I could see that... Hello?
ELAINE Alison! Hi, this is Elaine... I gave all the gifts to charity.
ELAINE Oh, Okay... well thanks a lot... sorry again about you and the Drake... I hate the Drake.
ELAINE Everybody does. Bye-bye....
ELAINE She gave it to charity.
JERRY Charity?!? That's apalling.
GEORGE How could anybody be so selfish and inconsiderate!
KRAMER Well, I gave her the wheelchair! You should have seen the look on her face. And then she told me, that the old wheelchair, that wasn't any good anyway! So you see George, the whole incident was a God blessing! Yeah!
GEORGE You mean a blessing in disguise?
KRAMER Yeah....
LADY And I would also like to personally thank our gracious host Frank Costanza, who has earned the silver circle award and is our unanimous choice for the United Volunteer Representative of the Month!
LADY Due to his tireless effort, he personally raised over $22,000. That's a lot of wheelchairs!
LADY On behalf of the United Volunteers of Greater New York, we thank you!
FRANK Well... thank you very much!
COP Mr. Costanza?
FRANK Yes?
COP You're under arrest.
FRANK Under arrest? What for?
COP Reckless endangerment of public safety, and violation of traffic code 342-A.
FRANK What's that?
COP Parking in a handicap spot. Let's go...
FRANK George! George!
JERRY Your father got arrested? For what?
GEORGE Parking in a handicap spot. Right in the middle of his United Volunteers meeting. When he got back, he chased after me with a baseball bat.
JERRY Ho-ly!
GEORGE Between the car getting totalled, the towing charge and the fine, there's no way I can ever pay him back...
JERRY So what are you gonna do?
GEORGE I agreed to become his butler.
JERRY What?
JERRY What's the matter?
KRAMER It's over!
JERRY What's over?
KRAMER Me and Lola....
GEORGE The woman we bought the wheelchair for?
KRAMER Yeah, she dumped me!
JERRY She dumped you?
KRAMER She dumped me! She rolled right over me! Said I was a hipster dufus. Am I a hipster dufus?
JERRY_AND_GEORGE ... no...
KRAMER Said I'm not good looking enough for her. Not good looking! Jerry, look at me, look at my face, huh, am I beautiful? George, am I beautiful?
GEORGE ...you're very attractive...
KRAMER yeah... she says she doesn't wanna see me again. Told me to drop dead!
JERRY Drop dead?
GEORGE Boy, even I never heard that one...
JERRY She's pretty rough!
KRAMER Yeesh-jip!
GEORGE Well, we just blew 240 bucks on a wheelchair.
JERRY 240 bucks?
GEORGE Well, it was slightly used...
JERRY Used?
FRANK I don't think you did such a good job on these...
GEORGE What!?
FRANK You're supposed to your face there! Do you see your face in there?
FRANK Yeah? ...oh really?...oh... how about that?... Right down a hill huh? Okay! Alight! Bye!
FRANK George, forget about the shoes. Want you to do something for me . This handicapped woman had an accident. Somebody gave her a used wheelchair with defective brakes.
GEORGE Sons of bitches!
FRANK Anyway, I want you to pick up this big screen TV, and deliver it to her.
GEORGE Big screen TV?
FRANK Do you think you can handle it?
ALISON Yes?
GEORGE Hi, we're from the United Volunteers, we've come to pick up the TV.
ALISON Oh great, it's right over there.
KRAMER Ooh, it's a big one! {All four inside a delivery van outside the mall
GEORGE Who's got the receipt?
ELAINE I do.
GEORGE Will they give us cash?
JERRY That's their policy.
GEORGE I hate this mall, there are never any spaces here...
KRAMER Why don't you park in front of the hydrant?
GEORGE What if there is a fire?
KRAMER What are the chances of that?
JERRY You know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation. But it's really like one of the only jobs where you have to have your diploma right up there on the wall. It makes them seem so insecure, doesn't it? "I really am a doctor you know. You think I'm not, just check it out." I don't know why they need these little bits of psychological leverage over us all the time. "Go in that little room, take your pants off, wait 15 minutes, and I'll give you my opinion." After that, anyone that comes in with pants on seems like they know what they're talking about. In any difference of opinion, pants always beats no-pants.
GEORGE Can I say one word to you? Lobster. The lobster here is unbelievable. Ooh, a little expensive.
GEORGE'S_GIRLFRIEND Twenty five dollars.
GEORGE Yes, well, you know, I'm not thinking about the price. You know you're the only woman I've never thought about the price. Get the lobster. I beg you to get the lobster. Go for the lobster.
GEORGE'S_GIRLFRIEND George, George, uh, I think we have to talk. I think we have a problem.
GEORGE We do?
GEORGE'S_GIRLFRIEND We can't keep seeing each other.
GEORGE Why?
GEORGE'S_GIRLFRIEND Because it's over. sob, sob, sob It's my parents, the differences in our religion. Oh George, can you ever forgive me? sob
WAITER Uh, have you decided yet?
GEORGE'S_GIRLFRIEND Yes. I'll have the lobster.
GEORGE Um, you know I'm starting to think that maybe lobster isn't the way to go.
JERRY Then he asked you out?
ELAINE We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then he put his hand on my heart.
JERRY On your heart?
ELAINE Jerry, the man is a doctor.
JERRY Doctor? He's a podiatrist.
ELAINE It's the same thing.
JERRY Anyone can get into podiatry school. George got into podiatry school.
ELAINE Really?
JERRY'S_GIRLFRIEND Hello.
JERRY Oh hi.
JERRY'S_GIRLFRIEND Are you going to be stopping by later?
JERRY Yes, I'll be stopping. See you later. Well we can't all be dating podiatrists.
GEORGE It's over.
ELAINE What?
JERRY How did you get in?
GEORGE Kramer.
ELAINE What's that?
GEORGE Lobster.
JERRY Looks like a swan.
GEORGE She says we can't go out anymore.
ELAINE Why?
GEORGE Because I'm not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents won't let her get involved with anyone who isn't Latvian Orthodox.
ELAINE Latvian Orthodox? Mmm, it is lobster.
JERRY She's limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? Too bad.
GEORGE I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well that's not entirely true.
ELAINE Mmm, delicious.
JERRY Mmm, succulent.
GEORGE She knew I didn't have a job, she knew I lived at home. Didn't seem to bother her. I think I could have married this woman.
ELAINE Why don't you just ask her parents?
GEORGE I can't. I met them. They're devout. You know, In the cab on the way over here, I actually thought about converting.
JERRY To Latvian Orthodox?
GEORGE Why not? What do I care?
JERRY You know it's not like changing toothpaste.
ELAINE I think it would be romantic.
GEORGE Really?
ELAINE Yeah, it's like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne and marrying Mrs. Simpson. Ooh.
GEORGE King Edward. King Edward, Jerry.
JERRY Yeah well King Edward didn't live in Queens with Frank and Estelle Costanza.
GEORGE You know what? I could probably do this. What's the difference.
ELAINE George I was just kidding around.
GEORGE No. I wouldn't even have to tell her. I could surprise her.
ELAINE George I wasn't serious.
GEORGE How hard could it be? You make a little contribution, have a ceremony. I am going to think about this. I am really going to think about this.
ELAINE I guess this one is my fault.
JERRY Oh yeah.
JERRY'S_GIRLFRIEND kiss, kiss, kiss Oh that was nice. Have you always been such a good kisser?
JERRY Oh I don't know. Not always. No I uh I had to work at it. When I was a kid all the kids would be out playing, I would be up in my room practicing my kissing.
JERRY'S_GIRLFRIEND Well it was worth it. kiss I'll be kiss right kiss back kiss. Where are you going?
JERRY To wash my hands. They're sticky from the orange.
JERRY'S_GIRLFRIEND Meet you back here?
JERRY Right there.
JERRY "Fungicide". Fungus?
JERRY Fungicide. I mean what could she have?
ELAINE I don't know.
KRAMER Fungus.
ELAINE So what did you say?
JERRY I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I had to go home.
ELAINE What were you doing opening her medicine cabinet?
JERRY I didn't open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little.
ELAINE You were snooping.
JERRY I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was no breaking and entering. I wouldn't do that.
KRAMER I would. I always open medicine cabinets.
ELAINE Well I trust people not to do that.
KRAMER Big mistake.
JERRY Why don't you ask that doctor what it is?
ELAINE What? Now he's a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist.
JERRY But that's what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. They're knee- deep in fungus. This guy know fungus.
ELAINE I am not going to ask him about funguses.
KRAMER Fungi.
JERRY What?
KRAMER Fungi.
PRIEST Why do you want to accept the Latvian Orthodox faith?
GEORGE ahem In this age of uncertainty and confusion, a man begins to ask himself certain questions. How can one even begin to put into words something so um...
PRIEST Enigmatic?
GEORGE No.
PRIEST Vast?
GEORGE No not vast
PRIEST Well whatever it is, basically you like the religion.
GEORGE Yes.
PRIEST_2 Is there one aspect of the faith that you find particularly attractive?
GEORGE I think the hats. The hat convey that solemn religious look you want in a faith. Very pious.
PRIEST Are you familiar with Orthodox theology?
GEORGE Well perhaps, not to the extent that you are. But I know the basic plot. Yeah.
PRIEST Plot?
GEORGE Yeah, yeah. You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and the commandments and all that.
PRIEST_2 Well it's obvious that you are sincere in your desire.
GEORGE Oh yes I am Father. Incredibly sincere. So, uh, pffft, am I in?
PRIEST The first step would be to familiarize yourself with these texts .
GEORGE Ah hah. You see Father, I'm I'm incredibly anxious to become a member. Um, don't you offer any kind of an express conversion? A quick change?
SISTER_ROBERTA Oh I'm sorry. Father, there's a man waiting in the chapel.
PRIEST You may attend to it Sister, oh this is George Costanza. He is interested in joining the church.
SISTER_ROBERTA Oh are you? That's wonderful. Well good luck to you.
GEORGE Nice nun.
PRIEST No, Sister Roberta is not a nun. She is what we call a novice.
PRIEST_2 She won't be taking her final vows until next Thursday.
SISTER_ROBERTA May I help you?
KRAMER Oh yeah, I'm here to pick up my friend George Costanza.
SISTER_ROBERTA Well he's in with the Father.
KRAMER Oh yeah.
SISTER_ROBERTA I'm Sister Roberta.
KRAMER Oh. Kramer. Pleasure.
SISTER_ROBERTA Mine.
GEORGE I can't believe how easy it is. I'm virtually Orthodox. All I have to do is read a few books, memorize a few prayers, and I'm in the club.
JERRY That's all there is to it.
GEORGE That's all there is to it. By Christmas day I will be Brother Costanza.
JERRY And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother Costanza?
GEORGE Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence. Kramer enters. He is flinging a slinky.
JERRY Oh a slinky. Where did you get it?
KRAMER Sister Roberta gave it to me.
JERRY Why did she give you that?
KRAMER I think she liked me.
JERRY What do you mean she liked you?
KRAMER Liked me.
GEORGE Kramer, they like everybody. They're friendly people.
KRAMER No. I think I picked up on a vibe.
JERRY You picked up on a vibe, from a nun.
KRAMER Yeah, Jerry I'm telling you I have this power. And I have no control over it.
JERRY Oh hi.
JERRY'S_GIRLFRIEND I just wanted to stop by and see how you were feeling.
JERRY A little better. fake cough
JERRY'S_GIRLFRIEND If you need anything let me know.
JERRY Okay. All right bye.
GEORGE Story.
JERRY She's subletting Carol's place for a month.
GEORGE She likes you.
JERRY Yeah but there's a problem. I found a tube of a fungicide in her medicine cabinet.
GEORGE So?
JERRY So I don't know what she's using it for.
GEORGE Well how do you even know it's hers? Maybe it belonged to Carol. Did you see a name on the tube?
JERRY I didn't even think to look.
GEORGE Well take a look. It might not even belong to her.
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE People always leave old things in their medicine cabinet.
JERRY Yeah I've got this old bottle of cough medicine.
GEORGE I still have brill cream.
JERRY'S_GIRLFRIEND Hi.
JERRY Hi. Can I use your bathroom?
ELAINE You sure you don't mind?
DOCTOR No of course not. People ask me medical questions all the time.
ELAINE Well the question isn't even for me it's for a friend.
DOCTOR Elaine, I'm used to it. I'm a doctor.
ELAINE Well... podiatrist.
DOCTOR Huh?
ELAINE No no, I'm just saying you didn't really go to medical school, you went to podiatry school. Which I'm sure is very grueling in it's own way.
DOCTOR I went to podiatry school because I like feet. I chose to work with feet.
ELAINE I like feet too. I'm just saying...
DOCTOR Saying what?
JERRY'S_GIRLFRIEND How are you doing in there?
JERRY Fine all done, just looking for the soap.
JERRY'S_GIRLFRIEND No soap?
JERRY No I don't see it.
JERRY'S_GIRLFRIEND Here you go.
ESTELLE George what are you doing in there?
GEORGE What? Nothing.
FRANK You've been in there an hour.
ESTELLE You don't feel well?
GEORGE I'm fine.
ESTELLE I want to know what you're doing in there.
GEORGE Nothing.
FRANK George, open the door.
GEORGE No.
ESTELLE Georgie.
GEORGE No!
KRAMER Hey.
SISTER_ROBERTA Good evening. I hope I'm not disturbing you, but I found another toy I thought you might like.
JERRY Okay, Latvius was the son of which apostle? And I'll need that in the form of a question.
GEORGE I don't know. I can't believe they're making me take this test. Elaine enters.
JERRY Hey, did you talk to the doctor?
ELAINE No.
JERRY All right, the next time you see him show him this.
ELAINE You took her medicine.
JERRY Not on purpose. I was hoping there would be a name on the tube. When are you seeing him again?
ELAINE I don't know. We got into this whole thing about how podiatrists aren't real doctors.
JERRY How could you say that?
ELAINE It's you fault. You just got me thinking.
JERRY I was merely speaking extemporaneously.
ELAINE I've got nothing against the foot. I'm pro-foot.
JERRY Me too.
ELAINE Do you think I should call him and apologize?
JERRY Yes. He's a doctor. Elaine starts to leave.
JERRY Wait a second.
JERRY What are you doing?
GEORGE What does it look like I'm doing?
JERRY "Matthew, Luke, Paul", what you're cheating on your conversion test?
KRAMER I told you.
JERRY What?
KRAMER I told you she liked me.
JERRY Who?
KRAMER Sister Roberta.
JERRY How do you know?
KRAMER She told me. She said she's never had a man stir up all of these feelings inside of her. She's questioning her faith. She's thinking of leaving the church. Oh, uh, this power. I'm dangerous Jerry, I'm very very dangerous.
PRIEST I must say George, I was somewhat surprised at the results of your conversion test. I don't recall having seen such an impressive performance. You truly must be filled with the spirit of the Lord.
GEORGE Oh, I'm I'm full of it Father.
PRIEST_2 ...... Kramer ......
PRIEST Yes, yes I see. I'm sorry something has come up.
GEORGE Oh, I understand.
KRAMER Um, you wanted to see me Father?
PRIEST Yes. Please, sit down. Sister Roberta came to see me yesterday.
KRAMER I know what this is about Father. I didn't do anything. I just spoke to her innocently for just a few minutes. It's just that, that I have this power.
PRIEST Yes. Kavorka.
KRAMER Kavorka?
PRIEST It is a Latvian word which means "the lure of the animal".
KRAMER I don't understand.
PRIEST Women are drawn to you. They would give anything to be possessed by you.
KRAMER Help me Father. Help me.
PRIEST Yes, yes I will help you. Listen very carefully. I want you to buy ten cloves of garlic, three quarts of vinegar, six ounces...
JERRY What is that stench? I got it. Ah hah.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey. What are you doing?
KRAMER I've got the Kavorka Jerry.
JERRY The Kavorka? What's that?
KRAMER The lure of the animal. I'm dangerous.
JERRY What is this thing around your neck?
KRAMER The priests they're helping me. I just bathed in vinegar.
JERRY You know you're funcifying the whole building.
KRAMER Keep away Jerry. Keep away.
JERRY Kramer. Kramer.
WOMAN George Costanza? Estelle's son?
ESTELLE Latvian Orthodox? Why are you doing this?
GEORGE For a woman.
FRANK A woman? What are you out of your mind?
ESTELLE Why can't you do anything like a normal person?
FRANK Wait. Is this the group that goes around mutilating squirrels?
GEORGE No it's a regular religion.
FRANK I'm calling my lawyer. It might not be too late to get out of this.
GEORGE I don't want to get out of it.
ESTELLE George, you don't know what you're saying. You're under their control.
FRANK What, they brainwashed you?
GEORGE No no.
FRANK You're not performing any rituals in this house.
ESTELLE Go back to the psychiatrist. I beg you.
FRANK And stay away from those squirrels. At Jerry's girlfriend's apartment.
JERRY'S_GIRLFRIEND Oh how you doing Jerry?
JERRY Good. What's the matter?
JERRY'S_GIRLFRIEND I'm tired. I hardly slept last night with all this scratching. Bonkers was going crazy.
JERRY Bonkers?
JERRY'S_GIRLFRIEND My cat. He's got this weird sort of skin condition. Some type of fungus, I couldn't find his medicine.
JERRY Oh it's your cat!
JERRY'S_GIRLFRIEND What?
JERRY Ooh, nothing. At the church.
PRIEST Are you ready my son?
GEORGE Yes faddah.
PRIEST What did you say?
GEORGE What?
PRIEST I thought you said faddah.
GEORGE I said faddah, I meant Father. Just a little bit nervous.
KRAMER How you doing?
WOMAN Get away from me you creep.
KRAMER Yes, Yes. It worked. Sister Roberta I've still got time to catch her.
PRIEST Congratulations George. Welcome to the faith. Sister Roberta would you please offer the final benediction.
SISTER_ROBERTA I can't. I'm sorry. It's a beautiful religion, but I am not worthy of it. I found something else.
SISTER_ROBERTA Him.
CROWD Kavorka, Kavorka.
ELAINE kiss, kiss Because I love the foot. I'm a big fan of the foot.
DOCTOR Well it's my fault. I got a little defensive.
ELAINE And that pinkie toe, come on . How adorable is the pinkie toe.
DOCTOR It's my favorite toe.
ELAINE Let's face it, you get a bunion, where are you going? You're not going to the ear guy.
DOCTOR No you're not.
ELAINE I'll be right back.
DOCTOR Oh uh, where's the bathroom?
ELAINE It's right down here to the left. I will meet you right back here.
JERRY Elaine it's her cat. Her cat had the fungus. So I need the tube back.
DOCTOR "Fungicide"? Fungus?
SISTER_ROBERTA Something's wrong. I don't feel the same lure.
KRAMER You don't?
SISTER_ROBERTA What have I...? I must return to the church. By the way you really need to take a bath. You stink.
KRAMER Yeah yeah.
GEORGE'S_GIRLFRIEND For me?
GEORGE Well I didn't do it for my mother.
GEORGE'S_GIRLFRIEND I'm really flattered. But I just don't feel ready to make a commitment yet. Maybe when I get back from Latvia.
GEORGE Latvia?
GEORGE'S_GIRLFRIEND Yes. I'm going to stay with some relatives there for a year. Isn't it great?
GEORGE Enjoy, enjoy.
GEORGE'S_GIRLFRIEND Oh George, you are so sweet. Don't ever change.
GEORGE I'd like a doggie bag for this please.
JERRY To me, going to the health club, you see all these people and they're working out, and they're training and they're getting in shape but the strange thing is nobody is really getting in shape for anything. The only reason that you're getting in shape is that so you can get through the workout. So we're working out, so that we'll be in shape, for when we have to do our exercise. This is the whole thing. The other thing I don't get about it, is why we're so careful about locking up our dirty towels and smelly jock-straps. What exactly is the black market on these disgusting gym clothes? I give my car to any valet guy in front of a restaraunt because he has a short red jacket, yeah he must be the valet guy, I don't even think about it but my stinking, putrified gym clothes, I got one of these locks you could put a bullet through it and it won't open. That stuff is safe.
KRAMER Wide open, I was wide open underneath! I had three inches on that guy. You two were hogging the ball.
GEORGE Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the ball. All you do is dribble.
JERRY I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker.
GEORGE Oh I'm a chucker.
JERRY That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.
GEORGE I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker, I do not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, no chuck!
JERRY You chuck.
GEORGE Kramer am I a chucker?
KRAMER You're a chucker.
GEORGE All these years I've been chuckin' and you've never told me?
JERRY Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.
KRAMER Hey you know this is the first time we've ever seen each other naked.
JERRY Believe me I didn't see anything.
KRAMER Oh, you didn't sneak a peak?
JERRY No, did you?
KRAMER Yeah, I snuck a peak.
JERRY Why?
KRAMER Why not? hey what about you George?
GEORGE yeah, I ... I snuck a peak. ... But it was so fast I didn't see anything. It was just a blur.
JERRY I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't want to have.
KRAMER Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. I'll see you later.
JERRY All right
KRAMER Have a good one.
JERRY All right
GEORGE See ya.
GEORGE look at this guy. Does he have to stretch in here?
JERRY You know who that is? That's
GEORGE Keith Hernandez? The baseball player?
JERRY Yeah, that's him.
GEORGE Are you sure?
JERRY Positive.
GEORGE Wow, Keith Hernandez. He's such a great player.
JERRY Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's a Civil War buff.
GEORGE I'd love to be a Civil War buff. ... What do you have to do to be a buff
JERRY So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well sleeping less than 18 hours a day would be a start.
GEORGE ho ho ho ho. You know I only got two weeks left of unemployment. I got to prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension
JERRY Hey, should we say something to him?
GEORGE Oh, yeah I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker room.
JERRY well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind.
GEORGE He's Keith Hernandez. You're Jerry Seinfeld.
JERRY So?
GEORGE What are you comparing yourself to Keith Hernandez. The guys a baseball player Jerry, Baseball!
JERRY I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him.
GEORGE What, ... you are making some wisecracks in a night club... wo wo wo. The guy was in game six two runs down two outs facing elimination.
KEITH Excuse me. I don't want to disturb you, I'm Keith Hernandez and I just want to tell you what a big fan I am. I love your comedy.
JERRY Really?
KEITH I've always wanted to do what you do.
JERRY What I do? You are one of my favorite ball players of all time
GEORGE Mine too.
KEITH I love that bit about Jimmy Olson
JERRY Thank you.
GEORGE You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these ball clubs flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane crash? ...
KEITH Do you perform anywhere in new York right now?
JERRY I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.
GEORGE But if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, you'd think eventually an entire team would get wiped out.
KEITH You know, I live on the East Side.
JERRY I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go.
KEITH or maybe just to get together for a cup of coffee
JERRY Oh. that would be great.
GEORGE Uh, it's only a matter of time.
KEITH Who's this chucker?
JERRY It's been three days and he hasn't called.
ELAINE Well maybe you should call him.
JERRY I can't ... I can't
ELAINE Why not?
JERRY I don't know. I just feel he should call me.
ELAINE What's the difference?
JERRY You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me he has my number, he should call.
ELAINE Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes.
JERRY I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that?
ELAINE I'm sorry honey.
JERRY I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.
ELAINE No,
JERRY Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me?
ELAINE I know.
JERRY What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? I mean here I meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever met in my life. .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again.
ELAINE Sometimes I've given my number out to guys and it takes them a month to call.
JERRY Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!
ELAINE You know maybe he's been busy. Maybe he's been out of town?
JERRY Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do people say they're too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be too busy?
ELAINE Why don't you just go ahead and call him?
JERRY I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to him?
ELAINE Just ask him if he wants a to get together.
JERRY For what dinner?
ELAINE Dinner's good.
JERRY Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? .. Isn't that like a turn off?
ELAINE Jerry, He's a guy!
JERRY ... this is all .. very confusing.
JERRY When you're in your thirties it's very hard to make a new friend. Whatever the group is that you've got now that's who you're going with. you're not interviewing, you're not looking at any new people, you're not interested in seeing any applications. They don't know the places. They don't know the food. They don't know the activities, If I meet a guy in a club on the gym or someplace I'm sure you're a very nice person you seem to have a lot of potential, but we're just not hiring right now. Of course when you're a kid, you can be friends with anybody. Remember when you were a little kid what were the qualifications? If someone's in front of my house NOW, That's my friend, they're my friend. That's it. Are you a grown up.? No. Great! Come on in. Jump up and down on my bed. And if you have anything in common at all, You like Cherry Soda? I like Cherry Soda! We'll be best friends!
MRS._SOKOL You know you only have two more weeks before your benefits run out.
GEORGE Yes and I was hoping ... to get a thirteen week extension.
MRS._SOKOL So where have you been looking for work?
GEORGE Well you know what I've discovered Mrs. Sokol. It's not so much the looking as the listening. I listen for work. And as I'm looking and listening I am also looking. You can't discount looking. It's sort of a combination. It's looking, and listening, listening and looking. But you must look.
MRS._SOKOL Can you be specific about any of these companies?
GEORGE Specific, Ah, lets see. I've walked in and out of so many buildings they all .. blend in together, I uh, ..
MRS._SOKOL Well just give me one name.
GEORGE Absolutely, uh, lets see there's, uh, Vandaley Industries, I just saw them. I got very close there. very close.
MRS._SOKOL And what type of company is that?
GEORGE Latex, latex manufacturing
MRS._SOKOL And you interviewed there?
GEORGE Yes, for a sales position. Latex salesman, the selling of latex, and latex related products. They just wouldn't give me a chance.
MRS._SOKOL I'm going to need an address and a phone number for this uh, Vandaley company...
GEORGE You like gum? 'Cause I have a friend in the gum business. I got a gum guy. I make one phone call. I got boxes of delivered right to your door.

MRS._SOKOL No.
GEORGE Jose Jimenez, ... verrry funny. ..very funny.
MRS._SOKOL The address!

JERRY Uh, he's this guy who used to live in the building and they keep calling us to see the baby.
JERRY Ya' gotta see the babi - When are ya' gonna see the babi... Can't they just send us a tape?
ELAINE You know if you waited a few more months it won't be a baby anymore then you wouldn't have to see it.
JERRY uh uh because then it would be all grown up.
ELAINE yeah ha ha ha
JERRY Hey Kramer what do you think of this shirt?
KRAMER It's too busy
ELAINE It looks like you're trying too hard to make an impression on him. You're not being yourself.
KRAMER What guy?

KRAMER Who are you talkin about?
JERRY Uh, Keith uh Hernandez.

GEORGE Wa, I'm not getting out of this cab
GEORGE No, no! You can't throw me out
JERRY Hellooo Newman.
KRAMER I hate Keith Hernandez, hate him.
NEWMAN I despise him.
ELAINE Why?
NEWMAN Why? I'll tell you why...
KRAMER Let me tell it ..
NEWMAN No, you can't tell it ..
KRAMER You always tell it ..
NEWMAN All right, tell it.
KRAMER Ja ja ja - just tell it
NEWMAN June 14, 1987.... Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game.
KRAMER Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp ... ... Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, " Nice game pretty boy.". Keith continued past us up the ramp.
NEWMAN A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward.
ELAINE What was it?
KRAMER He spit on us.... and I screamed out, "I'm hit!"
NEWMAN Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me.
ELAINE Wow! What a story.
JERRY Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.
JERRY Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.
NEWMAN Well that's the way it happened.
JERRY What happened to your head when you got hit?
KRAMER Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left
JERRY Again
KRAMER Back and to the left
JERRY Back and to the left Back and to the left
ELAINE So, what are you saying?
JERRY I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.
ELAINE So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.
JERRY But that is not what they would have you believe.
NEWMAN I'm leavin'. Jerry's a nut.
KRAMER Wait, wait,
JERRY The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.
GEORGE Did anybody call here asking for Vandaley industries?
JERRY No. What happened to you?
GEORGE Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandaley Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone rings you've got to answer "Vanadaley Industries".
JERRY I'm Vanadaley Industries?
GEORGE Right.
JERRY And what is that?
GEORGE You're in latex
JERRY Latex? And what do I do with latex?
GEORGE Ya manufacture it.
ELAINE Here in this little apartment?
JERRY And what do I say about you?
GEORGE You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.
JERRY I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?
GEORGE Right.
JERRY I don't think so. Why would I do that?
GEORGE Because I asked you to.
JERRY If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff.
JERRY Yeah.
KRAMER It's Keith.
JERRY All right we're coming down.
GEORGE Keith Hernandez?
JERRY Yeah, come on Elaine, lets go.
GEORGE Where are you goin?
ELAINE He's giving me a ride You know there had to have been a second spitter. But who was it? Who had the motive?
JERRY That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.
GEORGE What the hell are you two talking about?
JERRY Well that was really fun, thanks.
KEITH Yeah, it really was.

KRAMER Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? I gotta get over to Hong Kong before it all goes back to China..
JERRY You better hurry.
GEORGE I'm gonna hit the head.
KRAMER Oh, boy, look at this. Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw. See, I always thought those would be perfect for New York.

WAITRESS Yeah, me too.
ELAINE Oh God. Why did I do this? Now I'm the office skank.

ELAINE Oh, bravo. Jerry's apartment
JERRY Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches?
KRAMER No, we've already eaten.

JERRY So, who's gonna pull this thing?
KRAMER Well, I just assumed you would.
NEWMAN Yeah, but I though-
KRAMER Da-da-da-da no.

NEWMAN Can't we worry about them later?
KRAMER To pull the rickshaw.
NEWMAN They do have an intimate knowledge of the street..
KRAMER They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap something to them?!

JERRY You're stealing too?!
MORTY Nothing. Batteries. Well, they wear out so quick.
JERRY Mom, you too?
HELEN Sometimes your father forgets, so I have to steal them.
JERRY Alright, I'll talk to you later.
KRAMER Well, the rickshaw's gone. We strapped it to a homeless guy and he , he bolted.
JERRY Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months.
KRAMER See, we should've gotten some collateral from him.. Like his bag of cans, or.. his other bag of cans.
NEWMAN We gotta find that rickshaw. You check the sewers and dumpsters. I'll hit the soup kitchens, bakeries, and smorgasbords.
JERRY To the Idiotmobile! The Coffee shop
JERRY So, even though you're not really going out with this guy, he's cheating on you?
ELAINE That is correct. But here's the beauty part - now I stand up for myself by telling everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass, and I'm the office-
JERRY Tina Turner?
ELAINE Alright.
GEORGE Well, I've to every Brentano's. This thing's flagged in every database in town!
JERRY Is it so horrible to have to keep a book?
GEORGE I don't understand what the big deal is. They let you try on pants.
JERRY Not underpants.
ELAINE Hey, that's your Uncle Leo.
JERRY Uncle Leo. Hello!
LEO Jerry.
JERRY Uncle Leo, I'm sorry. I didn't know about your.. past.
LEO You mean my crime of passion? If anyone betrays me, I never forget!
JERRY Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?!
ELAINE French impressionism. Oh, I love this. Now, what is the problem with this book?
GEORGE Nothing.
ELAINE How much do you want for it?
GEORGE You know, I could let it go for.. say.. a hundred and twenty-five.
JERRY Leo's furious. What is that doing on the table?
GEORGE Jerry, simmer down.
JERRY I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that book.
ELAINE What is wrong with this book?
GEORGE Simmer!
JERRY That book has been on a wild ride. George took it into the bathroom with him and-
ELAINE Alright! Everyone clear! Bio-hazard coming through! Clear! Clear!!
GEORGE May I ask, what do you read in the bathroom?
JERRY I don't read in the bathroom.
GEORGE Well, aren't you something? Elaine's office
PETERMAN Elaine, do you have a moment? It's about your lover.
ELAINE Oh yes. I know all about his little performance in the break room.
PETERMAN Elaine, who among us hasn't snuck into the break room to nibble on a love newton?
ELAINE Love newton?
PETERMAN I'm afraid the problem with Zach is more serious. He's back on the horse, Elaine. Smack. White palace. The Chinaman's nightcap.
ELAINE An addict? Well, it just keeps getting better!
PETERMAN And, in a tiny way, I almost feel responsible. I'm the one who sent him to Thailand - in search of low-cost whistles. Filled his head with pseudoerotic tales of my own Opium excursions. Plus, I have him some phone numbers of places he could score near the hotel.
ELAINE Look, uh, Mr. Peterman, the fact is that I was planning on breaking up with Zach anyway. He was cheating on me!
PETERMAN Damn it, Elaine. That wasn't Zach. That was the yam-yam. Now, he is going cold turkey. And you will be at his side.
ELAINE Oh. Well, you know, I had planned to uh-
PETERMAN No buts, Elaine. Or I will strip you of your 'associate' status. Uh, P.S., the first twenty-four hours are the worst. Better bring a poncho. Jerry's bedroom
HELEN It was a crime of passion.
LEO If anyone betrays me, I never forget.
HELEN He won't last a day in prison.
LEO Jerry. Hello. Jerry. Hello. Jerry. Answer that damn phone!
JERRY Hello?
ELAINE Hey, it's me.
JERRY Uncle Leo?
ELAINE Oh, that's nice. What are you up to?
JERRY Nightmares. You?
ELAINE My fake boyfriend is going through real withdrawals.
ZACH I'm burning up! Elaine!
ELAINE Eat your soup!
JERRY You're not feeding him, are you?
ELAINE Why? I told you, away from the curtains. Away. Use your bucket. There you go, that's it. You know what? I gotta go.
KRAMER Hey, buddy.
JERRY Ah! Kramer!
KRAMER I thought I heard you.
JERRY Get out of here!
NEWMAN Kramer? Kramer? There you are.
JERRY Will everybody please leave?!
NEWMAN I just heard that a postman spotted a rickshaw down in Battery Park.
KRAMER Our rickshaw?
NEWMAN It's entirely possible.
JERRY I want everyone out!
KRAMER Let's talk in Jerry's kitchen. I'll make some cocoa.
NEWMAN Good night.
JERRY Good night, Newman. Park
NEWMAN There it is!
KRAMER Rusty!
RUSTY Oh, there you are. Oh, do I get the job?
KRAMER Yeah, yeah. We'll get back to you. Let's get this baby home.
NEWMAN Uh..
KRAMER What?
NEWMAN You know, when you think about it, it's kind of silly for us both to pull this thing all t he way back uptown. I mean, after all, it is a conveyance.
KRAMER Yes, that's true.
NEWMAN So, which one of us is gonna pull?
KRAMER Well, there's only one way to settle this. One spot, two spot, zig, zag, tear, pop-die, pennygot, tennyum, tear, harum, scare 'em, rip 'em, tear 'em, tay, taw, toe..
NEWMAN Yeah.
KRAMER Best two out of three? One spot, two spot..
NEMWAN Hey, boy. Smooth it out up there. Too much jostling! A homeless charity center
REBECCA So, you want to donate this to charity?
GEORGE Well, I assume there's some sort of write-off.
REBECCA What's the value of the book?
GEORGE Uh, about two hundred dollars, Miss DeMooney.
REBECCA It's DeMornay. Rebecca DeMornay.
GEORGE Oh.
REBECCA Oh, wait a second. This book has been in the bathroom.
GEORGE Wh-what are you talking about? That - that's rediculous.
REBECCA It's been flagged. I know. I used to work in a Brentano's. Mister, we're trying to help the homeless heare - it's bad enough that we have some nut out there trying to strap 'em to a rickshaw!
GEORGE Alright, I, I'll just take fifty. Do - do we have a deal?
REBECCA Yeah, and here it is: You get your toilet book out of here, and I won't jump over this counter and punch you in the brain!
GEORGE I could take it in merchandise..
REBECCA Here I come.. Bookstore
ELAINE So, this book'll tell me how to get puke out of cashmere?
CASHIER Yeah.
ELAINE Great.
JERRY So, the worst is over?
ELAINE Yeah. Now I can break up with him. He's clean, and I'm the office hero.
JERRY Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real ones.
ELAINE Yeah, huh. I even got an idea out of it. the Detox Poncho.
ELAINE See ya.
JERRY I'd like to speak with the manager, please. NYC Street
NEWMAN Mind your pace, Boy. Chop, chop!
KRAMER Oh, I can't go on. I gotta take a break.

JERRY You defile one book, steal another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even?
GEORGE I'm goin' in!
MANAGER Did you want to speak with the manager?
JERRY Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day..
MANAGER Yes, Uncle Leo. I remember him. I'm sorry, our policy is we prosecute all shoplifters.
JERRY Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All old people steal.
MANAGER That's right. That's why we stopped carrying batteries. Look, I'll be honest with you, we've had a lot of trouble with theft lately - and my boss says I have to make an example to someone.
JERRY So it could be anyone?
MANAGER I.. guess. As long as we catch him in the act.
JERRY That guy! Swarm! Swarm!
GEORGE No! Jerry!
ELAINE Well did he bring it up in the meeting?

JERRY Golden Boy is always the first shirt I wear out of the laundry, here touch Golden Boy!
ELAINE No thanks. Yeah, Yeah I'll hold.
JERRY But see look at the collar, see it's fraying. Golden Boy is slowly dying. Each wash is brings him one step closer, that's what makes the T-shirts such a tragic figure.
ELAINE Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak in the sink with some Woolight?
JERRY No!!! The reason he's iron man is because he goes out there and plays every game. Wash!!! Spin!!! Rinse!!! Spin!!! You take that away from him, you break his spirit!

JERRY You wanna barrow Golden Boy!
ELAINE Oh! Don't you know what this means, it's like working with Tolstoy!
JERRY Hey ya know what I read the most unbelievable thing about Tolstoy the other day, did you know the original title for "War and Peace" was "War--What Is It Good For?"!
ELAINE Ha ha.

ELAINE But it's a line from that song!

JERRY Well he's kind of modest.
DIANE He was always such a goof-off. I mean did he ever get anywhere?
JERRY Sure.
DIANE Yeah? What field?
JERRY Marine biology.
DIANE George is a marine biologist?!
JERRY A pretty damn good one, too!
DIANE I can't believe it I mean I would never had thought..

GEORGE Yeah! How'd she look.
JERRY She looked great. She asked about you.

JERRY "How's George?"
GEORGE George! She said George? She remembered my name. Diane DeConn remembered my name. She was the "it" girl!
JERRY Yeah she asked for your number, I think she's gonna get in touch with you.
GEORGE Ok, I'm tellin' you right now if your kiddin' around I'm not gonna be able to be friends with you anymore. I'm serious about that. You got that.
JERRY I got no problem with that.
GEORGE Good. Cause if this is a lie, if this is a joke, if this is your idea of some cute little game...we're finished!
JERRY Expect a call.
GEORGE Oh my god he's not kidding.
JERRY Now I should tell you at this point she's under the impression the you are a.....
GEORGE A what?
JERRY A marine biologist.
GEORGE A marine biologist....why am I a marine biologist?
JERRY I may have mentioned it.
GEORGE But I'm not a marine biologist!
JERRY I'm aware of that.
GEORGE So?
JERRY You don't think it's a good job.
GEORGE I didn't think it was a job.
JERRY Oh. It's a fascinating field!
GEORGE What if she calls. What will I say?
GEORGE Algae, obviously plankton, I don't know what else I can tell you, Oh I just got back from a trip to the Galapagos Islands, I was living with the turtles.
LIPPMAN We have got you in a very nice hotel, I don't know how you like to work but I can arrange for an office if you want.
TESTIKOV I will work in hotel...much better. I will work away from all the penny bickering and interference.
LIPPMAN You know Tolstoy use to write in the village square. The faces inspired him.
TESTIKOV He didn't need any inspiration....God spoke through his pen.
ELAINE That is so true! Although one wonders if "War and Peace" would has been as highly acclaimed as it was if it was published under it's original name "War---What Is It Good For?"
LIPPMAN What?
ELAINE Yes. Mr. Lippman. It was his mistress who insisted he called it "War and Peace." "War--What Is It Good For." Absolutely nothin'! that's the song that they got from Tolstoy.
LIPPMAN I'm sorry, it's just her sense of humor.
TESTIKOV What is that noise!
LIPPMAN What is that?
ELAINE It's coming from my purse. It must be my new organizer, here.
LIPPMAN Elaine...here!
TESTIKOV Turn it off.
LIPPMAN It's the top one!
ELAINE I'm trying!
TESTIKOV Here!
JERRY I did it for you.
GEORGE Yeah, but what did you have to tell her that for. You put me in a very difficult position, Marine Biologist! I'm very uncomfortable with this whole thing.
JERRY You know with all do respect I would think it's right up your alley.
GEORGE Well it's not up my alley! It's one thing if I make it up. I know what I'm doin, I know my alleys! You got me in the Galapagos Islands livin' with the turtles, I don't know where the hell I am.
JERRY Well you came in the other day with all that whale stuff, the squeaking and the squealing.
GEORGE Why couldn't you have made me an architect? You know I always wanted to pretend that I was an architect. Well I'm supposed to see her tomorrow, I'm gonna tell her what's goin on. Maybe she likes me for me.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER Hey ya want these I don't want em!
JERRY What?
KRAMER I stink! I can't play! The ball is just sitting there, Jerry, and I can't hit it! I only hit one really good ball that went way out!
JERRY Well what happened?
KRAMER I have no concentration!
JERRY What, what, what's wrong with you?
KRAMER Sand, I can get rid of the sand. Look there is still some in here, it won't go away! Look I even got sand in the pockets!
JERRY Hey you're getting it all over the floor!
JERRY Hello....yeah....yes it is....really....oh. Can you hold on a second? Hey listen to this, some woman found an electronic organizer, my name was in it, she wants me to help track down the owner.
GEORGE How'd she find it?
JERRY It hit her in the head!
CORINNE So I am walkin' along, minding my own business when all off the sudden this thing come flying out off no were and cunks me right on the head.
JERRY Ya.
CORINNE Yeah, So they took me to the hospital and they put me in this thing that fells like a coffin for forty-five minutes. Have you ever been in one of those things? You could go berserk in there!
JERRY Well you have insurance...
CORINNE I wish!
JERRY Unbelievable!
CORINNE Yeah.
JERRY What is with this thing.
CORINNE I don't know, it never shuts up. So anyway, you can see why I would be interested in finding this person.
JERRY Absolutely. You should not have to pay for that.
CORINNE Stop it! Stop it!
JERRY Let me have a look at this thing.
CORINNE Yeah know somebody told me they thought they saw it coming out of a limousine.
JERRY Typical rich people, using the world for their personal garbage can.
CORINNE Boy am I lucky your name came up. I just pushed a button.
JERRY I would like to know what my name is doin in this creep's organizer to begin with.
CORINNE Ya.
JERRY Who do I even know that would have been in a limousine yesterday anyway. OHHHH!
KRAMER Oh, hey.
ELAINE Hey, "great" organizer that you gave me.
KRAMER Oh, you like it huh.
ELAINE It wouldn't stop beeping in the car so Testikov through it out the window.
KRAMER Oh.
ELAINE I transferred everything in there. I threw out my old book. I'm lost now, Kramer.
ELAINE What, what is it?
KRAMER The sand, it's everywhere!
ELAINE Ok I'll see you later.
JERRY Oh, there you are!
ELAINE There you are!
JERRY So?
ELAINE So?
JERRY So what do you have to say for yourself?
ELAINE So what do you have to say for yourself?
JERRY Why should I have anything for say for myself?
ELAINE "War-- What is it go for?"!
JERRY Ha Ha, who told you?
ELAINE Ha ha ha. Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer!
JERRY You told Testikov that Tolstoy wanted to name his book "War-- What is it Good For?"?
ELAINE Ya know what happened?
JERRY Can I take a guess?
ELAINE Please.
JERRY Oh I don't know, he threw your organizer out the window?
ELAINE What, how did you know that?
JERRY Because I know who has it.
ELAINE What, how did you find it?
JERRY Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found my name in it, called me up, and we met!
ELAINE Well where is it, give it to me!
JERRY I don't have it!
ELAINE Why not.
JERRY Because she's not returning it until she gets the money back for the hospital bill.
ELAINE But I didn't do Testikov did it, he should have to pay for it!
JERRY How much is Testikov getting from Pendman for this book?
ELAINE One million.
JERRY Well that's a start.
GEORGE Then of course with evolution the octopus lost the nostrils and took on the more familiar look that we know today. But if you look really closely you can still see a bump where the nose use to be.
DIANE Really?
GEORGE Yeah, but enough about fish I can talk about other things like... architecture...
JERRY You know what room Testikov's in?
ELAINE Ya, 308. I'm crazy for doing this!
JERRY Well, you want to get your organizer back don't you?
ELAINE Why are you so interested, you want to take her out?
JERRY You know when Super Man saves someone no one asks if he's trying to hit on her!
ELAINE Well you're not Super Man.
JERRY Well you're not Louis Lane.
ELAINE Oh. Listen, you have the tape-recorder.
JERRY Ya, are you sure you want to do this.
ELAINE Ya I got to get Testikov on tape. If this woman ends up in the "New England Journal Of Medicine" I'm not going to pay for it.
JERRY Ah, here she comes.
JERRY Hi, Elaine, this is Corinne.
ELAINE Hi, you got the organizer?
JERRY All right lets go. We'll meet you back here in ten minutes hopefully with the money.
DIANE Your parents must be so proud of you, George.
GEORGE Oh, they're busting!
DIANE What are those people doing over there?
TESTIKOV What, What is it! Oh! Come in. That is if you can spare a minute from your busy schedule! And you bring guest for my entertainment?
ELAINE Um, yes this is my friend Jerry. He accompanied me, ya know, single woman alone in a big city could be dangerous.
JERRY Yes. That's why I where these sneakers, in case of any trouble and zip, I'm gone.
TESTIKOV Yeah, Yeah. The sneakers. The Americans and their sneakers. Always running from something. Well, sit stop running, two minutes and I'll give you the latest manuscript!
JERRY Oh! Ramscy, great great book if I my say so sir. I almost read the whole thing.
CORINNE What!
HOTEL_CLERK If you can't thing off I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
CORINNE I'm waitin for two people!
HOTEL_CLERK Well you can wait for them outside.
CORINNE Yeah I guess I'd better. Wouldn't want to take any attention away from the hookers!
HOTEL_CLERK All right, All right. Out, Out.
CORINNE What ever you say Cro..w-well!
DIANE What's going on over here?
WOMAN_AT_BEACH There is a beached whale, she's dying.
VOICE Is anyone here a marine biologist?
TESTIKOV Here is the latest draft. I see you next week. Same time, same place. On time please.
JERRY It was nice meeting you, real pleasure!
ELAINE Oh, by the way Mr. Testikov do you remember the other day when we were in the limo and my organizer started beeping and you threw it out the window?
TESTIKOV How could I forget?
ELAINE Well would you believe that it hit actually somebody in the head.
JERRY Right in the head!
ELAINE Boing!
TESTIKOV What is that noise!
ELAINE Um ,nothing.
TESTIKOV What is the noise!
ELAINE Hey that's my purse!
TESTIKOV A recorder!
ELAINE No that's a radio..
TESTIKOV You were spying on me!
ELAINE No I wasn't.
CROWD Come on! Save the whale! Hurry up it's gonna die!
DIANE Save the whale George... for me.
GEORGE So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified! But I pressed on and as I made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment I was a marine biologist!
ELAINE George I was just reading this thing in the papers, it's amazing!
GEORGE I know I was just telling them the story.
KRAMER Come on George, finish the story.
GEORGE The sea was angry that day my friends, like an old man trying to return soup at a deli!
GEORGE I got about fifty-feet out and then suddenly the great beast appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he gave out a big bellow. I said, "Easy big fella!" And then as I watched him struggling I realized something was obstructing his breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fish!
JERRY Mammal.
GEORGE Whatever.
KRAMER Well, what did you do next?
GEORGE Then from out of nowhere a huge title wave lifted, tossed like a cork and I found myself on top of him face to face with the blow-hole. I could barely see from all of the waves crashing down on top of me but I knew something was there so I reached my hand and pulled out the obstruction!
KRAMER What is that a Titleist? A hole in one eh.
JERRY Well the crowd most have gone wild!
GEORGE Oh yes they did Jerry they were all over me. It was like Rocky 1. Diane came up to me, threw her arms around me, and kissed me. We both had tears streaming down our faces. I never saw anyone so beautiful. It was at that moment I decided to tell her I was not a marine biologist!
JERRY Wow! What'd she say?
GEORGE She told me to "Go to hell!" and I took the bus home.
JERRY All right lets go.
ELAINE Are you in a bad mood?
JERRY No, I just got my laundry back.
ELAINE Ohhh! GoldenBoy?
JERRY He didn't make it.
ELAINE I'm sorry.
JERRY This is GoldenBoy's son, BabyBlue.
KRAMER What's with you?
GEORGE Sand. It's everywhere
JERRY You remember a few years ago in New York, we had the doorman strike? They have a union, in the fancy buildings, and they went out on strike. Now you wouldthink, if any group of people would not wanna demonstrate what life would be like without them, it would be doormen. "Let's see how they do without us!" There's no doorman, people open the door, they walk in, it's... you know. Who's gonna walk out next? The guys who clean your windshield at the traffic light, with the dirty rag? "We demand shorter yellows, and longer reds!"
DOORMAN Whoah, whoah, whoah. May I help you?
JERRY Yeah, I'm just going up to see Elaine Benes.
DOORMAN Benes? No-one here by that name.
JERRY Oh, she's uh, she's house-sitting for Mr. Pitt.
DOORMAN Oh. House-sitting, mmm.
JERRY Yeah.
DOORMAN What're you, the boyfriend? Here for a... quickie?
JERRY Can I just go up?
DOORMAN Oh, I get it. Why waste time making small talk with the doorman? I should just shut up and do my job, opening the door for you.
JERRY How 'bout those Knicks?
DOORMAN Oh, I see. On the sports page...
JERRY Yeah.
DOORMAN ...What makes you think I wasn't reading the Wall Street page? Oh, I know, because I'm the uneducated doorman.
KRAMER So, you think your parents'll get back together?
GEORGE I hope so. I can't take him living with me much longer. He makes this kasha, it stinks up the whole house.
KRAMER Hey, George, stick 'em up.
GEORGE What?
KRAMER For these German tourists. Pretend that I'm robbing you.
GEORGE Why?
KRAMER So these people can go back home and tell their friends they saw a real New York mugging. It'll give them a thrill.
KRAMER Awright, hands up, porky!
KRAMER That's it. Now, gimme your wallet. Got it in here, huh, fat boy!
KRAMER Is that all you got?! Hah? Is that all you got?!
GEORGE Alright, that's enough.
KRAMER I'll tell you when it's enough! Alright, now you better not say anything, or I'll stalk you!
ELAINE Where've you been? We're gonna miss the movie, let's go. Elaine collects her bag, in readiness to leave.
JERRY I am not going back down there. I can't face that guy again.
ELAINE What guy?
JERRY The doorman. I don't wanna play anymore of his mindgames. What time does he get off?
ELAINE Six. But then the night doorman comes on. He's much scarier. Whugh! Ha-ha.
JERRY Well, it's almost six now. Can't we just wait til he goes home?
ELAINE i...
JERRY We'll still make the movie.
ELAINE Okay, okay.
GEORGE What'd you do today, dad?
FRANK Today, I went record shopping in Greenwich Village. I bought this record, but I can't seem to find the hi-fi.
GEORGE I don't have a hi-fi.
FRANK Didn't I give you my old record player?
GEORGE I gave it to Cosmo.
FRANK Cosmo? Who's Cosmo?
KRAMER I'm Cosmo.
FRANK Well, I want it back. I wanna listen to that cha-cha record.
KRAMER One-two, cha-cha-cha.
GEORGE Alright, alright. Can we go out and eat?
FRANK Lemme change my shirt.
ELAINE Jerry, it's six. Let's go.
JERRY Uh, that doorman's still milling around outside. He's very peculiar.
ELAINE No, don't...
JERRY Hello? Oh, hi Mr. Pitt.
ELAINE Give that to me.
ELAINE Hello Mr. Pitt. How's Scotland?
MR._PITT Elaine, are you having a party?
ELAINE A party. Oh no, that was just my stupid friend Jerry.
JERRY Alright, he just left. We can go.
MR._PITT Because there's to be no entertaining while I'm gone.
ELAINE Believe me, we're not entertained. We were just leaving. Oh, can you grab those empty bottles for me.
MR._PITT I need to know what's in the mail.
ELAINE Oh, well, Mr. Pitt, there's really nothing that can't wait. We're trying to catch a movie.
MR._PITT Well, you better catch the later show, because I need to know what's in the mail.
ELAINE Alright. I can't go.
ELAINE ...Uhm, the new Time magazine. The new People...
MR._PITT Oh, who's on the cover?
DOORMAN Hey, buddy.
JERRY You? Wh...what're you doing here? You work at this building too?
DOORMAN Ah, sure. Poor doorman has to work two jobs to put food on the table for mother and baby. No, I live here. That's okay, isn't it?
JERRY So you work all day as a doorman at one building. Then you come home and stand outside your own building?
DOORMAN You got a problem with that?
JERRY Look, I'm not going in your building. I really don't have to talk to you. Goodbye.
DOORMAN You really think you're better than me, don't you?!
GEORGE My father opened his shirt...
JERRY Yeah, and?
GEORGE Tell him, Kramer.
KRAMER He had breasts.
JERRY What d'you mean, breasts?
GEORGE Big breasts!
JERRY So what? A lot of older men have that.
KRAMER No, not these. These were real hooters.
GEORGE I was throwing up all night. It was like my own personal Crying Game.
KRAMER Well, maybe you're gonna get 'em too, George.
GEORGE Yeah, that's right. What if it's a genetic thing, like father like son?
JERRY But, your father's not bald.
GEORGE No, no no. That skips a generation. The baldness gene comes from your grandfather.
JERRY Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother.
KRAMER You know, Frank can't be too comfortable with those things clanging around. He should wear something for support.
GEORGE You mean like a bra?
KRAMER A bra is for ladies. I'm talking about a support undergarment specifically designed for men.
JERRY Boy, that brain never stops working, does it?
KRAMER I tell you, I'm gonna go noodle with this.
BUXOM_WOMAN Hey, we're twins.
GEORGE What!!
BUXOM_WOMAN Our shirts. They're the same.
GEORGE Oh, Huh, imagine that.
ELAINE What? What'd you say to the doorman?
JERRY What? Nothing.
ELAINE He claims that you followed him home, and started harassing him.
JERRY What has this guy got a personal vendetta with me?! What'd I do to him? 'Cos I asked him about the Knicks?
ELAINE Hey, did you make the movie?
JERRY No.
ELAINE You wanna go tonight? You can pick me up.
JERRY Alright. Can we go to a later show, so he's off his shift when I come by?
ELAINE Ugh. So now we have to rearrange our lives to avoid the doorman?
JERRY Yes, we do.
ELAINE What is wrong with George?
JERRY He's... trying to get something off his chest.
GEORGE Alright, I gotta try and talk my mother into taking him off my hands.
DOORMAN Help you?
JERRY Hoh! What're you doing here? You're supposed to be gone.
DOORMAN I traded shifts with the night doorman. He had some personal affairs to attend to. You see, my fellow doorman and I watch out for each other. We don't stab each other in the back, like people in your world.
JERRY Look, I don't want any trouble. I don't have a doorman in my building. I guess I'm just not used to talking to them. I'd really just like to be friends.
DOORMAN You wanna be friends?
JERRY I'd like to be.
DOORMAN Then watch the door for a minute, would you?
JERRY What?
DOORMAN Yeah, I just wanna run and get a beer. I'll be back in a minute.
JERRY Wha...? Wai... wait a second. What do I do?
DOORMAN It's not brain surgery. You open the door for people who live here. And, if they don't live here, don't let them in. Here. Wear that.
JERRY Oh.
JERRY Hey, hey. Wait a second. Hey! Hello!
JERRY Hey, hey, wait a second. You live here?
MR._GREEN Of course I live here. I've lived here for twenty years. Now, if you don't let me in, I'm going to call the police and have you arrested.
JERRY You think you're better than me?
DELIVERY_GUY You have to sign for it.
JERRY Oh, right.
DELIVERY_GUY Hey, how 'bout those Knicks, huh?
JERRY Yeah, yeah, yeah.
KRAMER Hey. I uh, brought back your record player, huh.
FRANK Thank you, Kramer.
KRAMER Yeah.
FRANK Put it over there.
KRAMER So, how you feeling?
FRANK Tired.
KRAMER Uh huh. Your back hurt?
FRANK How did you know?
KRAMER Well, it's obvious, you know. You're carrying a lot of extra baggage up there.
FRANK Up here?
KRAMER Oh, yeah. Top floor. Listen, Frank, have you ever considered wearing something for support? Now, look at this. Mind you, this is just a prototype.
FRANK You want me to wear a bra?!
KRAMER No, no. A bra is for ladies. Kramer holds the garment up to his own chest.
KRAMER Meet, the bro.
ESTELLE So, is your father excited about coming home?
ESTELLE George?
GEORGE Hey mom. What kind of woman was grandma?
ESTELLE All of a sudden you're interested in your grandmother?
GEORGE Well, you know. You get to a certain point, you wanna know about your roots.
ESTELLE She was a lovely woman.
GEORGE Yuh. What about physically?
ESTELLE Physically?
GEORGE Yeah, you know, what'd she uh, look like?
ESTELLE Well, you've seen pictures.
GEORGE You can't tell much from those pictures.
ESTELLE So what?
GEORGE Was she uh, was she a big, uh woman?
ESTELLE Big? No, just my height.
GEORGE Bosomy?
ESTELLE Bosomy? You wanna know if your grandmother was bosomy?!
GEORGE No, I was just wondering. The information could be relevant.
ESTELLE Where do you get your genes from?!
GEORGE That's what I'd like to know.
ELAINE I can't believe you left your post.
JERRY He left me there. You see the mind games?
ELAINE Hey, what's up? What's going on here?
TENANT_1 Somebody stole the couch out of the lobby.
TENANT_2 Where's the doorman? How come someone wasn't watching the door?
ELAINE Jerry, let's get out of here.
JERRY Yeah.
ESTELLE Oh, my god!
ELAINE What were you doing watching the door anyway?
JERRY He asked me to. We were getting along.
ELAINE You know, my fingerprints are all over this. That doorman knows you're a friend of mine. He'll tell that co-op lady, she'll tell Mr. Pitt... Jerry, I'm in this too deep.
JERRY Don't you find it odd that as soon as he leaves, the couch gets stolen? Maybe he's setting me up!
ELAINE Alright, shut up. Shut up. Just let me think. I gotta think. We gotta get our story straight.
JERRY Alright, well what if we say...
ELAINE Alright, here it is. This is what we'll tell 'em. You came to pick me up...
JERRY I came to pick you up.
ELAINE Yeah. That's what I just said.
JERRY I know. I was just...
ELAINE Yeah, I know what you were just. It's not helping.
JERRY Alright, well. Just, start again, then.
ELAINE Okay, you came to pick me up at...
JERRY Right.
ELAINE You see? Again.
JERRY What? I said right.
ELAINE Alright, you came right upstairs, without talking to the doorman.
JERRY But the doorman's gonna say that I was there.
ELAINE So what? No-one's gonna believe a doorman!
JERRY But I don't know if this is gonna work.
ELAINE Just stick with the story. We'll be fine. Let me do the talking!
JERRY Okay.
ELAINE Good. Now fix me a drink.
KRAMER How's that feel?
FRANK This feels very comfortable.
KRAMER You see?
FRANK I feel ten years younger.
KRAMER Yeah, and your posture's a lot better. Look at you.
FRANK And I can breathe easier, too.
KRAMER I told you! Now, Frank, listen. Here's what I'm thinking. Now, you have a friend in the bra business, right?
FRANK Of course. Sid Farkus. He's the best in the business.
KRAMER Here's our chance. What d'you say? It'll be me, you and the bro, bro.
FRANK Let's do it!
FRANK Except, we gotta do something about the name.
KRAMER Why, what's wrong with bro?
FRANK No, bro's no good. Too ethnic.
KRAMER Alright, you got something better?
FRANK How 'bout uh... the mansiere?
KRAMER Mansiere?
FRANK That's right. A brassiere for a man. The mansiere, get it?
GEORGE Well, you've scared her off. We may never see mom again.
FRANK Hey George, what d'you like better? The bro, or the mansiere?
GEORGE Dad. We need to talk.
DOORMAN I had to use the bathroom, so I asked this guy to watch the door for a few minutes.
MRS._PAYTON Why should I believe you?
DOORMAN Actually, it was her friend.
MRS._PAYTON I was just speaking to the doorman here, about the couch robbery.
ELAINE Oh really? The doorman. And, pray tell, what did the doorman say?
MRS._PAYTON He said he asked a friend of yours to watch the door.
ELAINE Oh, my. Well, the doorman certainly has a wild imagination, doesn't he?
DOORMAN Well... what do we have here? Perhaps Miss Benes could explain why a Jerry Seinfeld signed for this package at the exact same time the couch was stolen.
ELAINE He never watched a door before, Mrs Payton, he didn't know how to do it. You know, he's a comedian, Mrs Payton, they don't know how to do anything.
ELAINE Don't you see what's going on here? He set us up. He's playing all these mindgames.
JERRY You're saying I'm responsible for the couch?
ELAINE There was nothing I could do. He said he had a Federal Express slip with your signature on it.
JERRY Diabolical. He thought of everything. He was setting me up from day one!
ELAINE Is it possible we were victims of a sting?
JERRY I'm sure he's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies.
DOORMAN_2 So, you didn't even watch the couch?
DOORMAN No. I was just messing with his head.
DOORMAN_2 And they think they're better than us?
ELAINE Anyway, Jerry... Jerry?
ELAINE We have to replace the couch.
JERRY Now we have to buy a new couch?!
GEORGE Not necessarily. Why don't you take back the couch you gave me?
JERRY The one with the Poppie stain?!
GEORGE Yeah, sure. Then my father will have no place to sleep. He's gotta move out.
ELAINE But it's got a pee-stain on it.
GEORGE No, the cushion's turned over.
ELAINE I guess.
GEORGE Yeah. You get a couch. I get rid of my father. It couldn't be more perfect!
KRAMER Now, it's called the bro.
FRANK Or, the mansiere.
KRAMER Yeah, but I prefer the bro.
FRANK I like mansiere.
FARKUS Well, I have to tell you, it's a very interesting idea.
KRAMER Yeah.
FARKUS You know, selling bras exclusively to women, we're really only utilising fifty percent of the market.
FRANK That's what we figured, huh?
KRAMER I told you.
FARKUS And, to be perfectly frank, I've always felt I could use some support. I know, when I'm wearing Banlon, there appears to be some jiggling.
FRANK I wouldn't be caught dead in Banlon. Kramer shakes his head at the very thought of Banlon.
FARKUS So uh, what d'you see in the back? Hooks? Velcro? What?
KRAMER Uh.
FRANK Definitely velcro.
KRAMER Say you're getting intimate with a woman uh, you don't want her fumbling and struggling back there.
KRAMER I think we've all experienced that.
FARKUS Summer nights.
KRAMER Very funny.
FARKUS Well, I still have to talk about this to Mr. Degrunmont...
KRAMER Of course, yes.
FARKUS ...But, barring any unforeseen developments, gentlemen, I think we're sitting on a winner.
FARKUS Frank, I wanna tell you how sorry I am to hear about you and Estelle separating.
FRANK Oh, thank you, Sid, but that's all in the past. I'm ready to move on.
FARKUS I've always been very fond of Estelle. Beautiful woman. I uh, I hope you don't think uh, this is out of line, but would it be okay with you, if I were to ask her out?
FRANK You wanna go out with my wife?! Where do you get the nerve to ask me something like that?!
FARKUS Oh, no, Frank, I was just saying...
FRANK I know what you're saying, and I know what you're thinking!!
FARKUS No, Frank...
FRANK C'mon, Cosmo, I'm not doing business with this guy.
KRAMER Frank!
GEORGE Jerry took the couch back.
FRANK He took it back? Didn't you tell him I was using it?
GEORGE Oh, I pleaded with him.
FRANK Where am I supposed to sleep?
GEORGE Well, I took the liberty of packing your things. Mom's coming to get you.
KRAMER I thought Jerry didn't want that couch, because of the stain?
FRANK What stain?
KRAMER Oh, you didn't notice? It has a pee-stain.
FRANK You had me sleeping on a pee-stained couch?
GEORGE No. No, no, no. The cushion was turned over.
FRANK But, the very idea. you had me lying in urine!!
GEORGE Ah! There's mom, there's mom. George races over and opens the door.
ESTELLE Is it safe to come in?
GEORGE Oh, of course. Of course.
ESTELLE You're not having any of your transvestite parties?
FRANK Will you stop it?
ESTELLE I lived with him for forty years, I never saw him trying on my underwear. As soon as he leaves the house, he turns into J. Edgar Hoover!
FRANK Here, Cosmo...
KRAMER Oh, hey.
FRANK ...You can have the hi-fi. I don't need it now...
KRAMER Awright, I got it.
FRANK ...I got one at home.
ESTELLE Alright, let's go. Kramer opens the door.
FRANK We'll go out for dinner tonight.
ESTELLE I can't tonight, I'm busy.
FRANK What d'you mean, busy?
ESTELLE I'm having dinner with someone.
FRANK With whom?
ESTELLE Sid Farkus.
FRANK Sid Farkus?! You're not having dinner with a bra salesman.
ESTELLE Hey, he only sells them. He doesn't wear 'em.
FRANK Okay, that's it! I'm not coming home!
GEORGE But you can't stay here. There's no place to sleep!
FRANK We'll work something out.
GERMAN_WOMAN Stop him! Ja, ja, ja, it's him!
GERMAN_WOMAN Stop that man! It's him.
GERMAN_WOMAN Somebody, stop him! Please, quick. Stop, it's him. I know, I know. Help. Stop him.
HORST Hey, hey. That record player is not yours.
KRAMER Now, look. Somebody gave it to me.
HORST You're a thief. We have proof.
HORST What is that?
KRAMER The first upper-body support undergarment, specifically designed for men.
HORST How does it connect in the back? With a hook?
KRAMER Oh, no, no. Here, velcro.
HORST Ooh, ...keine problem, ah?
HORST Is gut, ja?
MRS._PAYTON Well, I suppose it'll have to do.
ELAINE It's a beautiful couch.
JERRY It's hardly been used.
JERRY Poppie!
POPPIE Oh, hello, Jerry.
JERRY What're you doing here?
POPPIE Visiting my friend.
JERRY Ohh. Hey, how you feeling?
POPPIE Oh, much better, much better. The doctors say I cannot have no aggravation.
JERRY Hmm.
POPPIE So, I sell the restaurant, uh? I just take it easy. See, if I get excited, 'ats aggravated my condition. The last time I got aggravated, was in the restaurant. With your friend.
POPPIE She start the big fight, about abortion.
POPPIE It's you! It's you!
ELAINE Wha...?
POPPIE You! I... I gotta sit down!
JERRY No, Poppie! No!!
FRANK Kasha?
GEORGE No. Thanks, dad.
GEORGE And then I hear this rabbi on television, I mean imagine.
ELAINE I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. It was just the whole marriage thing.
GEORGE Ya know, I was just a little surprised.
JERRY Why would anyone eat canned fruit? I mean can anybody answer that?
GEORGE What about all the loser stuff?
ELAINE I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never said that. I said "I've never seen you looser".
JERRY I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit it's available, it's there, it's 2 aisles over.
GEORGE Well, scintillating as always.
JERRY Where you going?
GEORGE I'm going shopping with Susan.
ELAINE What kind of shopping?
GEORGE Clothes shopping.
ELAINE Where are you going?
GEORGE Ross'.
ELAINE Oh that's a nice store.
GEORGE Yeah, it's her uncle's.
JERRY Discount?
GEORGE One would hope.
KRAMER So ya know, my friend and I we were going to the movies and we stopped off and bought this cafe latte.
JACKIE Hm Hm. Oh what is that like Italian coffee?
KRAMER Yeah that's right.
JACKIE Half milk, half coffee?
KRAMER Yeah.
JACKIE Hm Hm. You take a sip?
KRAMER Yes I did.
JACKIE Now when you took a sip, did you notice it was hot? Were you able to sip it in your normal fashion?
KRAMER No I wasn't able to sip it in my normal fashion.
JACKIE Hm Hm. All right, all right. You take big sips?
KRAMER Well I think I take a normal sip.
JACKIE ok. You take normal sips. Nothing wrong with that. Then what happened?
KRAMER Well you know ahh, they don't allow outside drinks in the movie theater. So I had to put it in my shirt and sneak it in.
JACKIE Yeah, see they like to sell their own coffee.
KRAMER Yeah, now is that going to be a problem?
JACKIE Yeah that's going to be a problem. It's gonna be a problem for them. This a clear violation of your rights as a consumer. It's an infringement on your constitutional rights. It's outrageous, egregious, preposterous.
KRAMER It's definitely preposterous.
JACKIE So. Then what happened?
KRAMER Well ahh. I was trying to get to my seat and I had to step over someone and I kind of got pushed and it spilled on me.
JACKIE Was there a top on it?
KRAMER Yeah.
JACKIE Now did you put the top on or did they put the top on for you?
KRAMER No. They put the top on.
JACKIE And they made the top. You didn't make the top did you?
JACKIE Suzie. I want you to go down to Java World. Get me a cafe latte with a top. We're gonna run some test on that top. Have you been to the doctor?
KRAMER Ah No no, I haven't.
JACKIE Suzie. Call Dr. Bison. Set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer here. Tell him it's from me.
KRAMER So ah, what do you think Mr. Chiles.
JACKIE Jackie.
KRAMER Jackie. I mean, we have a chance?
JACKIE Do we have a chance? You get me one coffee drinker on that jury, you gonna walk outta there a rich man.
GEORGE I don't like it, it's red. It it's too flashy.
SUSAN Well you could use a little flash.
GEORGE All right. Don't change me. Susan. Don't change me. Ya know there are a lot of woman that would love to be in your position right now.
SUSAN Name one.
MR_ROSS So, you find anything?
SUSAN Oh, he's impossible to shop for uncle Ned.
MR_ROSS I'm going on vacation to Costa Rica. Maybe I'll see you in a couple of weeks.
SUSAN ok.
SALESMAN Excuse me Mr Ross.
GEORGE See now this I don't get.
SUSAN What?
GEORGE The security guard.
SUSAN What about him?
GEORGE Why does he have to stand?
SUSAN Because he's a security guard.
GEORGE But I mean look at him. He's gotta be on his feet like that all day? That's brutal. I think I'm gonna say something to your uncle.
SUSAN George, you just met him. Don't say anything to him.
GEORGE Aren't you concerned about the security guard?
SUSAN Not really.
GEORGE She's not concerned about the security guard. What kind of a person is this? I'm marrying a person who doesn't care that this man has to stand here 8 hours a day when he could easily be sitting.
SUSAN All right George. What do you think?
JERRY So ah, what did you do last night?
ELAINE Nothing.
JERRY I know nothing, but what did you actually do?
ELAINE Literally nothing. I sat in a chair and I stared.
JERRY Wow. That really is nothing.
ELAINE I told ya.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey.
ELAINE Hey.
JERRY What are you all dressed up for?
KRAMER Oh I ah just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
JERRY Oh yeah, how's that looking?
KRAMER Oh I'll tell you how it's looking. My lawyer Jackie says if there is one coffee drinker on that jury, I'm gonna be a rich man.
ELAINE That's despicable. How does he know how all coffee drinkers will vote? I'm a coffee drinker. If I was on that jury I wouldn't give you a nickel Kramer.
KRAMER Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury. He would have weeded you out.
JERRY Frankly I'm surprised you're so litigious.
KRAMER Oh I can be quite litigious.
ELAINE What I mean who ever heard of this anyway? Suing a company because there coffee is too hot? Coffee is supposed to be hot.
KRAMER Yeah but Jackie says the top was faulty.
ELAINE Jackie says the top was faulty.
KRAMER Hey Maestro!
MAESTRO Ah, Kramer.
KRAMER I'm in here. How's it going.
MAESTRO Fine.
JERRY Hi Bob.
JERRY Oh, I'm sorry. Maestro.
KRAMER Well, this is a surprise ha?
MAESTRO I just wanted to drop off this Chinese balm for your burns. It's supposed to be great stuff. It's all herbal.
KRAMER Oh Maestro, you, what are you doing? You don't have to do this. Do you believe this Maestro?
MAESTRO It's nothing.
KRAMER Yeah, ya know you haven't been around for a while.
MAESTRO Oh yeah, I've been at my house in Tuscany.
KRAMER Oh Tuscany huh? Hear that Jerry? That's in Italy.
JERRY I hear it's ah beautiful there.
MAESTRO Well if you're thinking of getting a place there don't bother. There's really nothing available.
JERRY Huh?
MAESTRO Oh!
ELAINE Hello.
MAESTRO Well Hello. And who might you be?
ELAINE I might be Elaine.
JERRY This is a, Bob Cobb.
KRAMER Maestro.
ELAINE Oh, Maestro.
MAESTRO It is my very great pleasure.
ELAINE Enchante.
MAESTRO_AND_ELAINE Well I have to be going.
ELAINE Jinx buy me a coke.
MAESTRO Oh. Love it when that happeneds.
ELAINE I know I know. That is so ahh ......
MAESTRO Coincidental.
ELAINE Yeah, thanks. ok. Bye you guys.
MAESTRO Ciao.
KRAMER Yeah, yeah oh hey and a thanks for the balm. Yeah.
KRAMER You know you hurt the Maestro's feelings.
JERRY Oh what, because I didn't call him Maestro?
KRAMER That's right.
JERRY Ya know I feel a little funny calling somebody Maestro.
KRAMER Why?
JERRY Because it's a stupid thing to be called.
KRAMER Jerry he's a conductor.
JERRY Oh conductor. He conducts the Policeman's Benevolent Association Orchestra.
KRAMER Well, he's still a conductor.
JERRY Well he sure worked pretty fast with Elaine.
KRAMER Oh, you should see him do 'Flight of the Bumble Bee'.
JERRY New shirt?
GEORGE Yeah. You like it.
JERRY No, not particularly.
GEORGE Why, the color?
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE Too flashy?
JERRY Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for you right?
GEORGE No.
JERRY All right what's it going to be here.
GEORGE Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does it bother you that they make the security guard just stand there all day?
JERRY No.
GEORGE See, didn't bother Susan either. That's why I'm different. I can sense the slightest human suffering.
JERRY Are you sensing anything right now?
GEORGE Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet, in one spot for eight hours a day. Why shouldn't he have a chair?
JERRY Well, what about criminal activity? He's got to be alert.
GEORGE What, he can't jump out of the chair? How long does that take? Here look at this. Here, watch. Criminals. Boom. I'm up. Stop It! Stop It! Stop It!
JERRY Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.
GEORGE Would you get out of here. Who's gonna turn down a chair? I would be very interested to know how he felt about all of this. Maybe I'll have a talk with him.
JERRY I know you will.
KRAMER Hey, hey, hey, listen to this. Jackie just called.
GEORGE Who?
JERRY His lawyer.
KRAMER Yeah, Java World wants to settle.
JERRY What?
KRAMER Yeah, I'm gonna be rich.
JERRY Why are they settling?
KRAMER Cause their afraid of bad publicity.
JERRY All this because you spilled coffee on yourself?
KRAMER Yeah that's right.
GEORGE I'm gonna need a coffee here. Very hot! Boiling!
MAESTRO And then about four years ago I was on holiday in Tuscany.
ELAINE Uh ha.
MAESTRO And I fell in love with this house.
WAITER Are you ready to order?
ELAINE Oh God. What are you getting Bob?
MAESTRO Good question. We'll need a few minutes.
MAESTRO You know, I'm sorry but, I didn't mention it earlier but actually I preferred to be called Maestro.
ELAINE Excuse me?
MAESTRO Well, ya know I am a conductor.
ELAINE Yeah, so?
MAESTRO Oh I suppose it's ok. for Leonard Burnstein to be called Maestro because he conducted the New York Philharmonic. So he gets to be called Maestro and I don't.
ELAINE Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called Maestro while he was conducting, not in social situations. I mean his friends probably just called him Lenny.
MAESTRO I happen to know for a fact, that he was called Maestro in social situations. I once saw him at a bar and someone came up to him and said "Hello Maestro, how about a beer". ok. So that's a fact.
ELAINE Maestro huh? ok.
KRAMER Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry my burn is gone look..
JERRY What do you mean?
KRAMER Well I put that Chinese balm on that the Maestro gave me. And look, it healed it.
JERRY So?
KRAMER So? My lawsuit. I'm finished.
JERRY I thought they wanted to settle.
KRAMER Well what happens if they want to see it?
JERRY Then you're in a lot of trouble.
KRAMER Yeah!!
GEORGE Tired?
GUARD No.
GEORGE How come uh, no chair?
GUARD What?
GEORGE I, I couldn't help but notice that uh you don't have a chair.
GUARD I don't need a chair.
GEORGE No I didn't mean to imply that you did. You're obviously a very well proportioned individual. I was just wondering, have they ever offered you a chair?
GUARD Nope.
GEORGE Would you like a chair?
GUARD I suppose if they gave me one I'd sit down.
GEORGE Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you?
GUARD Obviously I'd rather sit than stand, if that's what your asking.
GEORGE That's exactly my point.
GUARD Well who wouldn't?
GEORGE Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear one day and find you sitting down. That would give me a lot of pleasure. Call me crazy.
JACKIE You put the balm on? Who told you to put the balm on? I didn't tell you to put the balm on. Why'd you put the balm on? You haven't even been to see the doctor. If your gonna put a balm on, let a doctor put a balm on.
KRAMER I guess I screwed up huh Jackie?
JACKIE Your damn right you screwed up. Where the hell did you get that damm balm anyway?
KRAMER The Maestro.
JACKIE The who? What are you talking about Maestro?
KRAMER My friend he's a conductor.
JACKIE Oh oh oh, so a Maestro tells you to put a balm on and you do it?
KRAMER Well my stomach was burning.
JACKIE I tell you what this is. This is a public humiliation.
KRAMER Well I didn't know the balm was gonna work.
JACKIE Do you know what a balm is? Have you ever seen a balm? Didn't you read the instructions?
KRAMER Well I ...
JACKIE No one can tell what a balm's gonna do. They're unpredictable.
KRAMER I'm sorry Jackie.
JACKIE Pull over here driver this is it.
KRAMER Yeah, get over.
JERRY Did you have a good time?
ELAINE Yeah, he's very interesting. Did you know that Mozart died while he was writing 'The Requiem'.
JERRY Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus.
ELAINE Really?
JERRY So what about the "Maestro" stuff. Did he make you call him Maestro.
ELAINE Yeah, I called him Maestro.
JERRY You didn't mind?
ELAINE Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to it.
JERRY ok. from now on I want you to call me "Jerry the Great".
ELAINE I am not calling you "Jerry the Great".
JERRY Why not you call him Maestro.
ELAINE He is a Maestro.
JERRY Well, I'm great.
ELAINE So you say.
JERRY What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that?
ELAINE Yeah. I'm invited.
JERRY You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of the clear blue sky he says there's nothing to rent. As if he doesn't want anyone else there.
ELAINE Why?
JERRY I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans.
ELAINE Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there.
JERRY In all of Tuscany? I wonder.
MR_STAR I say we offer him $50,000 that's it, take it or leave it.
MR_BURNS How do we know how severe the burns are? Why don't we have him examined by a doctor.
MS._JORDAN Listen, the faster we dispose of this the better. This thing gets into the paper it will kill us.
MR_STAR All right, we'll start at 50,000 and free coffee at all of our stores.
MR_STAR Yes?
SECRETARY Mr. Chiles and Mr. Kramer are here.
MR_STAR Send them in.
MR_STAR Gentleman.
MR_STAR Gentleman come in. Now we don't want to take up much of your time. Let's make this short and sweet. We're prepared to offer you all the free coffee you want in any of our stores throughout North America and Europe, Plus..
KRAMER I'll take it!!
JACKIE I'll take it? Who told you to take it? Did I tell you to take it?
KRAMER No.
JACKIE I know the Maestro didn't tell you to take it, he wasn't there.
KRAMER Well I thought we were lucky to get anything.
JACKIE Free coffee?
KRAMER Yeah.
JACKIE I don't want free coffee. It's not hard to get coffee. I can get my own damn coffee. I wanted to hear what came after that "Plus".
KRAMER Well I didn't hear any Plus.
JACKIE 20 years practicing law I've never experienced anything like this.
KRAMER Look, Java World. Hey listen I'm gonna get out here. I'm gonna get myself a free cafe latte.
ELAINE Hey. Hi Maestro.
MAESTRO Beethoven's 7th.
ELAINE Yeah.
JERRY Hey you know we were just talking about you.
MAESTRO Oh yeah?
JERRY Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there were no houses available in Tuscany?
MAESTRO You didn't find one, did you?
JERRY No. I'm not really looking.
MAESTRO Nor should you.
JERRY So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all of Tuscany?
MAESTRO The houses are passed down from generation to generation, it's very hard.
JERRY I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?
MAESTRO It's booked solid!
ELAINE It's booked Jerry!
JERRY How'd you get yours?
MAESTRO Got lucky. Come on, Elaine, let's take a ride, I was about to pop in some Verdi.
JERRY Maybe I'll check out France.
JERRY Hey George, do you believe this guy?
GEORGE Who?
JERRY Bob Cobb.
GEORGE Bob Cobb?
JERRY You know, the Maestro.
GEORGE Oh I missed the Maestro?
JERRY Yeah, get this, he tells me there are no houses any where in Tuscany to rent.
GEORGE Huh. Your renting a house in Tuscany?
JERRY No.
GEORGE So what do you care?
JERRY I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of Tuscany.
GEORGE Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. Do you know how big Tuscany is?
JERRY I have no idea.
GEORGE It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota.
JERRY Oh, no way it's that big.
GEORGE It's a big region.
JERRY Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?
GEORGE I don't know why I bother even talking to you.
JERRY Hey, no one's got a gun to your head.
GEORGE All right.
GEORGE So I spoke to the security guard.
JERRY Yeah and?
GEORGE Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought him a chair, he'd sit.
JERRY So are you gonna get him a chair?
GEORGE Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking about a bar stool.
JERRY Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check things out. With a back or without.
GEORGE Oh I think I'd go for the back.
JERRY Swivel?
GEORGE I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's chairs. What do you think of those.
JERRY I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents used to have a kitchen chair that would have been perfect.
GEORGE You mean one of those vinyl things?
JERRY Yes.
GEORGE Vinyl yeah, maybe.
JERRY How can I figure out if there's any places to rent in Tuscany? Wait a minute. Poppy's from Tuscany. I'm gonna go call him.
GEORGE Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside.
JERRY Poppy told me to talk to his cousin, he lives down in Little Italy.
GEORGE What do you think about a rocking chair?
KRAMER You can't put a limit on my cafe lattes, it says so right here. And I don't want to get dirty looks when I come in here. If I want a cafe latte, you give me a cafe latte. And if I have any problems I'm gonna get my lawyer Jackie Chiles down here and your gonna be in really big trouble.
JERRY Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie. What what's the matter?
KRAMER Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of cafe lattes. But I'm entitled to them. I can have as many cafe lattes as I want, that was the settlement.
JERRY That's it?
KRAMER That's it. What you want one George? I can get one for you. No problem. Jerry, you want one? They're delicious. My pleasure.
JERRY You've got to stop it. Your your all hopped up on the caffein.
KRAMER Well I feel like I'm talking fast but it's very hard to tell.
JERRY You're racing!
KRAMER Well well I've got things to do. I'll see you later. Bye.
ELAINE Oh Bob! Bob!
ELAINE Maestro!
CLERK Excuse me. Can I help you?
GEORGE Nope. Just a, giving a chair to the security guard.
CLERK Did Mr. Ross tell you to do this?
GEORGE What's your name?
CLERK Evan Fayne.
GEORGE I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece. I'm probably gonna be taking over this whole place someday so if I were you I would stay on my good side.
CLERK I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.
GEORGE Innocent mistake.
GEORGE Well, here you go. What do you think?
GUARD Mr. Ross says this is ok?
GEORGE Hey, I'm his nephew, all right? Don't worry about it. Go ahead. Check it out.
GUARD Not bad. Not bad at all.
JERRY Ah, excuse me, I'm looking for a Mr. Giggio.
GIGGIO Si, Si, imma Giggio.
JERRY Poppy sent me to see you Mr. Giggio.
GIGGIO Si, Si Poppy.
JERRY Um, did he did he mention to you why I called?
GIGGIO Si, the house in Tuscana.
JERRY Yeah, right, right. So is there anything there to rent?
GIGGIO Si. Two million lira. You give me the check.
JERRY I didn't actually want to rent it.
GIGGIO The keys, here are the keys. You give me the check. Two million lira. Seventeen hundred Americana. Molto generoso.
GIGGIO Si, Si.
JERRY So see um, I didn't say that I wanted to rent it, I was just wondering if there were houses there to rent.
GIGGIO Si. Thissa one!. Capiche?
ELAINE It's been a rough couple of weeks, ya know I really needed to get away.
MAESTRO I told you, it's paradise.
ELAINE You're right Maestro.
KRAMER Common Jerry, this guy is crazy. Get out.
JERRY You didn't have to push me.
KRAMER I didn't push you. How much did you pay that guy?
JERRY 75,000 lira.
KRAMER 75,000 lira? Are you out of your mind?
JERRY Kramer you don't under the conversion rate.
KRAMER Oh, conversion rate, oh.
JERRY You know I don't even know why I brought you.
KRAMER Nobody put a gun to your head.
JERRY Not bad!
KRAMER Yeah!
JERRY I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. You know how that gets? "You need trunks son? I've got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks." Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You bump into somebody you know: "No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for the boat to come back."
HELEN They were supposed to be here at 7:30. Call the airlines again.
MORTY What happened to the scotch tape? Who takes the scotch tape? Nobody returns anything around here.
HELEN Oh I think that's them!
MORTY You what I'll do next time? I'll hide it so nobody can find it.
ALL Hi, welcome, greetings, hugs, etc.
MORTY Welcome to Florida!
ELAINE Hi Mr. Seinfeld!
JERRY Hey, there's the old man!
MORTY So, what took you so long?
JERRY We waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place.
HELEN I don't know why you had to rent a car. We would have picked you up.
JERRY What's the difference?
HELEN You could have used our car.
JERRY I don't wanna use your car.
HELEN What's wrong with our car?
JERRY Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?
HELEN We don't use it.
MORTY What are you talking? We use it.
HELEN If you were using it, we wouldn't use it.
JERRY So what would you do? You'd hitch?
HELEN How much is a rent-a-car?
JERRY I don't know. 25 bucks a day.
HELEN What? You're crazy.
MORTY Plus the insurance.
JERRY Oh, I didn't get the insurance.
MORTY How could you not get the insurance?
HELEN We'll pay for the car.
JERRY You're not paying for it.
HELEN Morty.
JERRY God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning?
HELEN You don't need the air conditioner. So, you have your speech all ready?
JERRY It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?
HELEN Of course, they're giving a testimonial for your father. You could do your comic routines.
JERRY Oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd.
ELAINE Ooh, you have a lake?
JERRY The lake isn't real.
HELEN The lake is real.
MORTY Are you kidding? They built the lake.
HELEN But it's real. It's water.
HELEN Where are you going with those?
JERRY I'm gonna put Elaine's stuff in here.
HELEN Don't sleep in there. You can you use the bedroom.
ELAINE I can't take your bedroom.
HELEN I'm up at 6 o'clock in the morning.
ELAINE I can't kick you out of your bed.
HELEN We don't even sleep.
JERRY Ma.
HELEN But this is sofa bed, you'll be uncomfortable.
JERRY What about you?
MORTY Why should I be comfortable?
JERRY What about him?
HELEN Don't worry, he's comfortable.
MORTY I'll sleep standing up. I'll be fine.
HELEN Will you stop?
ELAINE Yeah, I'll just stay in here.
HELEN Jerry. You don't have to stay on the couch on my account. The two of you could stay in there together.
JERRY No that's not such a good idea.
HELEN Well I tought that...
JERRY Not now. She's right inside.
HELEN What happened?
JERRY I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple.
HELEN What does that mean?
JERRY Well...
MORTY Why are you whispering?
JERRY Shh! Nothing, nothing.
HELEN Elaine...
MORTY What about her?
JERRY ...but you know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just goes to show you. You never know what... huh you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. It could just take right off at any time. We've tried all kind of arrangments, but we can't seem to be friend when we sleep together.
MORTY Why do you need more friends? You've got plenty of friends.
HELEN He's an idealist.
MORTY What the hell are you looking for?
JERRY I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking.
HELEN He likes looking.
MORTY So look.
HELEN But how long can you look?
JERRY I'm going for the record.
HELEN You know your father wouldn't say so but he's really glad you came.
JERRY Oh, come on.
HELEN This is a big thing for him. Outgoing president of the condo association.
MORTY Aha!
DORIS So they arrived safely.
MORTY You remember Jack and Doris?
JERRY Nice to meet you. This is Elaine.
ELAINE Hi. Nice to meet you.
JACK So Jerry, you came all the way down here for this?
ELAINE And scuba diving.
HELEN Scuba diving? Who's going scuba diving?
JERRY We're going scuba diving. We'll be back in time.
HELEN What do you have to go scuba diving for?
JERRY For fun.
HELEN For fun?
MORTY Jack have some spong cake.
JACK No. thanks, no.
MORTY Jack is emceeing tomorrow. He's in charge of the whole thing.
JACK So Jerry, your mother told me you're gonna do one your little comedy skit tommsorow?
JERRY I don't think so.
JACK No? Listen Morty you wanna settle up for last night? All right. I owe you 19.45$ .
MORTY What did you have? You had the minute steak?
JACK Yeah.
MORTY Did you have a coke or what?
JACK I did not have a coke.
MORTY Somebody had a coke.
HELEN Oh I had a coke.
DORIS And I had the scampi.
JACK So that's 17.10$ and the tax and the tip.
MORTY All right. Make it 20 bucks.
JACK It's: 19.45$, Morty.
MORTY 19.45$ ?
JACK See? You know your father. He can't get a write to the penny, but that's why he was such a good president.
JERRY What kind of pen is that?
JACK This pen?
JERRY Yeah.
JACK This is an astronaut pen. It writes upside down. They use this in space.
JERRY Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you get it?
JACK Oh it was a gift.
JERRY Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen works.
JACK Take the pen.
JERRY Oh no.
JACK Go ahead.
JERRY I couldn't
JACK Come on, take the pen!
JERRY I can't take it.
JACK Do me a personal favor!
JERRY No, I'm not...
JACK Take the pen!
JERRY I cannot take it!
JACK Take the pen!
JERRY Are you sure?
JACK Positive! Take the pen!
JERRY O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee, boy!
HELEN Jack, what are you doing?
JACK Stop it!
DORIS Jack, we should go. It was nice to meeting you.
ELAINE Mmm, nice to meet you.
JERRY Thanks again.
JACK Come on!
DORIS She's adorable.
HELEN What did you take his pen for?
JERRY What he gave it to me.
HELEN You didn't have to take it.
MORTY Oh my God! She's gotta make a big deal out of everything.
JERRY He offered it to me.
HELEN Because you made such a big fuss about it.
JERRY I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?
HELEN You shouldn't have said anything. What did you expect him to do?
JERRY He could have said: "Thank you, I like it too" and put it back in his pocket.
HELEN He loves that pen.
MORTY Oh come on!
HELEN He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use it.
JERRY If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.
HELEN He didn't think you'd accpet.
JERRY Well, he was wrong.
HELEN I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. She'll tell everyone in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. They're talking about it right now.
JERRY So you want me to return it?
HELEN Yes.
MORTY He's not gonna return the pen. That's ridiculous.
JERRY Hey I don't even want the pen now!
MORTY Jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money. Believe me. He gives me a check for 19.45. He didn't have a Coke. Ho, ho, ho!
ELAINE Here, let me see it. Hey, it wrtites upside down.
ELAINE Come in.
JERRY Are you O.K. in here?
ELAINE Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this?
JERRY It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. It's one day, really.
ELAINE Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing me.
JERRY Oh you wanna switch? I'm sleeping on a love seat. I've got my feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule.
ELAINE I am never gonna fall asleep.
JERRY Oh, don't say that. You'll jinx me.
ELAINE How can they not put the air conditioning on?
JERRY They're nuts with temperature.
ELAINE This bar is right in my back! It's making a dent.
JERRY How about that guy writing a check for 19.45?
ELAINE I'm sweating here. I'm in bed, sweating.
JERRY It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that.
MORTY Stay on 95 South to Biscayne Boulevard. Then you make a left turn. Put you blinker on immediatly, there's an abutment there. Then you're gonna merge over very quickly, but stay on Biscayne. Don't get off Biscayne. You understand me?
JERRY Stay on Biscayne.
HELEN You're going underwater?
JERRY Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done.
HELEN What do you have to go underwater for? What's down there that's so special?
JERRY What's so special up here?
ELAINE Oh!
HELEN What's the matter?
ELAINE My back.
HELEN What happened?
ELAINE That... That bed. The bar was right in my back.
HELEN I told you to let us sleep in there.
JERRY Then you would be hunched over.
ELAINE I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.
JERRY You can't go?
HELEN So stay home.
ELAINE You can go.
JERRY Without you? That's the whole reason you came down here.
HELEN Don't go.
JERRY You sure?
MORTY Maybe you should see a doctor.
JERRY We'll stay in a hotel tonight.
ELAINE Yes!
HELEN No, we'll stay in there.
JERRY Why don't you get a new sofa?
MORTY Nobody uses it.
JERRY I'm buying you a new sofa.
HELEN Oh Jerry, don't talk crazy.
ELAINE Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner on.
HELEN You're hot?
ELAINE I've lost 6 pounds.
HELEN I don't even know how to work it.
MORTY I keep telling her it's like an oven in here.
EVELYN Is everybody up?
JERRY Hi. How are you?
EVELYN Hello Jerry.
JERRY Evelyn, this is Elaine.
ELAINE Hi Evelyn.
EVELYN Jerry you got thin.
JERRY Too thin?
HELEN Oh stop worrying so much about how you look.
EVELYN So where's the new pen?
JERRY What?
EVELYN The pen. The one Jack Klompus gave you.
HELEN How did you know that?
EVELYN Blanche told me.
HELEN Blanche?
EVELYN That's some good pen. It writes upside down.
ELAINE The astronauts use them.
HELEN What did Blanche say?
EVELYN I don't know. She said Jerry wanted the pen.
JERRY I never really wanted the pen.
MORTY He gave him the pen.
HELEN Morty.
EVELYN Why you don't like the pen?
JERRY No, no, I...
EVELYN Cause if you don't like it, give it back to him.
HELEN Is that what she said?
EVELYN Who?
HELEN Blanche.
EVELYN What are you talking about?
HELEN Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldn't do that. Jack gave it to him. All he said was he liked it. I mean nobody put a gun to his head. You're giving him back that pen.
ELAINE Somebody please-- the air conditioner!
MORTY Oh! I forgot all about it.
JERRY All I said was "I like the pen".
MORTY How the hell do you work this thing?
HELEN Maybe you shouldn't go tonight.
ELAINE No no, I wanna go.
HELEN But your back hurts.
MORTY Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help.
ELAINE Oh, oh, O.K. You can turn down the air conditioning if you want.
HELEN No. I'm fine.
ELAINE You're not too cold?
HELEN No.
JERRY Don't be alarmed.
MORTY Oh my God! What the hell happened to you?
JERRY I'm O.K. My capillaries burst.
HELEN Your capillaries? Do you know what you look like?
JERRY How are you doing?
ELAINE Having a good time!
JERRY Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?
HELEN What happened to your eyes?
JERRY Well I started to go under...
HELEN With the instructor?
JERRY Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets.
HELEN I told you...
JACK Excuse me. Doris would like to borrow red your pocketbook to go with her shoes. The shoes have to match the pocketbook. What's she doing? Yoga?
ELAINE My back hurts.
JACK Morty you gotta hurry up. Get ready.
MORTY We got plenty of time.
JACK What happened to you?
JERRY I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.
HELEN It's from scuba diving.
JACK What's there to see underwater?
JERRY Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it.
JACK You what?
JERRY I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it.
JACK Well I mean...
JERRY Take it.
JACK All right!
MORTY You know Jack, you've got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's pen.
JACK Whose pen?
MORTY His pen.
JACK This happens to be my pen.
MORTY You didn't give it to him.
JACK What are you talking about? He pratically begged me for it.
MORTY Where do you come off with this crap?
JACK Listen, do you think I take everything everybody offers me? You offered me sponge cake yesterday. Did I take it?
MORTY You said you didn't want it!
JACK Of course I wanted it! I love sponge cake!
MORTY Then who the hell said you couldn't have any? I mean what the hell do I care whether you have sponge cake?
JACK Because I saw the look on your face last week when I took the scotch tape!
MORTY Ahh! Ahh! So you got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over for it!
JACK Don't worry about it! I'll give it back!
MORTY I don't want it!
JACK I don't want it!
MORTY You know Jack, do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch tape, and get the hell out of here!
JACK Listen do you think I give a damn?
MORTY Aah! The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. Well that'it for them.
JERRY What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?
HELEN I have no use for either one of them. I don't even want them there tonight.
JERRY Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?
MORTY yeah, he's supposed to be the emcee.
JERRY Well. This should be a very interesting evening.
ELAINE Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?
PHOTOGRAPHER Say astronaut.
ELAINE Say what? Say what?
JERRY You took too many of those pills.
MORTY Astronaut?
HELEN Say it.
ELAINE Astro...naut!
MORTY Good. O.K. What about last year when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you?
JERRY Oh God.
JERRY Uncle Leo.
LEO Hello!
STELLA Morty are you nervous?
MORTY What nervous?
LEO What's with the sunglasses? Who are you? Van Johnson?
JERRY I've got a black eye.
STELLA Hello.
JERRY Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.
HELEN Stella! Stella!
JERRY Her back hurts.
STELLA Humm... We saw you on "The Tonight Show" last week.
LEO I thought Johnny was very rude to you. He didn't even let you talk.
JERRY No, no.
LEO You need some new material. I've heard you do that dog routine three times already.
ELAINE Stella! Stella!
LEO Listen, you should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material for you.
MORTY What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department!
LEO You should read the letters he's written. He's funnier than the whole bunch of you! Oh, here's Jack. We should sit down.
STELLA This better be good. I'm missing "Golden Girls" for this.
HELEN I hate her like poison.
JACK Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every year, Phase Two of the Pines of Mark Gables honors the previous year president. And this year we are honoring Morty Seinfeld A man who slept more hours on the job than Ronald Reagan.
MORTY Slept on the job?
JACK Being president of the condo is not easy. It requires hard work, dedication, and commitment, and unfortunately he possesses none of these qualities.
HELEN He's joking.
JACK His administration did excel in one department: the hiring of incompetents.
MORTY That's what you say.
JACK But we do owe him a debt of gratitude because by not fixing the crack in the sidewalk, he put Mrs Ziven out of commission for a few weeks.
MORTY Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about that!
JERRY Dad!
MORTY He gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back. Tell them about that!
JACK He gave it to me!
MORTY Come on. That's enough, sit down!
JACK I'm not sitting down!
JACK Ow! You broke my dental plate! Doris! He broke my dental plate. You son-of-a-bitch! I'm gonna sue you.
HELEN Jerry, do your act.
JERRY I can't. Nobody's even listening.
HELEN They're all gonna leave.
JERRY Oh God! huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight?
MAN_IN_THE_CROWD Who are you?
JERRY Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes?
WOMAN_IN_THE_CROWD Not my Harry. He flies first class.
JERRY Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut?
MAN_IN_THE_CROWD I'd rather have a bottle of scotch!
HELEN Do the dog routine.
JERRY All I said was I liked the pen!
ELAINE Stella!
CHIROPRACTOR You could aggravated. I wouldn't go anywhere for at least five days.
ELAINE Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?
JERRY There must be some mistake.
CHIROPRACTOR I'm afraid not.
ELAINE Five days. Here.
HELEN So we have you for five more days!
JERRY Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be...
ELAINE Excuse me?
JERRY Nothing.
EVELYN Good morning.
JERRY Hi Evelyn.
EVELYN Has Morty decided on a lawyer yet?
HELEN I don't think so.
EVELYN Because my nephew Larry could do it. He's a brilliant lawyer. He says Jack has no case.
HELEN I'll ask him when he gets up.
EVELYN Oh, and I spoke to Arnold. And he says that according to the bylaws of the condo constitution, they need six votes to throw you out for unruly behavior. Not five. Doctor Chernov is the one you'll have to suck up to.
MORTY Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's that bar. Who the hell could sleep on that thing?
HELEN I was very comfortable.
EVELYN Morty, Arnold says they need six votes to throw you out.
HELEN It's in the constitution.
MORTY Who are you?
CHIROPRACTOR I'm a chiropractor.
MORTY What are you kidding me?
ELAINE Five more days?
JERRY Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that.
JERRY She hasn't told her father yet?
GEORGE No. We're supposed to tell him tonight.
JERRY "We're"? What do you mean, "We're"?
GEORGE Susan wants me to be there.
JERRY You're meetin' the father for the first time?
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY Well, you'll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down.
GEORGE I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!
JERRY I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it: Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars..
GEORGE Yeah, I know what happened.
JERRY No, but wait, wait: And then you dump them off onto Kramer..
GEORGE I know.
JERRY ..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars! It's very comical..
GEORGE Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a lot on my mind.
JERRY No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day.
GEORGE I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the worst he could do? So you burn a cabin down..
JERRY C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a cabin.
GEORGE We could build a cabin like that.
JERRY Well, maybe not us, but two men could.
GEORGE Bics? What, d'ja get, bics?
JERRY What, you got a problem with the pen now?
GEORGE Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.
JERRY Alright, let's just get to work. NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I, Scene A.
GEORGE So, you're gonna sit there?
JERRY Just - just park yourself. Alright. Act I, Scene A.
GEORGE Drink?
JERRY No, no thank you.
GEORGE Alright, here we go.
JERRY Act I, Scene A..
GEORGE Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?
JERRY Yes. Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh, yeah. I can hold. Every time I call I gotta chit-chat with her assistant for, like, twenty minutes. Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen, I'm at a pay phone, and there's lots of people here waiting to use it. I'll be off in a minute! Yeah, could you just put me through to Elaine? Okay, thanks! Are you thinking of ideas? Listen, Elaine, is there any way I could get through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear for, like, twenty minutes. So we're on for later?
ELAINE Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil thing happenin' here.. Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go. Sandra! Sandra? Hi, can you come here for a second?
JERRY Okay, let's go.
GEORGE Alright, here we go. You got it?
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE Here we go.
JERRY Okay, how about this: I'm in my apartment, you come in.
GEORGE It's beautiful. Now, what do I say?
ELAINE Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could you not talk to them for too long?
SANDRA Why? Did Jerry say something?
ELAINE No, no.
SANDRA He must have said something.
ELAINE Oh, no, he didn't say anything.
SANDRA I can't work for you! I can't. I'm leaving.
ELAINE No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a stand-up comedian! Sometimes they don't laugh!
GEORGE Alright, let's go.
JERRY Here we go.
KRAMER Hey.
GEORGE yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work..
JERRY Yeah, come on. What's with you?
KRAMER No more golf.
JERRY Why?
KRAMER Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every time I give him a couple of those Cuban cigars?
JERRY Yeah.
KRAMER Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire! Hey, George, maybe you can ask Susan's father for more, huh?
GEORGE What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin!
KRAMER Why? What's one thing got to do with another?
GEORGE Kramer, please.
KRAMER Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it, they don't rake the sand traps! Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with!
GEORGE Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else.
KRAMER Where? They're Cubans.
GEORGE You know what? Maybe I should take off.
JERRY What?!
GEORGE Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want to leave myself plenty of time.
JERRY You got four hours! What about the script?
GEORGE I think we got a bite on it.
MRS._ROSS Doesn't George look like your sister, Sarah?
MR._ROSS A slight resemblance.
MRS._ROSS Her son's a podiatrist, you know.
GEORGE Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean..
MR._ROSS How are you enjoying those cigars I gave you?
GEORGE Oh, uh, the cigars.. I'm, uh, suckin' 'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.
MR._ROSS You know those cigars are made special for Castro?
GEORGE I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild.
MR._ROSS What?
SUSAN He's doing Johnny Carson, daddy.
MR._ROSS I didn't care much for his jokes.
SUSAN Daddy never laughs.
GEORGE Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going "Ha, ha!"? What is that? "Ha, ha!"?
MR._ROSS You know, you can't get those cigars anywhere.
MRS._ROSS You and your cigars..
MR._ROSS Wear some more lipstick.
SUSAN Daddy, there's, um, there's something that we have to talk to you about..
MR._ROSS Oh, I forgot to ask you - how'd you like the cabin?
GEORGE Oh, the, uh, the cabin.. well,
JERRY Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm responsible for this woman's quitting. Oh, this is unbelievable!
ELAINE I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?
JERRY Ohh.. dial the number. How could you do this?
ELAINE I was just trying to help you.
JERRY Oh, just trying to help me.. Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld. Listen, I - I just want to tell you, "Yeah, it was a real treat talking to her on the phone." You know, but I was really being sincere.. No, of course I like you.. Tonight? ..Um, uh, hold on a second. Now she wants to have a drink with me. Yeah, I think I can.. Um.. yeah, I know where that is.. Ok.. uh, I'll see you there. Okay, bye. Now I gotta have a drink with her.
GEORGE The cabin.. Well.. Susan?
SUSAN Uhh.. about the cabin..
MR._ROSS I love that place. My father built that cabin in 1947. My mother was recuperating from Impetigo at the time, and dad thought it would be a good idea to get her out into the fresh air. She died there the following winter. And he passed away 10 years later to the day. His last words to me were, "Cherish the cabin." Not, uh, "Take care of your sister." She's a paraplegic. But, "Cherish the cabin." And I have.. for 45 years. It's often been a.. sanctuary for me.
GEORGE Kinda like Superman's fortress of solitude.
MR._ROSS What?
GEORGE S, uh, Superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it all..
MR._ROSS When I go, I'm passing it on to her.
MRS._ROSS I'll take a hotel any day.
SUSAN Daddy..
MR._ROSS Yes?
SUSAN Daddy, about the cabin..
MRS._ROSS Look, Henry, I spilled wine on me!
MR._ROSS What about it?
SUSAN Well, the thing is..
MR._ROSS What? What is it?
SUSAN Well, the - the cabin, is, kind of, uh.. George?
GEORGE Burned.
MR._ROSS Burned?
SUSAN There was a fire, and it uh..
GEORGE Burned.
MR._ROSS The cabin burned?
GEORGE yeah, burned. Whoo..
MRS._ROSS Burned!
MR._ROSS Was anything found? Was it all burned to the ground?! Did they find anything?
SUSAN No. Nothing.
MRS._ROSS Nothing! Ha, ha, ha.
GEORGE Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's really rather ironic - one might even say, in a sense, comical.. Really. Think about it.
SANDRA I can't believe you said that!
JERRY What?!
SANDRA How could you say something like that to me?!
JERRY What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up!
SANDRA That was a weird thing to say.
JERRY Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.
SANDRA Ohh, I think you're really sick.
JERRY I'm not sick. You - you said much sicker things than me.
SANDRA I'm leaving.
JERRY I really think you're making too much of this.
SANDRA Excuse me.
JERRY Let me walk you to a cab.
SANDRA That's ok.
JERRY I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be the end of it.
SANDRA Oh, really?
JERRY I mean, people - they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't.
JERRY So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she starts rubbing my leg.
GEORGE Wo-hoah! What did you do?
JERRY Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?
GEORGE Yeah, right.
JERRY I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the hand, and I'm thinking, "That hand should not be on my leg." But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words, "Would you mind?!"
GEORGE Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that?
JERRY I don't know, they're working on a whole other level..
GEORGE Alright, so, go ahead.
JERRY So we go back to my apartment..
GEORGE Woah. Whoa! Woah!
JERRY So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting a little passionate.. and, uh, she starts with the dirty talking.
GEORGE Alright, alright, hold on! Time out! Woah, woah! What did she say?
JERRY Oh, you know, the usual..
GEORGE No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?
JERRY Typical things.
GEORGE What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme some typical.
JERRY She says, uh..
GEORGE That's very dirty. That's absolutely filthy.
JERRY ..And then she starts talking about her panties.
GEORGE Gonna need some water here!
JERRY So I said something.
GEORGE Ok, what did you say?
JERRY Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up.
GEORGE Of course.
JERRY Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I said, "You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?"
GEORGE "The panties your mother laid out for you"? What does that mean?
JERRY I don't know! It just popped out.
GEORGE Well, how did she react?
JERRY She flipped out! Just left.
GEORGE Well, that's not offensive. It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.
JERRY Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me hear the end of it. GEORGE; Well, what if this girl says something?
JERRY She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her into it - how stupid was that? Hey, so, Susan's father took that news pretty hard, huh?
GEORGE Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing.
JERRY I guess he failed to see the humor in it.
GEORGE Huh. C'mon, let's go, go. We got a lot of work to do today.
JERRY Alright, big work day.
GEORGE That's right.
GEORGE Okay.
JERRY Let's go.
GEORGE Here we are.
JERRY Right now.
GEORGE Let's do it.
JERRY You and me.
GEORGE Okay.
JERRY Alright.
GEORGE What'dya got?
JERRY I got: You enter, you go "Hi", and I go, "Hello." Now.. we need something here..
KRAMER Oh, hey. Oh, you guys are working? I'll come back. No, you guys should get back to work.
GEORGE Don't be silly.
JERRY Come in, we're taking a break.
KRAMER Oh, yeah?
JERRY Yeah!
KRAMER Uh, George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some more cigars?
GEORGE No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that.
KRAMER Okay.. well, I guess I'm just going to have to take matters into my own hands, huh? Alright, I'll see you guys.
KRAMER Buenos dias.
SECRETARY Buenos dias.
KRAMER Uh, habla ingles?
SECRETARY Si.
KRAMER Giddy-up. Ok, uh, Um. I need to talk to someone.
SECRETARY What is this about?
KRAMER Uh, well, It's a very private matter, but it's extremely urgent.
SECRETARY Are you an American?
KRAMER Oh, yeah.
SECRETARY I see.. excuse me.
KRAMER Okay.
JERRY Alright, let's get going. C'mon, c'mon now. C'mon, let's get it together.. Yeah?
ELAINE It's Elaine.
JERRY C'mon up.
GEORGE Alright, you know what we should do? We should go to the movies. Get away from this script for a while..
JERRY Yeah, we should.
GEORGE Alright, I just have to go over to the Ross' apartment and drop off Susan's sunglasses. You'll come with me?
JERRY Yeah. Wha - what, does she live with them?
GEORGE No, no, no, no.
JERRY Oh.
ELAINE Hey, nice going, Jerome Seinfeld!
JERRY What?
ELAINE I just got a message from Sandra, she's coming back to work.
JERRY Well, then, you've just got to fire her! Don't even think about it - there's no two ways about it.
ELAINE Why? What happened? Did you talk?
JERRY Talk? Did I talk? It - you're darn right I talk to her! We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks that this isn't anybody you should be talking to.
ELAINE Really?
JERRY Yes.
ELAINE Really? You really think I should fire her?
JERRY Oh yeah. Yeah, in fact, if George and I weren't so busy here working on the script, I'd do it myself.
MAN Expira te afuera.
KRAMER Buenos dias.
MAN What is your name, Senor?
KRAMER Uh, Kramer.
MAN So, Senor Kramer, what is this about?
KRAMER Cigars.
MAN Cigars?
KRAMER Cigars.
MAN What about cigars?
KRAMER Uh, see here, I.. I saved one of the cigar rings..
MAN Ohh.. You mean - one of these..
KRAMER Yeah, yeah. That- that's, uh, okay, So, uh, I'd like to buy a couple of boxes of those from you, yeah?
MAN You do realize, of course, these are illegal in your country.
KRAMER Um, wha - oh, illegal, huh?
MAN I like that jacket..
SUSAN Hi!
GEORGE Hi, how are ya?
SUSAN Hey, Jerry.
JERRY Hi.
SUSAN I thought you two guys were working today.
JERRY Ah, just - takin' a little break.
GEORGE yeah. Uh, oh, here's your sunglasses.
SUSAN Ok, thanks. Come on in for a second. This is my brother, Ricky. He's home from college for the weekend.
GEORGE Ohh, hey there, young fella. What's your major?
RICKY I don't have one.
GEORGE Well, you should always consider podiatry. There's nothing wrong with the feet.
SUSAN And this is my Aunt, Sara.
SARA He doesn't look like me.
MRS._ROSS Sara, what do you have on your wheels?
SARA Nothing, they're clean.
MRS._ROSS Ricky, did you wipe her wheels off?
RICKY Yes.
MRS._ROSS Well, they're filthy. It's just a matter of common courtesy.. When you come in the house you wipe your wheels.
SUSAN Excuse me. Hello, Raymond.
RAYMOND Ah, yes, the man from the insurance company dropped this off this morning. He said it was the only thing left from the remains of the fire.
SUSAN Oh, thank you. Wow, I've never seen this before.. Oh, they're letters. Here.
GEORGE Oh, sure.
SUSAN From.. from John Cheever.
JERRY_AND_GEORGE Oh, wow.
SUSAN "Dear Henry, last night with you was bliss. I fear my.. orgasm has left me a cripple. I don't how how I shall ever get back to work.. I love you madly, John. P.S. Loved the cabin."
GEORGE Well, we.. we, we, ah..
JERRY Yeah..
GEORGE We really should be, uh, heading out..
JERRY Yeah. Look at the time.
GEORGE You know, the time..
MR._ROSS The box! My letters! Gimme that! Who told you to open this?!
MRS._ROSS Who's John?! Who's John?!
SARA I knew it!
MRS._ROSS I want to know who John is!
RICKY John Cheever?! Dad, you and John Cheever?!
MR._ROSS Yes! Yes, he was the most wonderful person I've ever known. And I love him deeply! In a way you could never understand..
GEORGE Well, we really should be-
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE Uh, heading out. Jerry really hates to miss the coming attractions.
JERRY Yeah, and, because of the.. time.
GEORGE yeah, time is what he's indicating there..
JERRY We'll see ya.
GEORGE Uh, anyway, onward and upward.
GEORGE Alright, here we go.
JERRY Alright, let's go.
GEORGE Come on now.
JERRY Right now.
GEORGE Here we go.
JERRY You and me.
GEORGE You got it.
JERRY No foolin'
GEORGE Ok, so, what'dya got?
JERRY Alright, I got, uh, you come in, you say "Hi", and I say "Hello".
GEORGE Alright, so, we need something..
JERRY Yeah.. how about this: I say "How's it goin'?"
GEORGE "How's it going?" - beautiful. Oh, come on, we were just on a roll now..
JERRY Alright, did you get that line?
GEORGE "How's it going?"
JERRY Did you write it down?
GEORGE I'm writin' it. "How's it going?"
JERRY Okay..
ELAINE Real good!
JERRY What?!
ELAINE Do you know how much money you cost me today?! 429 dollars!
JERRY What?! How?
ELAINE I got Sandra transferred to another office upstairs, okay?! So, she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe!
JERRY What calls?!
ELAINE Uh! I made a friend when I was in Europe, okay?! And we've been in touch, and Sandra told Lippman!
JERRY Oh, did - did she say anything else to you?
ELAINE "Anything else"? What do you mean "anything else"?
JERRY So she just left the office - didn't say a word to you about anything?
ELAINE Yeah!
JERRY Beautiful.
ELAINE Why is that beautiful?
JERRY Oh, no, not beautiful.
ELAINE It's four hundred and twenty nine dollars!
JERRY Hey, look, I'm going to pay for that.
ELAINE No, no.
JERRY No, I insist. I was the one who encouraged you to fire her - the whole thing was all my-
ELAINE Okay.
JERRY fault. Do you smell smoke?
KRAMER Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you to meet my new friends, here. This is, uh, Louis, Jorge, and Umberto.
JERRY Oh, how you doing? Nice to meet you.
KRAMER Yeah, we're heading up to Westchester - gonna hit the links.
JERRY Oh. Isn't that, uh, your..
KRAMER Oh, yeah, yeah, Okay, we're going. Vamanos, muchachos!
ELAINE Hey, what are you reading?
GEORGE Oh, uh, "The Falconer" by John Cheever. It's really excellent.
ELAINE John Cheever, you ever read any of his stuff?
JERRY Uh, yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing. Alright, look, we gotta get back to work. We just had a big breakthrough here.
ELAINE Ok, I'll leave you two alone.
JERRY Okay.
ELAINE Maybe I'll go visit my mother. She just bought me some new panties and they're - all laid out for me.
JERRY The love seat, that's a nice little item, there...I guess some guy thought, 'Well, if we can't get them to sit closer to us, why not just shorten the furniture?' My other favorite furniture brand is the La-Z-Boy. This is very flattering to the prospective customer, isn't it? Why don't we just call it the 'half-conscious deadbeat with no job, home all day, eating Cheetos and watching TV' recliner? I mean, it goes back so far, that thing...I mean, it's like, 'Go to bed already! It's over! You're wiped!'
JERRY So, she got you to join a book club?
GEORGE I got a feeling I'm gonna be much smarter than you pretty soon.
JERRY Well, I think that statement alone reflects your burgeoning intelligence. Hey, what about this one?
GEORGE Nah, I don't like that one.
JERRY So, what's your first book?
GEORGE "Breakfast At Tiffany's." 90 pages.
JERRY It's kinda old, isn't it?
GEORGE They wanted to read a Truman Capote book.
JERRY Oh, sure...Truman Capote.
GEORGE He's a great writer.
JERRY Oh, yeah.
GEORGE Did you ever read anything by him?
JERRY No. You?
GEORGE Nah.
JERRY Oh, what about this one? Look at this, this is it! This is what I'm looking for. Oh, yeah!
ELAINE Hey, what's going on?
JERRY New couch, baby!
ELAINE New couch? Why?
JERRY I love this couch. You know what the best part about it is? It doesn't fold out, so no one can sleep over.
ELAINE Hello.
CARL Hello.
ELAINE Oh, let me get the door for you. Ooh, be careful!
JERRY Wait till you see it, it's perfect. The guy told me it's one of a kind, they stopped making it.
ELAINE What are you doing with your old couch?
JERRY Nothing, the moving guys are taking it. Why, you want it?
ELAINE Yeah, I'll take it.
JERRY Well, I'm sure that they can deliver it to your apartment.
ELAINE Yes, they can.
KRAMER Hey! Couch is comin.'
JERRY It's here!
KRAMER Alright! Yeah. You know, I'm excited about this, Jerry. In a way, I feel like I'm getting a new couch.
JERRY Yeah. So do I.
KRAMER Ooh! Remember Poppie?
JERRY Oh, you mean from Poppie's Restaurant?
KRAMER Yeah, yeah. Anyway, uh...we're going into business together. Remember that idea I had a few years ago about the pizza place where you make your own pizza?
JERRY Yeah.
ELAINE What was that again?
KRAMER It's a pizza place where you make your own pie! We give you the dough, the sauce, the cheese...you pound it, slap it, you flip it up into the air...you put your toppings on and you slide it into the oven! Sounds good, huh?
ELAINE Ooh, I can't wait to get me a fella and make mah own pie!
JERRY What made you resurrect that old idea?
KRAMER Well, I happened to be eating at Poppie's when I told him the "old" idea, and his eyes - waaaaaah! - just lit up. You know, he wants to back it.
ELAINE I heard Poppie's was good, let's go.
JERRY I'm not goin' there. Didn't he get busted by the Board of Health?
KRAMER That was in the past, Jerry. As it happens, New York Magazine just judged his kitchen to be one of the cleanest in the city. They got a duck there, you think you died and went to heaven.
ELAINE Ooh! I love duck. C'mon, c'mon!
KRAMER Yeah, but you gotta order it two days in advance. You know, I'm gonna call him, I'm gonna order the duck for you.
JERRY Oh, Kramer, I -
JERRY Right there, guys. That's perfect. Ah? Whatta ya think, Lainie?
ELAINE Well, I don't know. I'll have to sit on it.
JERRY Oh no, I don't want anyone sitting on it.
CARL Sign here.
ELAINE Excuse me, I was wondering if would it be possible if you could deliver the old couch to my apartment? It's not very far.
CARL Sure.
ELAINE 'Kay. You, uh...you got room in the truck for me?
CARL Yeah, I think we can squeeze you in.
ELAINE Oh, goody. Okay, well uh......I'll see you chumps later.
KRAMER Did you offer those guys a drink?
JERRY Uh, no. Should I have?
KRAMER What kind of a person are you?
JERRY I don't know.
GEORGE Okay. "Breakfast At Tiffany's."
ELAINE So, he puts the couch down, and just as he's about to leave he says, "Do you date moving men?"
JERRY Ah ha...
ELAINE You wanna know what I said?
JERRY I can't wait.
ELAINE "I do now."
JERRY Clever.
ELAINE Is that something?
JERRY Yes.
ELAINE Is that something?
JERRY You're something. So anyway, when they were in my house before, I didn't offer them anything to drink.
ELAINE Well, they're real men, Jerry. They get sweaty.
JERRY So, anyone sweaty comes into your house has to be offered a drink?
ELAINE Yes.
JERRY Well, would you apologize for me?
POPPIE Hello! Jerry, so good to see you again!
JERRY Hello, Poppie. This is Elaine.
ELAINE Nice to meet you, Poppie.
POPPIE Let me show you to your table. Your duck is cooking as we speak. It is so succulent...so succulent!
JERRY Well, Kramer told us all about your business venture together.
POPPIE Your friend and I are going to make a lot of money. Of course, I already have a lot of money. Poppie does very well...very well.
ELAINE Well, your mother must be very proud of you.
POPPIE My mother...was taken from my house by the Communists in the middle of the night when I was ten years old. She was sent to a slave labor camp, where she labored for twelve years. Finally, they released her and she was on a boat to America to re-unite with us...but she was served some bad fish, and she died...on the high seas.
JERRY So, what's good tonight?
ELAINE Boy, I'm really looking forward to this duck. I've never had food ordered in advance before.
JERRY Ah, I could've stayed home and ordered a pizza from Paccino's.
ELAINE Paccino's? Oh no. You should never order pizza from Paccino's.
JERRY Why not?
ELAINE Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups.
JERRY So, you won't eat the pizza?
ELAINE No way.
JERRY Really.
ELAINE Yeah.
JERRY Well, what if Poppie felt the same way?
ELAINE Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then.
JERRY Really!
ELAINE Yeah. That's right.
JERRY Well, perhaps we should inquire. Poppie! Oh, Poppie. Could I have a word?
POPPIE Yes, Jerry. I just checked your duck...it is more succulent than even I had hoped.
JERRY Poppie, I was just curious...where do you stand on the abortion issue?
POPPIE When my mother was abducted by the Communists, she was with child...
JERRY Oh, boy.
POPPIE ...but the Communists, they put an end to that! So, on this issue there is no debate! And no intelligent person can think differently.
ELAINE Well...Poppie. I think differently.
POPPIE And what gives you the right to do that?
ELAINE The Supreme Court gives me the right to do that! Let's go Jerry, c'mon.
WOMAN_AT_NEXT_TABLE I heard that. Let's go, Henry.
HENRY But we just got here...
ELAINE And I am not coming back!
POPPIE You're not welcome!
JERRY Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up.
JERRY Well, you should have seen it. It was quite a scene over there.
GEORGE I'm sorry I missed it.
JERRY Oh, you really missed something. And I have to say...it was pretty much all my fault. So, how's the book coming? I say, how's the book comin'?
GEORGE Oh...pretty good.
JERRY So, what's it about?
GEORGE Well, it's about Holly Go-Lightly.
JERRY Holly Go-Lightly.
GEORGE Yeah, she's quite a character.
JERRY Yes, you haven't read a page, have you?
GEORGE No.
JERRY Big surprise.
GEORGE I couldn't. You know, if it's not about sports, I find it very hard to concentrate.
JERRY You're not very bright, are you?
GEORGE No, I'm not. I would like to be, but I'm not. What am I gonna do? The book club meets in a few days.
JERRY Why don't you rent the movie?
GEORGE 'Why don't I rent the movie.' See, this is when I like you. Alright, now I'm relieved.
KRAMER So...how was the dinner last night?
JERRY Oh...well...
KRAMER Did you enjoy the duck? Oh, Elaine! I was just asking how dinner went last night.
ELAINE Oh...well...
KRAMER Alright, what did you do to Poppie?
ELAINE Nothing.
KRAMER Well, he's in the hospital. And the cook says you put him there.
ELAINE What's wrong with him?
KRAMER I don't know! I'm gonna go and visit him later. It would be nice if you got him something.
JERRY We should get him something.
ELAINE Yeah. You're right.
ELAINE Do you know that I have been using the same bottle of shampoo for a year? And I shampoo every day. So, what do you think of my conversation?
CARL Not much! I, uh, would have invited you up, but I don't have any furniture.
ELAINE You don't have any furniture?
CARL No, I hate furniture. I can't look at it.
ELAINE Well, I can understand that. Pretty good date, huh?
CARL Yeah! No heavy lifting.
KRAMER Anyway, Jerry and Elaine felt very badly about what happened to you, and they wanted you to have this.
POPPIE What's this? A bottle of wine and a five-alarm chili? They're trying to kill Poppie?!
KRAMER Why, what...?
POPPIE Don't they know I have a gastro-intestinal disorder? If I would have any of this, I would die. Then Poppie's no good to anyone! This is a sick, sick joke on Poppie. How could you be friends with those two?
KRAMER Well, we're not very close.
POPPIE They owe me for those ducks. They were flown in from Newfoundland.
KRAMER Oh, they got good ducks there, huh?
POPPIE Oh, very good ducks.
ELAINE I'm in looove!
JERRY Whoa!
ELAINE This is it, Jerry! This is it! He is such an incredible person! He's real, he's honest, he's unpretentious...oh, I'm really lucky!
JERRY Did you tell him I was sorry I didn't offer him the drink?
ELAINE No, I forgot. And, the best part is, he doesn't play games. You know? There are no games!
JERRY No games? What is the point of dating without games? How do you know if you're winning or losing?
ELAINE Well, all I know is, he doesn't like games and he doesn't play games, you know? He has too much character and integrity.
JERRY Ah ha. And what is his stand on abortion?
ELAINE What?
JERRY What is his stand...on abortion?
ELAINE Well, I'm sure he's pro-choice.
JERRY How do you know?
ELAINE Because he, well...he's just so good-looking.
JERRY Well, you should probably ask, because if he's gonna be coming over with those Paccino's pizzas...could be trouble.
GEORGE I'd like to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's.
CLERK Uh, this is out. Someone has it.
GEORGE Out? Oh no, I've been to four other places, you're the only ones that have had it.
CLERK Well, I could put it on reserve for you, if you'd like.
GEORGE Maybe we could call them and ask them to return it.
CLERK Oh, sorry. We can't do that.
GEORGE Well, maybe they're done with it. I could go pick it up.
CLERK I don't think so. It doesn't work that way.
VOICE_ON_INTERCOM Yes?
GEORGE Uh, excuse me, are you Joe Temple?
INTERCOM Yes.
GEORGE Uh, yes, uh...you don't know me, my name is George Costanza...did you happen to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's?
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey, what's happenin.'
KRAMER Well, you know, Poppie's over at my place. Tonight's the big night. I'm gonna make the first test pizza at the restaurant.
JERRY You got a regular 'Manhattan Project' going on over there.
KRAMER Yeah. Anyway, he's about to leave, he wants the duck money.
JERRY Okay. Hi, Poppie.
POPPIE Hello.
JERRY I'm sorry about the gift, I didn't know about your condition.
POPPIE That's fine. If you just give me my duck money, I'll be on my way.
JERRY Okay. I'll get it.
KRAMER Why don't you sit down, Poppie? You're still recuperating. What, are you tired, Poppie?
POPPIE No.
KRAMER Hey, Poppie...you really think people wanna make their own pizza?
POPPIE Kramer, did I ever tell you about my mother? My mother -
JERRY Here you go. Anyway, I'm sorry again about the......the...the...
POPPIE The what?
JERRY ...the...the...
KRAMER So long. I'll see you tonight.
JERRY Kramer, Kramer, what is this?!
KRAMER What is what?
JERRY This puddle on my sofa!
KRAMER What puddle?
JERRY That puddle!
KRAMER I don't know.
JERRY Is it...? Could it...? Could he have...? It is! Poppie peed on my sofa!!
KRAMER Are you sure?
JERRY Well, what is it then?! My new sofa! Poppie peed on my new sofa!
KRAMER I'm sure it'll come out.
JERRY I don't care if it comes out, I can't sit on that anymore!
KRAMER Ah, you're making too much of it.
JERRY Yeah, you're right. It's just a natural human function...happens to be on my sofa, instead of in the toilet, where it would normally be.
KRAMER Right!
GEORGE Well, anyway, the book club meets tomorrow, Mr. Temple.
JOE Well, I was going to watch it with my daughter. She likes Audrey Hepburn very much.
GEORGE She was a delicate flower.
JOE Why didn't you just read the book?
GEORGE Well, as I say, the pink-eye made my vision...quite blurry...
JOE Remy, this is George. Would you mind if he watched Breakfast At Tiffany's with us?
CARL Hi.
ELAINE Hi.
CARL I missed you.
ELAINE Oh, I missed you!
CARL I don't remember the last time I felt this way.
ELAINE Me, either!
CARL I think about you all the time.
ELAINE You do?
CARL Do you think about me?
ELAINE Oh yeah, all the time, all the time...although, recently I've been thinking about this friend of mine.
CARL What friend?
ELAINE Oh, just this woman...she got impregnated by her troglodytic half-brother, and decided to have an abortion.
CARL You know, someday...we're going to get enough people in the Supreme Court to change that law.
GEORGE So, anything to uh, nosh?
JOE What did you want?
GEORGE Popcorn?
REMY Popcorn? Where do you think you are?
GEORGE Well, a lot of people keep popcorn in the house.
REMY Well, we don't.
GEORGE You might want to try it...makes the movie more enjoyable, that's all.
JOE Here's some nuts.
GEORGE Oh! Nuts! Excellent! You know what I love? How there's two nuts named after people. Hazel...and filbert.
REMY Can we watch the movie now, Daddy?
GEORGE Hey, let's turn off the lights, get some real 'movie atmosphere.'
JOE The lights are fine.
KRAMER See, anybody can do this.
POPPIE Use your wrist! It's all in the wrist. Not too high!
KRAMER Alright, put a little sauce on here... Some cheese...
POPPIE Not too much!
KRAMER And...cucumbers!
POPPIE Wait a second...what is that?
KRAMER It's cucumbers.
POPPIE No, no. You can't put cucumbers on a pizza.
KRAMER Well, why not? I like cucumbers.
POPPIE That's not a pizza. It'll taste terrible.
KRAMER But that's the idea, you make your own pie.
POPPIE Yes, but we cannot give the people the right to choose any topping they want! Now on this issue there can be no debate!
KRAMER What gives you the right to tell me how I would make my pie?
POPPIE Because it's a pizza!
KRAMER It's not a pizza until it comes out of the oven!
POPPIE It's a pizza the moment you put your fists in the dough!
KRAMER No, it isn't!
POPPIE Yes, it is!
JOE'S_WIFE I'm home.
JOE Hey, honey.
REMY Hi, Mom.
JOE'S_WIFE Hi, baby. Hello. Breakfast At Tiffany's?
JOE Yeah.
JOE'S_WIFE Well, I just came back from Angela's, it's not looking very good for Duncan.
JOE Aw, that's too bad.
JOE'S_WIFE Yeah, the doctor thinks it's just a matter of time -
GEORGE Joe...could you...
JOE'S_WIFE Poor guy, I hate to see him suffer like this...
GEORGE You know, I'm sorry, I...I hate to be one of those people, but we're right in the middle of this thing...I can't hear.
JOE'S_WIFE Who are you?
JOE This is George Costanza.
GEORGE This is very hard to follow with all the talking.
JOE I'll pause it, okay?
GEORGE Any more grape juice?
JOE'S_WIFE Who is this guy?
REMY He's in some book club.
JOE'S_WIFE And what's he doing here?
REMY Cheating on his test.
GEORGE So, we watching the movie, or are we still talking? Okay, c'mon. Let's go.
REMY What?
GEORGE C'mon, you took my seat.
REMY It's not your seat.
GEORGE I was sitting there, c'mon.
REMY You didn't save it.
GEORGE I had the arm! Joe...
JOE What's the difference?
GEORGE Well, I was very comfortable! I've got my nuts here...
REMY It's my couch.
GEORGE Alright, c'mon, scooch over.
REMY Look! Look what you did! You got grape juice all over our couch, you've ruined our couch!
GEORGE Joe...
ELAINE Oh my god.
JERRY You see?!
ELAINE So, you're gonna get a new couch?
JERRY Well, I guess I have no choice.
ELAINE Do you want your old couch back?
JERRY I was hoping you'd offer. Yeah?
INTERCOM It's the movers.
JERRY 'Kay.
ELAINE Who's that?
JERRY Your boyfriend, he's taking it out.
ELAINE No, no, he's not my boyfriend.
JERRY Why?
ELAINE Take a guess.
JERRY Oh, really.
ELAINE Hi.
CARL Hi.
JERRY Hey Carl, I also need you to go to Elaine's and bring my old couch back.
CARL Today?
JERRY Could you?
CARL Sure.
ELAINE What are you doing with this couch?
JERRY George is taking it.
ELAINE Did you tell him it was peed on?
JERRY He said he doesn't care, he'll just turn the cushion over.
CARL I'm sorry you feel that way, Elaine.
ELAINE Yeah, me too.
CARL It's just too bad.
ELAINE Yeah. It is.
CARL Well, I better get this couch back to Jerry's.
ELAINE Can I offer you anything to drink?
CARL Yeah, sure.
ELAINE All I've got is grape juice.
CARL Throw it!
CARL The couch!
MARIE She didn't want the constraints of any relationship, that's why she got rid of the cat. The most important thing in Holly's life was her independence.
GEORGE Well, not really. After all, she did get together with George Peppard. I mean, Fred.
MARIE George...Fred's gay.
JERRY A female orgasm is kinda like the bat cave. A very few people know where it is and if you're lucky enough to see it you probably don't know how you got there and you can't find you way back after you left.
JERRY So, what's her name?
GEORGE Karin.
JERRY Is she nice?
GEORGE Great.
JERRY So you like her?
GEORGE I think so.
JERRY You don't know?
GEORGE I can't tell anymore.
JERRY Well do you feel anything?
GEORGE Feel? What's that?
JERRY All right, let me ask you this: when she comes over, you're cleaning up a lot?
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY You're just straightening up or you're cleaning?
GEORGE Cleaning
JERRY You do the tub?
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY On your knees, Ajax, scrubbing, the whole deal?
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY Okay, I think you're in love!
GEORGE Tub is love?
JERRY Tub is love. So there you are. You've got a nice girl and a clean apartment.
GEORGE Yep. There's one little problem.
JERRY Sexual?
GEORGE Yeeeaaah. Well..... I've never really feld confident in..... one particular aspect.
JERRY Below the equator?
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY Nobody does. You know, nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort.
GEORGE I don't know. Last time I got the tap.
JERRY You got the tap?
GEORGE You know, you're going along, you think everything's all right and all of a sudden you get that tap. . You know it's like pfffff , all right that's enough, you're through.
JERRY The tap is tough.
GEORGE It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball.
JERRY Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business.
GEORGE No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that.
JERRY It's a very complicated area.
GEORGE You can go crazy trying to figure that place out.
JERRY It's a haaazy mystery.
GEORGE Anyway, I think everything else is okay. Unless of course she's faking.
ELAINE Who's faking?
GEORGE Nothing.
ELAINE Faking what?
GEORGE Nobody's faking.
ELAINE Ah! Orgasm?
GEORGE She's not faking!
ELAINE How do you know?
GEORGE I know. I can tell. It's one of my powers. Why, did you ever fake?
ELAINE Of course.
JERRY Really?
GEORGE You faked?
ELAINE On occasion.
JERRY And the guy never knows?
ELAINE No.
JERRY How can he not know that?
ELAINE Because I was gooood.
JERRY I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.
ELAINE You didn't know.
JERRY What?
ELAINE You didn't know.
JERRY Are you saying...
GEORGE I think I'll have a piece of cake.
JERRY With me?
ELAINE Well...
JERRY You faked with me?
ELAINE Yeah.
JERRY You faked with me?
ELAINE Yeah.
JERRY No.
ELAINE Yeah.
JERRY You faked it?
ELAINE I faked it.
JERRY That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?
ELAINE Not bad huh?
JERRY What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?
ELAINE Fake, fake, fake, fake.
JERRY I'm stunned, I'm shocked! How many times did you do this?
ELAINE Uuuhm, all the time.
JERRY All the time?!
GEORGE We got a chocolate malt in here!
JERRY But I'm so good.
GEORGE I'm sure you are.
ELAINE Jerry, listen, it wasn't you. I just didn't have 'em back then.
JERRY She faked.
JERRY Maybe they've all been faking.
ELAINE I'm sure they're not.
GEORGE Maybe Karin is faking.
KRAMER She was probably joking.
JERRY No no, it was no joke.
KRAMER She didn't have any?
JERRY No. None.
KRAMER She faked 'em all.
JERRY Faked 'em all.
KRAMER Well so she faked 'em, so what?
JERRY The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury.
KRAMER You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times.
JERRY How did she do it? She's like Meryl Streep this woman. And I had to work the equipment. I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union. If she'd at least told me, maybe I could have done something about it.
KRAMER Yeah I could have helped you out.
JERRY What could you have done?
KRAMER I could have given you some pointers. I know how to press those buttons body.
JERRY I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.
KRAMER Aaaaah.
JERRY Don't aaaaah! I'm supposed to do something with her later? I don't even think I wanna see her.
KRAMER Giddy-up.
JERRY Hello... Oh hello Elaine.
ELAINE So we're having dinner tonight?
JERRY I don't know, I'm not really in the mood.
ELAINE Why? What's wrong? You're not still thinking about this afternoon are you?
JERRY What, the grilled cheese? Naaah, they always burn the toast.
ELAINE Nooo, the other thing.
JERRY Oooh that. Well...
ELAINE Oh come on, Jerry. Making to much of a big deal about it.
JERRY Yeah I guess. So you wanna meet at that place at seven thirty?
ELAINE Okay.
JERRY All right.
ELAINE All right, see you later.
JERRY Bye.
ELAINE Bye.
ELAINE Rene, can you come here a second? Let me ask you something: have you ever... you know... faked it?
RENE Yeah, sometimes.
ELAINE Really, like when?
RENE Like if we went to a Broadway show, if we had really good seats.
ELAINE Yeah, well...
RENE Well you know, if it's enough all ready and I just wanna get some sleep.
JERRY I really don't feel like seeing her.
KRAMER You know, I faked it.
JERRY What?!
KRAMER Yeah.
JERRY You faked it? Why would you do that?
KRAMER Well you know, if it's enough already and I just wanna get some sleep.
JERRY Yeah, but why would you...
JERRY Bad peach?
KRAMER It's terrible!
JERRY Did you get that at Joe's?
KRAMER Yeah, of course I got it at Joe's.
JERRY That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best.
KRAMER You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna return this.
JERRY You're returning used fruit?
KRAMER Jerry this peach is sub par.
JOE So what do you want me to do?
KRAMER I want restitution.
JOE Restitution? You want restitution? Why should I give you restitution?
KRAMER Because it's no good.
JOE When you put that fruit out, that's where it ends for me.
KRAMER It's still your fruit, you gotta stand behind your fruit.
JOE I stand behind my fruit.
KRAMER So...
JOE Hey, you got a bad peach? That's an act of God. He makes the peaches. I don't make the peaches, I sell the peaches. You have a problem? You talk to him.
KRAMER You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go.
JOE Well let me put a solution for you: do your business elsewhere, I don't want your business.
KRAMER Oh now you don't want my business.
JOE No, I don't want your business and from this moment you're banned from the store, you're banned!
KRAMER But what am I gonna do for fruit?
GEORGE You seem like you really enjoyed your Risotto. You have a very contented air over there. You look very contented, very satisfied. Are you satisfied?
KARIN I'm very satisfied.
GEORGE I'm sure if you weren't satisfied you would probably say something wouldn't you?
KARIN I probably would. But then again I'm an enigma.
GEORGE Hey listen... instead of the movie... maybe we'll go back and... you know...
KARIN Maybe.
GEORGE So... you feel okay about that whole thing... what we do in there... generally okay with everything in there?
KARIN Generally.
GEORGE Do you feel the way you feel after the Risotto?
KARIN No, I feel full after the Risotto.
GEORGE Yeah... full. restaurant
JERRY Satisfied?
ELAINE Hey, you know what? You wanna go see that new Meryl Streep movie?
JERRY Meryl Streep?
ELAINE You don't like her?
JERRY Ah, she's okay.
ELAINE I love her Jerry, she's so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. There's no acting there.
JERRY Yeah. You don't want coffee or anything do you?
ELAINE I really admire actors, you know. It's just such an incredible skill.
JERRY Yeah, yeah, can we get off of this?
ELAINE What's the matter?
JERRY Nothing.
ELAINE You're not still thinking about that are you?
JERRY Nooo.
ELAINE Oh good.
JERRY Give me another shot!
ELAINE What?
JERRY Another shot, I want another shot.
ELAINE You mean...?
JERRY Yes!
ELAINE Oooh no, I don't think so.
JERRY Come on! One shot, I can do it, I know I can do it!
ELAINE Jerry, we're friends! We can't do that, it would ruin our friendship.
JERRY Oh friendship... friendship, shmanship .
ELAINE Jerry no, that's important to me.
JERRY We won't ruin the friendship.
ELAINE Yes we will!
JERRY Elaine...
ELAINE No Jerry, it is out of the question. You know what sex does to a friendship, it kills it.
JERRY A half hour, give me a half our.
ELAINE No!
JERRY Okay, fifteen minutes. I guarantee you fifteen minutes, I can make it happen!
ELAINE No!
JERRY You're worried I'll be able to do it aren't you?
ELAINE What, no, it doesn't matter. Jerry, I don't care.
JERRY That's it, that's it. You like having this over me, you don't want me to do it.
ELAINE That is so ridiculous.
JERRY Come on, Elaine!
ELAINE No.
JERRY Elaine?!
ELAINE No!
GEORGE It's Jerry's fault.
KARIN Jerry?
GEORGE Jerry and Elaine. They made me nuts.
KARIN Oh I don't care, George, really it's all right.
GEORGE So you feel okay?
KARIN Well, it's not like after the Risotto.
JERRY Well good night.
ELAINE I still don't understand why we had to walk out on that movie.
JERRY Oh that Meryl Streep, she's such a phony baloney.
ELAINE Goodnight. Thanks for a really fabulous evening .
JERRY Oh what, you're upset?
ELAINE Yes I'm upset, can't you tell?
JERRY No I can't, maybe you're faking.
ELAINE I'm really, really sorry I told you that.
JERRY I'm sorry too.
ELAINE Well stop being such a baby.
JERRY You're a baby!
ELAINE You're a baby!
GEORGE It's all your fault! You and Elaine! All that orgasm talk. She did have an orgasm, she didn't have an orgasm. Orgasm this, orgasm that. I got so focused on it. I started to panic and boom, I lost it. I tried everything, I was talking to him: 'Please wake up, do something.'
JERRY They're mysterious little fellows aren't they?
GEORGE I hate 'em!
JERRY You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens.
GEORGE It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation.
KRAMER Hey listen, if I give you money would you go out and get me some fruit?
JERRY Why can't you get it?
KRAMER Well I got banned from the store I can't go back in there now.
JERRY What happened?
KRAMER Well you know, we had a fight over the peach and... well Joe doesn't want my business.
GEORGE Hey, was that a joke about Houdini?
JERRY No. I told you not to say anything.
KRAMER Jerry, what am I gonna do for fruit?
JERRY Well you'll have to go to the supermarket.
KRAMER The supermarket? That's impossible! They don't have a decent piece of fruit at the supermarket. The apples are mealy, the oranges are dry. I don't know what's going on with the Papayas! Jerry you gotta go to Joe's, you gotta get me some fruit!
JERRY Oh so what I'm going to buy all your fruit now?
GEORGE Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?
JERRY Hello... Oh hi Patty, thanks for calling me back. I just wanted to ask you a question: when we we're going out did you have orgasms?... Okay, thanks... No that's it... Okay, bye.
JERRY Patty Lawrence had 'em!
KRAMER Okay, I'm gonna make you a fruit list, all right?
JERRY Yeah.
JERRY Hello Elaine? Patty Lorens had orgasms what do you think about that? And I got calls in to six other women and I bet you they confirm an orgasm too. So what do you have to say now Elaine?... Hello?
JERRY Why do I feel like I'm doing something wrong?
KRAMER All right now here's the list.
JERRY All this? It's too much. What do you need five mangos for?
KRAMER I like mangos.
JERRY Avocado? I don't know how to pick out an avocado.
KRAMER Well they gotta be soft.
JERRY How soft?
KRAMER Not too soft. Better too hard than too soft.
JERRY I'm not going through this every week, I tell you that right now. And what are these? Plums? What is that?
KRAMER Yeah now get the ones that are red on the inside.
JERRY Well how do I know what they look like on the inside? What do they look like on the outside?
KRAMER Oh! And get some plantains.
JERRY Plantains?
KRAMER Yeah.
JERRY What the hell is a plantain.
KRAMER It's part of the banana family. It's a delicacy.
JERRY You're not getting any plantains.
JERRY Hey Joe.
JOE How is it going?
JERRY Good, just getting some fruit for myself. Gotta have fruit in the house. I like it as a snack. Wholesome, natural, chock-full of vitamins. I don't know let's see... mangos... four plums with red on the inside... avocado... ooo, just right... and three plantains ought to do it.
JOE All right, all right, just hold it right there.
JERRY What?
JOE This fruit isn't for you.
JERRY What, what are you talking about?
JOE You think I don't know? Mangos, plantains, plums with the red on the inside, that's Kramer!
JERRY I can't buy mangos and plantains?
JOE All right, get out!
JERRY You're making a big mistake, Joe!
JOE I'll tell you something else: I don't what your business anymore either.
JERRY You're saying you're banning me from the store?
JOE That's exactly what I'm saying.
JERRY I'm banned?!
JOE You're banned.
GEORGE All right, where do you want it?
JERRY Put it over there.
KRAMER Yes! Oh look at this, these mangos are beautiful! Oh these are beautiful, you did good George.
GEORGE All right I gotta get going.
JERRY What are you doing?
GEORGE I got a date with Karin. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Nothing happening down there.
JERRY You're thinking about it too much. You're putting too much emphasis on it.
GEORGE I knew this was gonna happen some day. It was inevitable. I've known it ever since I was a little kid. I've been waiting for it.
KRAMER This mango is delicious!
GEORGE That reminds me, I'm not getting you guys any more fruit. That guy was eyeballing me the whole time. He gave me the creeps. All right, you owe me twenty-eight sixty.
JERRY Sorry, I don't have any cash.
KRAMER I only got hundreds.
GEORGE All right I knew it.
KRAMER Come on, come on, we're gonna pay you! Here have some mango.
GEORGE I don't want any mango.
KRAMER Come on, take some. It's good.
GEORGE Very good. Juicy. Ripe. This Joe's got some terrific fruit.
JERRY What?
GEORGE I feel like I got a B12 shot. This is like a taste explosion!
KRAMER I told you.
JERRY What is it?
GEORGE I think it moved. Oh my god, I think it moved. Yeah, give me the big piece. I'll see you later.
ELAINE Hi George.
GEORGE I'm back, baby, I'm back!
KRAMER Want some mango?
ELAINE No, thanks.
JERRY Well well, if it isn't the first lady of the American Theatre. What brings you here?
ELAINE Just gonna return some of your things that were in my house.
JERRY Oh and I've got some things of yours here.
ELAINE I know.
JERRY Well I'll get them.
ELAINE I'm waiting.
JERRY All right. You got my fins?
ELAINE Yeah I got your fins. You got my poker chips?
JERRY I got your poker chips. You got my goggles?
ELAINE They're next to the fins. You got my cards?
JERRY They're next to the poker chips.
ELAINE All right and that just about... does it.
JERRY I guess.
ELAINE Okay, well... see you around.
JERRY Yeah, see you.
ELAINE All right, let's go, I give you half an hour.
JERRY What?
ELAINE Come on!
JERRY Are you serious?
ELAINE Look, Jerry, we have to have sex to save the friendship.
JERRY Sex... to save the friendship. Well, if we have to...
KARIN Oh George, oooh.
GEORGE Please, it's not necessary.
KARIN What do you mean it's not necessary?
GEORGE The little extra moan you threw in there. Laying it on a bit thick, don't you think?
KARIN What are you talking about?
GEORGE What am I talking about? Come on. You don't think I bought all that?
KARIN What, what?
GEORGE You're very good. Very good with the moanings and the gyrations. You really had me going there for a minute.
KARIN You think I was faking?
GEORGE Come on: 'Oh George, oh Geeeooorge!' Come on! Not that I don't appreciate the effort that was put into it.
KARIN I'd like you to leave.
GEORGE What?
KARIN I said, I would like you to leave. Come on, just get your clothes on and get out.
GEORGE But why?
KARIN Because I said so.
GEORGE I can't find my glasses.
KARIN Well hurry up.
GEORGE I need to look for my glasses.
KARIN Get out! Get out!! Get out!!!
JERRY It's all George's fault. All that talk about impotence. He got to me. And that orgasm stuff: orgasm this and orgasm that. It's a lot of pressure!
ELAINE You know I'm a little hungry. You wouldn't happen to have any of that mango left?
JERRY I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going "I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack away with. Do you have anything like that? At a party
JERRY Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about.
GEORGE Like you do.
JERRY Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?
GEORGE What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table?
JERRY I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't it?
GEORGE Why did France give that to us anyway?
JERRY It was a gift.
GEORGE So countries just exchange gifts like that?
JERRY If they like each other.
GEORGE There's Elaine.
JERRY See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend.
GEORGE Really? They work here in the office?
JERRY Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything.
GEORGE Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like I've got nothing better to talk about.
JERRY You don't. He's a recovering alcoholic.
GEORGE Really?
JERRY Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.
GEORGE "Off the wagon"?
JERRY I think it's off the wagon.
GEORGE I think it's "on the wagon".
ELAINE Jerry, George, what are you doing here?

ELAINE gasp My god! My watch! You found my watch!
JERRY Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good for you.
ELAINE Where did you find it?

BOSS Mike Lubika?
GEORGE He's a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very insightful...

ELAINE Where's my drink?
JERRY There. So, how did it go?
GEORGE I think he was impressed.
ELAINE No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.
JERRY Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours.
ELAINE Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to hold it.
JERRY I didn't know you meant hold it, I thought you meant hold it.
ELAINE One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.
GEORGE Told you. At a clothing store.
JERRY I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a little too close to trying on a dress.
GEORGE Do I really have to buy her something?
JERRY Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy her a gift. How about this?
GEORGE What is that? Is that cashmere?
JERRY Yeah. She would love cashmere.
GEORGE Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive.
JERRY Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.
GEORGE Wow. Excuse me, Miss?
WOMAN Yes?
GEORGE How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?
WOMAN Oh, here. This is why.
GEORGE What? I don't see anything.
WOMAN See this red dot?
GEORGE Oh yeah.
JERRY Oh it's damaged.
GEORGE Well it's not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?
WOMAN There's no exchanges on this.
GEORGE You think she would care about the red dot?
JERRY It's hard to say.
GEORGE I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?
JERRY Well I can see it.
GEORGE Yeah, but you know where it is.
JERRY Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?
GEORGE Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?
JERRY It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.
GEORGE Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview?
JERRY You want me to take an overview?
GEORGE Please.
JERRY I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview. At Jerry's apartment.
JERRY Yeah so?
ELAINE He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking again.
JERRY Oh boy, can you smell it?
ELAINE No. I can't smell it.
JERRY Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.
ELAINE You don't always smell someone from a drink.
JERRY Yes you do.
ELAINE What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?
JERRY Yes you would. Kramer enters
JERRY I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?
KRAMER Okay.
JERRY Would you take a drink and let us smell you?
KRAMER You can smell me without the drink.
ELAINE I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.
KRAMER Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?
JERRY I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner. Kramer drinks.
KRAMER All right. Elaine and Jerry lean up really close to him.
JERRY I don't smell anything.
ELAINE Maybe we're too close to the bottle. Jerry's buzzer buzzes.
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE It's George.
JERRY Come on up.
KRAMER That is damn good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.
GEORGE Hello everybody.
KRAMER Hey. I'm going to tell you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going to tell you. I think that you are terrific.
GEORGE Thank you.
ELAINE Hey what's that?
GEORGE It's an early Christmas present.
ELAINE Christmas present? For who?
GEORGE For you.
ELAINE gasp Get out of here.
KRAMER Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, why, it will be our little secret. h-e-double n...
JERRY Kramer. Yeah that'll do.
ELAINE Oh George, this is beautiful. Is this cashmere?
GEORGE Of course it's cashmere.
ELAINE Oh, I love cashmere.
GEORGE Well who doesn't.
ELAINE My, George this must have cost a fortune.
GEORGE Ahh, money.
ELAINE Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?
JERRY I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy.
ELAINE George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me.
GEORGE Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out already. It's for special occasions this thing.
KRAMER What's that red dot on your sweater?
ELAINE What?
GEORGE Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.
ELAINE Uhh. This. It's like a red dot.
GEORGE What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here for a second. Do you see anything here?
JERRY Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.
ELAINE What don't you know?
JERRY I don't know.
ELAINE Well do you see it or don't you?
JERRY Ahem. Say that again?
ELAINE Do you see it or don't you?
JERRY Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question. Jerry goes to the counter and pours some scotch. He drinks it. He comes back groggy.
JERRY Now what did you ask me again. Kramer is snoring. At the office. Elaine is walking by.
ELAINE You're still here. You're a dynamo.
GEORGE I can't believe I get paid for this.
ELAINE I'll see you tomorrow. Elaine walks out. George gets back to work. The cleaning lady comes by.
GEORGE How you doing?
CLEANING_LADY Hello. The lady starts cleaning. George has a thought. He watches the lady as she is cleaning. At Monk's.
JERRY You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are you, how did you do that?
GEORGE Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning women, chambermaids.
JERRY Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too.
GEORGE Why is that?
JERRY It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.
GEORGE So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh...
JERRY Convulsing?
GEORGE Convulsing?
JERRY I don't know, I'm trying to help you.
GEORGE Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.
JERRY You don't drink.
GEORGE I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her.
JERRY So you started drinking.
GEORGE So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me.
JERRY So how was it?
GEORGE Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.
JERRY Good thing the cleaning lady was there. At Jerry's apartment.
ELAINE Dick was fired.
JERRY You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened.
ELAINE You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all?
JERRY What are you saying?
ELAINE I'm not saying anything.
JERRY You're saying something.
ELAINE What could I be saying?
JERRY Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.
ELAINE If I was saying something I would have said it.
JERRY Well why don't you say it?
ELAINE I said it.
JERRY What did you say?
ELAINE Nothing. It's exhausting being with you. Jerry's buzzer buzzes.
JERRY Yeah?
GEORGE It's George.
JERRY Come on up.
ELAINE Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.
JERRY No I didn't.
ELAINE Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.
JERRY I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.
ELAINE How much did he save?
JERRY Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing. Elaine gets up and goes into the bathroom.
GEORGE I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet.
JERRY Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions.
GEORGE Did you tell her anything?
JERRY No.
GEORGE Do you swear?
JERRY I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.
GEORGE Oh you told her didn't you.
JERRY No.
ELAINE Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount?
GEORGE What? Did I what?
ELAINE You did didn't you.
GEORGE Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.
ELAINE Well Jerry told me that you did.
GEORGE You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything.
JERRY I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.
GEORGE Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot. At the office.
GEORGE This is for you.
CLEANING_LADY Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me? Oh I knew you cared for me.
GEORGE As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What, with Clarence Thomas and everything.
CLEANING_LADY Okay, okay, can I open it now?
GEORGE Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like this very much.
CLEANING_LADY Oh! Is that cashmere?
GEORGE Of course it's cashemere.
CLEANING_LADY A cashmere sweater. Oh Georgie Porgie!
GEORGE Just a little something for Christmas.
CLEANING_LADY When I was a little girl in Panama, a rich American came to our town and he was wearing the softest most beautiful sweater. I said to him, "what do you call this most beautiful fabric?", and he said "they call it cashmere". I repeated the words "cashmere, cashmere". I asked if I could have it, and he said "No. Get away from me." Then he started walk away. But I grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater and he dragged me through the street. And then he kicked at me with the other foot and threw some change at me. Oh, but I didn't want the change Georgie. I wanted the cashmere.
GEORGE I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later.
CLEANING_LADY Wow, look at this. It feels so beautiful.
GEORGE Take it off. You're going to ruin it.
CLEANING_LADY What's this? At the comedy club.
JERRY I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can.
DICK The only stench is comming from you.
AUDIENCE Oooooh.
JERRY Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back on the wagon.
DICK It's off the wagon.
JERRY In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?
DICK I don't know.
JERRY On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?
DICK You can't drink on a wagon it would be too bumpy.
JERRY They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?
DICK What the hell do you know about wagons?
JERRY I know enough not to get on them. In the boss' office.
BOSS I'm going to get right to the point. It has come to my attention that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse on the desk in your office. Is that correct?
GEORGE Who said that?
BOSS She did.
GEORGE Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ingnorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.
BOSS You're fired.
GEORGE Well you didn't have to say it like that.
BOSS I want you out of here by the end of the day.
GEORGE What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability there?
BOSS Nah. Wait, wait, she wanted me to give you this. He tosses the sweater and it lands right on top of George's face. George walks out of the office "wearing" it. In the hall of the office.
ELAINE You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.
GEORGE You never had sex in the office before?
ELAINE No. I once made out with someone but that was it.
GEORGE Alright so you made out with someone.
ELAINE Well that's not sex.
GEORGE Kissing is sex.
ELAINE Kissing is not sex.
JERRY George?
GEORGE Jerry.
ELAINE Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?
GEORGE No.
JERRY George?
GEORGE Over here.
ELAINE What are you doing here?
JERRY I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.
ELAINE Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?
JERRY I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.
ELAINE So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.
JERRY Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night. crash
DICK Merry Christmas.
ELAINE Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.
GEORGE Hide, hide under the desk.
ELAINE Ow, ow move over.
JERRY Get off of me.
ELAINE I've got no room. Dick walks over dragging behind him a Christmas tree. He looks down and notices them under the table. George holds out the sweater, his hand shaking.
DICK Is that cashmere?
GEORGE Of course it's cashmere.
DICK What's this? At the comedy club.
JERRY But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.
DICK You mean on the wagon.
JERRY Don't get smart.
GEORGE Oh, boy I was up to four in the morning watching the Omen trilogy.
JERRY That's good stuff.
GEORGE I can't to myself. I'm exhausted.
JERRY Can you grab a nap at work.
GEORGE Not with that big glass window looking out into the hall. I'd love a good nap. That's the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning. I'll see ya'.
ELAINE Bye.
JERRY So what are you doing now?
ELAINE I'm going to take a little stroll through the park.
JERRY With a gentleman caller?
ELAINE Yes, his name is Hal.
JERRY The walking date is a good date. You don't have to look right at the other -person.
ELAINE It's the next best thing to being alone.
JERRY Shower?
KRAMER No, pool. I just swam 200 laps.
ELAINE You are kidding.
KRAMER Look at hose babies . They're prunes. I saw Conrad going up to oyur place.
ELAINE Oh, yeah, that's right. Those new kitchen cabinets. How is that coming?
JERRY A little slow. I've got to hold this guy's hand on every little decision.
ELAINE Hey, Kramer, listen, you've seen the Omen right?
ELAINE What exactly was that kid?
KRAMER Who, Damien? Nothing, just a mischievous, rambunctious kid.
WILHELM Oh, George, have you seen the American league directory? It is a big green book. Oh, thanks kiddo.
ELAINE Well I don't care. It was delicious.
ELAINE Wanna sit down?
HAL Oh, I don't sit on park benches. They're very bad for the back.
ELAINE Really?
HAL I threw my back out about 15 years ago. Ever since I have been very careful. I only buy furniture in the ergonomics store.
ELAINE Oh those places have the stupidest names. Like, uh, "Back in ", or "Good Vertibrations".
HAL Not this one. It's called the "Lumbar Yard".
CONRAD Oh, Jerry are you okay with this hinge?
JERRY Yeah.
CONRAD I can get you any kind you want, you know. Four holes, three holes, two holes, bronze, no hinge at all.
JERRY You know, why don't we just go with the one in your hand?
CONRAD Oh, these are different.
JERRY Drop one. . . . left!
GEORGE Jerry, look at my eyes.
JERRY A little less beady today.
GEORGE Because I'm refreshed. I finally found a way to sleep in my office. Under the desk. I lie on my back. I tuck in the chair. I'm invisible.
JERRY Sounds like a really cool fort.
CONRAD Jerry, do you want a flat edge on this molding or do you want me to bevel it?
JERRY I'll tell you what I would like you to do with it.
GEORGE Conrad, is it?
CONRAD Conrad, Connie, or Con, whatever you prefer.
GEORGE Uh, let me ask you a question. Could you, uh, expand the space underneath a desk to give it a little more headroom?
JERRY He's kind of tied up here.
GEORGE It'll have to be a night job anyway. You don't normally work after dinner, do you?
CONRAD There is no normal, whatever jerry wants. He wants me here late, I'm here late, he wants me here early, I'm here early, he . . .
JERRY Why don't you just work on George's project for a while?
CONRAD Whatever you want.
JERRY So how was Wednesday's walk in the park with Hal.
ELAINE Uh, it was okay,. He's coming over later to watch a movie. Hey listen, what's better for your back? Couch cushions or a folding chair?
JERRY I don't know.
ELAINE Uh, maybe we'll just stand and watch the tv. . I gotta go someone's at my door. Yeah!
DELIVERY_GUY Delivery. Elaine Benes?
ELAINE Yeah.
DELIVERY_GUY We're from the Lumbar Yard, we got your mattress.
ELAINE Mattress, I didn't order a mattress. Who sent this? Hal Kitzmiller?
GEORGE Do you think it might be possible to add a little shelf like, uh, for an alarm clock?
CONRAD You mean like that big?
GEORGE Like this.
CONRAD Yeah, I can do that.
GEORGE Thanks. You know this could sound crazy but, what do you think about adding a drawer for - like a blanket?
CONRAD Blanket or quilt?
GEORGE Blanket.
CONRAD That thick?
GEORGE Maybe like this.
CONRAD Like that?
GEORGE Yeah, like that.
CONRAD If that is what you want.
GEORGE That is what I want.
CONRAD Hey George, you want this cup holder mounted on the left, or the right, or the middle, . . .
GEORGE Whatever!!. . . . Oh oh oh this is unbelievable. This is better than my bed at home.
GEORGE Its been a long night. You go home and get some sleep.
CONRAD If that's what you want.
GEORGE That's what I want.
WILHELM Morning George.
GEORGE Good morning Mr. Wilhelm.
KRAMER got problems Jerry.
JERRY What happened?
KRAMER Well I had been swimming for three hours and I was in a real grove so I decided to keep going. But at ten they start the aquasonics Thirty-five geriatrics throwing elbows. It was like I was swimming through a flabby armed spanking machine.
JERRY How long did that last?
KRAMER A half hour then diving class started. Well... that got a little messy. I gotta find a new place to swim 'cause that pooll can't hold me, Jerry.
JERRY How was the movie?
ELAINE I cancelled. Hal sent a mattress to my apartment. The nerve of that guy.
JERRY Why?
ELAINE He's got a back problem.
JERRY So you think he was expecting a roll in the supportive hay.
ELAINE After one date!
KRAMER What's that guy's last name again?
ELAINE Kitzmiller.
KRAMER Oh, that's right.
JERRY So what are you going to do with the mattress?
ELAINE I don't know. Chuck it?
KRAMER Oh, no no no no I'll take it. Why don't you come over. Let's see if it will fit in my bedroom.
ELAINE Oh, all right.
KRAMER My old one sprung a leak.
ELAINE You have a water bed?
KRAMER Sand! It's like sleeping on the beach.
CONRAD Hi, Jerry I'm sorry I'm late. George and I have been up working all night long. I can make up the time in any number of ways.
JERRY How about this? . . . Finish this thing up today!
CONRAD Couple of questions for you.
JERRY No. No more questions. Just figure it out for yourself and get it done.
CONRAD All right Jerry. But I can figure it out myself any way you want.
JERRY Just . . . do it.
STEINBRENNER Costanza? Where's Costanza? . . . Excuse mois? Have you seen Costanza?
SECRETARY I've seen him around.
STEINBRENNER Um, I'm stuck on this song yesterday. I can't seem to get it out of my head. I don't know the name of that. "She's a heart breaker, love taker . . ..Oh. Oh" . . .very catchy. You know what? I can't stay awake for that guy. What is this? People? Um, the most beautiful people people. Ally Selica, Nothing wrong with that uh?
HAL Elaine, your taking this totally the wrong way. That's not what Ii intended.
ELAINE Well, what did you intend, Hal?
HAL I just wanted you to have the comfort and report you deserve. That's why I had the mattress custom designed for you.
ELAINE Custom designed?
HAL They adjust the foam density and spring tension to your body type. I estimated your height and weight. Five eight, about 110 pounds?
ELAINE Uh, that is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.
HAL So you do like the mattress?
ELAINE Oh, I love it. I'm glad . . . I kept it.
FATHER Over there, that's Brooklyn . That's where Spike Lee lives.
SON Hey, there's a man swimming in the water.
FATHER Naw, that's probably just a dead body son. You see when the mob kills someone they through the body in the river.
KRAMER Jer.
JERRY Hi.
KRAMER Well my swimming pool problems are solved. I just found myself miles and miles of open lanes.
JERRY What is that smell?
KRAMER That's East River.
JERRY You're swimming in the East River? The most heavily trafficked overly contaminated waterway on the eastern seaboard?
KRAMER Technically Norfolk has more gross tonnage.
JERRY How could you swim in that water?
KRAMER I saw a couple of other guys out there.
JERRY Swimming?
KRAMER Floating, they weren't moving much. But they were out there. Jerry looks around the new renovation.
ELAINE Hey, Kramer, it's Elaine, thanks for bringing my mattress back. And I guess I'll just get my spare key from you - whenever. All right, bye.
ELAINE Oh, this is a good mattress. Sniff, sniff, Ugh!
STEINBRENNER What is with this guy? I've been waiting three and a half hours. Should I go? No way Jack! ??? at the registrar again, I'll tell you that.
CONRAD Mr. Steinbrenner?
STEINBRENNER That's what they call me.
CONRAD Your grandchildren are here to see you.
STEINBRENNER Oh, well, send them in. Send the little tykes in. ... little people .. pony express ... wow,
JERRY hello.
GEORGE Jerry, I'm trapped under my desk. Steinbrenner is in the room. You got to help
STEINBRENNER Boy can you think of what went through my mind when I saw there wasn't going to be enough room under that desk for me and my babies.
GEORGE I'm sorry sir.
STEINBRENNER You know what I think? I think you knew about that bomb ahead of time.
GEORGE What?
STEINBRENNER ???? about that bomb. You climbed under that desk because you have ESP. George, what's on my mind? . . . Meatballs! Huh? Unbelievable. Anyway this terrorist had a specific demand. Not more cheap adjustable hats on hat day. He wants fitted hats just like the players wear.
ELAINE Jerry, Jerry.
JERRY Yeah.
ELAINE What the hell is this? Where are you?
JERRY Over here. You can see right through here.
ELAINE What is this. It's like you're selling movie tickets back here.
JERRY It's kind of cozy.
ELAINE Hey, you're not going to believe what Kramer did to my mattress. . . . I can't talk to you like this. So Kramer completely funked up my mattress.
JERRY Does it smell like the East River?
ELAINE How did you know?
JERRY Because Kramer has been swimming laps between the Queensborough bridge and the Brooklyn bridge.
ELAINE Oh, great!
KRAMER Oh man, I'm on the wrong floor again.
ELAINE Hey, thanks for ruining my mattress. It reeks.
KRAMER Hey, you know what I think it is? I think it's that East River. I think it might be polluted.
GEORGE Well, you really did it to me this time, Seinfeld. . . . What the hell happened here?
ELAINE Hi.
GEORGE Hi. Look at how obtrusive this is.
ELAINE It is obtrusive, isn't it?
KRAMER It is very obtrusive.
JERRY I don't think it's that bad.
KRAMER You can't get a stool in here.
JERRY No the stools go over there.
KRAMER No, that's no good. I'm leaving.
ELAINE I'm with you. I'm going back to my place.
GEORGE Fitted Hat Day! That's what you asked Steinbrenner for?
JERRY You mean they're actually doing the fitted hats? Cool.
GEORGE Guess who he put in charge of Fitted Hat Day? Me.
JERRY Hey look at you.
GEORGE Yeah, look at me. Now I gotta figure out the hat sizes of 59,000 different people! W What if a pinhead shows up? I gotta be on top of that.
JERRY No knock offs. I want the ones like the real players wear.
GEORGE ??? knock offs. I not going to do it! And you're going to call Steinbrenner back and cancel the whole thing.
JERRY Could you at least get a hat for me?
GEORGE Fine. What size?
JERRY Seven and five eighths
GEORGE Seven and five eights!
JERRY Why are you shouting?
GEORGE I don't know. It's this place. I'm very uncomfortable here.
HAL So are you liking the mattress?
ELAINE I am totally loving it. Uh, you know ... we should um ... get going.
HAL What is that smell?
ELAINE What smell?
HAL I think it's the mattress. Did something happen to it.
ELAINE No no, oh, you know what that is? I um, went claming the other day and I forgot to hose off my boots.
HAL Claming?
ELAINE Yeah, clam and scallop. I clam and scallop.
STEINBRENNER Yes, yes, come in.
GEORGE Sir, I just got a call from the terrorist. I told him to call back here.
STEINBRENNER Just let me ask you something. Is it "February" or " February"? Because I prefer "Febuary" and what is this "ru"?
GEORGE Let me put that on speaker phone.
STEINBRENNER Hello are you the bomber?
JERRY Yes this is the terrorist bomber.
STEINBRENNER Costanza here is busting his ass on those hats.
JERRY think I've changed my mind.
STEINBRENNER You don't want them, then goodbye.
GEORGE ??? sir.
STEINBRENNER Well what do you want instead?
JERRY What?
STEINBRENNER Well, you're the terrorist. You're going to want something.
JERRY I guess it would be nice if you called all the ticket holders if the game was going to be rained out.
STEINBRENNER All right George, you can handle that.
STEINBRENNER Costanza what the hell are you doing?
GEORGE You have to stand tough sir. That's why I had to hang up the phone.
STEINBRENNER You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to run around the stadium and close all the windows. That's where I'm going, pal. And I'll tell you something else. I'm very nervous.
ELAINE Gotta get some of that stuffed crust pizza. cheese crust pizza.
HAL It's just more cheese.
ELAINE I'll tell you something. It'll be years before they find places to hide more cheese on a pizza. Kramer!
KRAMER Oh, hey,
ELAINE Oh, hi. This is Hal. Hal, this is Kramer. Kramer, Hal.
KRAMER Hal, .. uh Langerhans.
HAL Kitzmiller.
KRAMER Oh, Kitzmiller. That's right
ELAINE You feeling jiff?
KRAMER Oh, I'm jiff.
HAL That smell...
KRAMER Oh, listen I gotta get to the pier. The ferry traffic is really bad around four thirty. Look, I still got the key to your apartment and I'll get it back to you as soon as I can.
ELAINE Oh, baby.
GEORGE Lunch.
HAL Kramer? Can I talk to you a minute?
KRAMER Yeah, sure, um, oh boy, . . .
HAL Kitzmiller.
KRAMER That's it.
HAL You and Elaine are pretty close.
KRAMER Oh, we go back a ways.
HAL And you've, . . . how do I put this? You've been in her bed?
KRAMER That's right.
HAL But this isn't still going on.
KRAMER No, no. She put a stop to that.
HAL That's all I needed to know. So you actually swim in this thing?
KRAMER Oh yeah. Exercises every muscle in the body. It's great for the back.
HAL Great for the back. Right.
KRAMER Four hours in this chop and I'm a full inch taller. . . . Giddyup.
STEINBRENNER "Heatbreaker, Brewbaker, ..." Hey George, I remember that tune. George? George? Um, what's that ticking. Oh oh. Oh, oooh,...wo wo wo wo . fire in the hole!
ELAINE I wouldn't believe the Lumbar Yard wouldn't pick this up. Ug, oh, okay, . . .
CONRAD You want it back the way it was?
JERRY Yeah, that's right.
CONRAD You know I don't get you Seinfeld. You want something one day. The next day you don't like it. Come on man, make a decision.
JERRY One second. Hello.
ELAINE Jerry you gotta help me. I threw my back out.
JERRY Just lie down.
ELAINE I am lying down. I am trapped under a funky mattress. I gotta go get a doctor or at least come over and roll this thing off of me.
JERRY All right. I'll be right there., Conrad I gotta go.
CONRAD Stay, go whatever.
HAL Hey, Kramer.
KRAMER What's going on?
HAL I told my Chiropractor how swimming in the river made my back heal. He recommended it to all his patients.
OLD_MAN Step aside.
KRAMER He just sunk like a stone.
GEORGE Sir, I'm sure it's not a police matter.
STEINBRENNER Don't be so sure George. Mess with them and they're messing with you. All right boys send it in
STEINBRENNER What's that figure ahead? Is that anything? Okay, let's check the desk. That's where I heard the ticking. Search each one of those drawers starting with the top one. So, empty calories and male curiosity, eh, Georgie?
BOMB_COP Looks like there's more compartments underneath.
STEINBRENNER Compartments underneath, that's probably where it is. Okay boys, let 'er rip. I'll tell you what George. Starting tomorrow no more desks. Just Lucite tables and four legs.
KRAMER Hey, watch where you're kicking!
ELAINE Kramer.
KRAMER Elaine
ELAINE I can't believe it. Hey, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
KRAMER Yeah.
ELAINE Yeah.
GEORGE Hi Connie, Jerry around?
CONRAD No, and I prefer "Conrad". So I heard what happened to the desk.
GEORGE There was something so reassuring about that cozy little space.
CONRAD Yeah, well, whatever. See ya'
JERRY Ah, back to normal. Not bad for four thousand bucks. . . . I can't believe I got the Low Fat!
JERRY So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me... the finger. It seems like such an... arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person. It's a finger, what does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers and I'm supposed to feel bad. Is that the way it's supposed to work? I mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldn't you? I would feel worse if I got the toe, than if I got the finger. 'Cause it's not easy to give someone the toe, you've gotta get the shoe off, the sock of and drive, get it up and uh look at that toe, buddy. I mean, that's really insulting to get the toe, isn't it ?
JERRY Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella, something boring to read on the plane. That's it. Done!
ELAINE That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen.
JERRY I am...the master packer.
ELAINE Yeah, right, you're the master packer.
JERRY What you must understand, Elaine, packing is no different than leading men into battle. You've gotta know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks.
ELAINE 'Scuse me...master packer!
JERRY ...Yes.
ELAINE Just gimme your keys.
JERRY Alright, sir. George?
GEORGE Yeah
ELAINE OK, so, now, is there anything else I need to know 'bout this place?
JERRY uh, yeah, the uuhh, hot water takes a little while to come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all your shopping, you...come back and take a shower.
ELAINE OK, this is quite a place.
JERRY There's more, the refrigerator. Deduct a minimum of two days of all expiration dates. No meat, no leftovers, no butter. that clear?
ELAINE I'll eat out.
JERRY One more thing, Benes, regarding sexual activity: strictly prohibited, but if you absolutely must, do us all a big favor, do it in the tub.
GEORGE Ready?
JERRY Yeah, one sec.
GEORGE Hey, Elaine
ELAINE Hi.
GEORGE Coming to the airport with us?
ELAINE No, I'm staying here for the weekend. I'm getting a break from my roommate.
GEORGE Oh, the actress-waitress.
ELAINE No, the waitress-actress. She just got some part in some dinner-theater production of a Chorus Line. So, now all day "God, I hope I get it, I hope I get it". She's gonna get it right in her...
GEORGE You just kick her out.
ELAINE She's on the lease!...George you have got to find another place for me.
GEORGE Yeah, well...a little rough finding something good in your price-range. But you, my friend, may be in luck.
JERRY I'm not looking.
GEORGE No no no, this one's different, this one's a beauty!
JERRY Yeah, what's it like?
GEORGE I haven't seen it yet, but it's a "two-bedroom", it's on the uh, west 83rd, 'bout a half block from the park?
JERRY How much?
GEORGE Uh, twice what you pay in here, but it's a great building, it's two bedrooms!
JERRY Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough trouble maintaining activity in one. I saw that.
ELAINE You oughtta least take a look at it.
JERRY Really? Why?
ELAINE 'Cause then I could move in here.
JERRY Ooohhhh
ELAINE It's time you got out a here anyway.
GEORGE Yeah, tell'm, but quickly, I'm double parked here.
ELAINE Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have no hot water, you can't have soft cheese...
GEORGE Let's not forget the radiator, the steam has been on here for ten years; no human can turn this off.
ELAINE Jerry, come on, you're doin' OK now, you should at least take a look at this place. You shouldn't have to live like this.
JERRY Like this? You just said, you wanted to live here.
ELAINE Well, for me it's a step up. It's like moving from Iceland to Finland.
GEORGE Jerry, what do ya...you wanna...you wanna see the place or not?
JERRY I can't think about it now. Come on, I'm going to Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend.
JERRY Elaine!
JERRY Elaine!
ELAINE Jerry! Jerry, oh, hi, welcome back. How were the shows?
JERRY Great, I had fun, where's the TV, where's the VCR.
ELAINE What? They were stolen.
JERRY Stolen? When?
ELAINE A couple a hours ago, the police are coming right over.
JERRY Stolen?
ELAINE Someone left the door open.
JERRY You left the door open?!
KRAMER Uh, Jer, well ya know, I was cookin' and I, I uh, I came in to get this spatula...and I left the door open, 'cause I was gonna bring the spatula right back!
JERRY Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?
KRAMER The door.
JERRY The door? You left the door open?
KRAMER Yeah, well, I was gonna bring the spatula right back.
JERRY Yeah, and?
KRAMER Well, I got caught up... watching a soap opera... The Bold and the Beautiful
JERRY So the door was wide open?
KRAMER Wide open!
JERRY And where were you?
ELAINE I was at Bloomingdale's...waiting for the shower to heat up.
KRAMER Look, Jerry, I'm sorry, I'm uh, you have insurance, right buddy?
JERRY No.
KRAMER How can you not have insurance?
JERRY Because...I spent my money on the Clapgo D. 29, it's the most impenetrable lock on the market today. It has only one design flaw. The door must be closed.
KRAMER Jerry! I'm gonna find your stuff. I'm gonna solve it, I'm on the case, buddy, I'm on the case!
JERRY Yeah, don't investigate, don't pay me back, it was an accident.
KRAMER I made a mistake.
ELAINE These things happen
KRAMER I'm human
JERRY In your way.
POLICEMAN Let's see, that's uh, one TV, a stereo, one leather jacket, a VCR and a computer...is that 'bout it?
ELAINE Answering machine.
JERRY Answering machine. Oh, I hate the idea of somebody out there returning my calls.
POLICEMAN What do ya mean?
JERRY It's a joke.
POLICEMAN I see...Well, mister Seinfeld uh, we'll look into it and uh, we'll let you know if we uh, you know, if we find anything.
JERRY You ever find anything?
POLICEMAN No.
JERRY Well, thanks anyway.
POLICEMAN You bet.
ELAINE I didn't get that joke either.
JERRY The crook has the machine. The messages aren't for him. He's the crook, why would he why would he answer. How did you get in here?
GEORGE I walked in, your lobby door is broken again.
JERRY Again.
GEORGE I don't know how you put up with this.
ELAINE Yeah, tell'm George.
JERRY You would still wanna move in here?
ELAINE Yes! You don't understand. I'm living with Ethel Merman without the talent.
JERRY Is that uh, other apartment still available.
JERRY I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now, the first couple a times you go through it, it's very upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will say "Call the police. You really should call the police." So "Yeah, I'm calling the police. Stakeouts, manhunts...I'm gonna see some real action." Right, you think that. So, the police give you your copy. Now...unless they give the crook his copy, I don't really think we're gonna crack this case, do you?...It's not like Batman, where there's three crooks in the city and everybody pretty much knows, who they are. Very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot. "Did you lose a sony? It could be the Penguin...I think we can round him up, he's dressed like a penguin! We can find him, he's a penguin!
ELAINE Oh, well, come on...this is an apartment, this is a home! This is a place to live...Oohhh, a fireplace, are you kidding me! Does this work?
GEORGE I didn't know there was a fireplace. A fireplace, this is incredible.
JERRY How do you get all that wood in here?
ELAINE They deliver it.
JERRY They deliver wood?
ELAINE Yeah.
JERRY Whatta ya tip a "wood guy"?
GEORGE I didn't know there was a fireplace?
ELAINE Look! Look at...look at this! There's a garden.
GEORGE A garden! I can't believe there's a garden!
JERRY Would I have to get a gardener?
ELAINE Yeah, you can get a gardener.
JERRY You tip him?
ELAINE You can.
GEORGE You don't tip a gardener!
ELAINE You can tip a gardener.
GEORGE You don't need a gardener.
ELAINE Jerry, you can barbecue back here .
JERRY They deliver the coal?
ELAINE Sure, it's...probably the same guy, who delivers the wood.
JERRY Oh, than I gotta tip him.
ELAINE Oh damn, this place is incredible, look at all this great light!
JERRY I don't have any plants.
GEORGE I have plants.
ELAINE Jerry, look at this closet! Look at this! I'm walking in it! It's a "walk-in". Can you believe it? I'm nuts about this, what do you think?!
JERRY ...I like that. What do ya think, George?
GEORGE It's your decision.
JERRY I'm takin' it, I'm takin' the place, I'm gonna take it, this is gonna be my new place, I'm livin' here...I'm movin'.
ELAINE You're movin'? That means I'm movin'. Gheeeeee isn't that incredible!
GEORGE Congratulations.
ELAINE What about the couch?
JERRY You like the couch? I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do.
ELAINE What?

ELAINE A $150 dollars? A $150 dollars for what? For this couch?
JERRY Yeah!
ELAINE For this couch?!
JERRY OK, you tell me, what is it worth?
ELAINE OK, uuhh...I'll tell you what...I could go as high as uh... I don't know, maybe...20 dollars?
JERRY Yeah?
GEORGE Yeah, it's George.
JERRY Come on up. Oh, all right, forget it, I'm gonna take it with me now... I'm just gonna pack up the cushions right now...
ELAINE OK ok ok ok, you win: $40 dollars.
JERRY You wanna get the other end, 'cause I wanna get it in the hall.
ELAINE $50 dollars, OK? $50 dollars, is that all right?
JERRY $50 dollars?
ELAINE Uh-huh.
JERRY Thank you very much.
ELAINE Thank you very much.
GEORGE Hey, what's goin' on?
ELAINE I just bought Jerry's couch for $50 dollars.
JERRY So did you bring the lease? All right, ghee, three years, that kinda seems like a long time.
GEORGE Oh, Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry , listen, if, if you are feeling uncomfortable about this at all, at all do not feel like you have to take it.
JERRY Why?
GEORGE If you're having second thoughts, if you didn't want it, don't worry about it because uh, ya know, I, I...I could take it, ya know.
JERRY You could take it? You want it?
GEORGE No, I don't want it. I want it, if you don't want it.
JERRY So you do want it.
GEORGE No I, I want it if you don't want it!
JERRY You just said, you wanted it!
GEORGE No, I'm saying, if a situation arose in which you didn't want it, I might take it.
JERRY So take it.
GEORGE How can I take it?!
JERRY How can I take it?
GEORGE It's your apartment!
JERRY How can I want it now, if you want it?
ELAINE Excuse me, uuhh, I don't mean to cause any trouble here, but George, if you take it, can I take your place?
GEORGE Yes, but I am not taking it.
JERRY I...am not taking it.
ELAINE Well, one of you better damn well take it!
JERRY Well, whatta you wanna do here?
GEORGE I, I don't know.
JERRY Do you wanna flip a coin?
GEORGE ...Who flips?...You'll flip, I'll call.
JERRY OK, fine... This is the official flip! No crying, no guilt, winner takes all and that's it, agreed?
GEORGE I'm good.
ELAINE I don't know, who to rune for, George's place has carpeting.
JERRY All right, now you call it in the air.
GEORGE No catchin'.
JERRY No no.
GEORGE Flip it. Heads!
JERRY Tails!
GEORGE No, it hit the table, it hit the table.
JERRY So what?
GEORGE Interference. You can't count that. Come on, are you crazy? The coin cannot touch anything, it affects it.
JERRY You didn't call no interference!
GEORGE You don't have to call that. That's a rule!
JERRY I don't believe this.
GEORGE Oh oh oh, all right, fine, Jerry, you win. Take it, just take it!
JERRY I don't wanna win it like this! Elaine, what do ya think?
ELAINE I'd better not...
JERRY ...Well, I'll tell ya what: I'll choose you for it. Straight choose, three takes it, no disputes...that's it, you gotta win three.
GEORGE OK ...Ok. I'll choose you...whatta ya want?
JERRY Odds

GEORGE Why did I put up two? Why did I put up two?
KRAMER Jerry, I think I'm on to something. I think I found your stuff. You know the Englishman, who lives down the hall?
JERRY Yeah.
KRAMER The last couple a days he's been acting very strange; I think he's avoiding me.
JERRY Hard to imagine.
KRAMER Yeah! And get this: I just got of the elevator with him and I tested him, I tested him, like I...this is what I said to him, like I, I was like thism I went: "Oh, by the way, I know about thestuff."
JERRY Right.
KRAMER Ya know, very casually, so that he was gonna take me in to his confidence.
ELAINE So what did he say?
KRAMER "What stuff?".
JERRY Ooh, case closed!
KRAMER No, you don't understand, you see, he swallowed...see, the guy, he swallowed. Oh, he was nervous about something! Now, I'm gonna go over there, I'm gonna borrow some tee...if I don't get back in five minutes, maybe you'd better call the police.
JERRY OK, starting ...now!
KRAMER Yeah!
JERRY One of the problems in life is that when you're a kid,you have a certain way of working out disagreements...andthose laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main waythat kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of themsay: "I got the front seat" "I wanted thefront seat!" "I called it". And the otherkid knows he's got nothing to say: "Hecalled it, what can I do?". If there was a "kid-court of law"it holds up: "Your Honour, my client did askfor the front seat"...and the judge would go: "Did he callit?" "Well no, he didn't call..." bang! "He has to call it, case closed...objection overruled".
GEORGE I love the mirror in that in that mirror. I don't know if it's the tile or the lighting...I feel like Robert Wagner.
JERRY It's a good mirror... So, what are ya gettin'?
GEORGE I don't know, I can't eat, ya, ya can't have anything. French Fries. Out. blt. Out. I go to visit my grandparents,three big brisket sandwiches, I'm sittin' here with a carrot! They're closing in on a hundred, I'm sayin' to them: "How can you eat that stuff?!"... I'm so sick about losin' that choose, you don't know.
JERRY Oh, right, forget it, forget it, I'm not taking the place!
GEORGE What?!
JERRY How can I live there?
GEORGE Why not?!
JERRY Look at you, you're still thinking about it, I'll never feel comfortable.
GEORGE Oh, get out a here.
JERRY How can I ever have you over? You'll sit there moping.
GEORGE Mope?
JERRY You're already moping!...Would you take the place?
GEORGE No, impossible! It's your apartment.
JERRY You found the place.
GEORGE You won the choose.
JERRY All right, forget it, it's over, I'm not moving.
GEORGE Well, me neither.
JERRY Definitely?
GEORGE Definitely.
JERRY Oh, than just get rid of it. You won't have any problem.
GEORGE No, it's not a problem, I can get rid of the apartment this afternoon.
WAITRESS What apartment?
GEORGE Oh, it's a great place, it's uh "two-bedroom" uh, west 83rd 'bout half block from the park.
WAITRESS What's the rent?
GEORGE I don't know, what we're doin' here, this is ridiculous.
JERRY She wanted to thank us for the apartment.
ELAINE I can't believe I lost the deposit on that u-haul. And I threw out my couch.
JERRY If only the coin hadn't hit the table.
GEORGE The table is interference, you know it!
JERRY It is not!
GEORGE It is too!
ELAINE My roommate starts rehearsal tonight on Carrousel.

CAROL Diane, Diane, come here. This is my new next door neighbour, Diane. These are the guys, who turned this place down, can you believe it? Diane gave me the greatest backrub today, she's a masseuse!
DIANE How, how could you guys have turned this place down, it's such a great location and it's...so close to the park.
GEORGE We're aware of the proximity to the park, yes.
DIANE Well, it was nice to meet you.

JERRY oh I'm sorry I didn't get most of that.. isn't that Kramer over there?
ELAINE yeah, yeah
JERRY hey Kramer
KRAMER what? hey it's all set

ELAINE that's right honey, and I know you!
JANE no, no, no!!!
ELAINE here, take it
JANE don't call me anymore
JANE you either
JERRY Now, I was thinking the other day about hair, and that the weird thing about it, is that people will touch other people's hair. You will actually kiss another human being, right on the head. But, if one of those hairs should somehow be able to get out of that skull, and go off on its own, it is now the vilest, most disgusting thing that you can encounter. The same hair. People freak out. "There was a hair, in the egg salad!"
GEORGE Say it's Saturday night in Spain. They go out dancing. You think they do the flamenco?
JERRY I would think.
GEORGE So you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she's free for Dinner and a flamenco?
JERRY You don't flamenco on the first date.
GEORGE Boy, I wish the flamenco was popular here.
JERRY Yeah? Would you do it?
GEORGE Yes, I think I would.
JERRY Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the dance of a very proud people.
JERRY Hello. Oh, hi Nana. What? Oh. Oh, alright, okay. Don't worry about it. Okay, I'll see you later. Alright, bye.
JERRY I have to go over to my grandmother's.
GEORGE What for?
JERRY I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.
GEORGE So, what, no lunch?
JERRY No, we have time.
GEORGE Oh. How's she doing?
JERRY Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has Difficulty distinguishing between the past and the present.
GEORGE Ah. You know, there's gotta be an easier way to open ketchups. They should make it in a tube.
JERRY Like toothpaste?
GEORGE Ya-hah.
JERRY There's a squeeze ketchup.
GEORGE I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup.
JERRY Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason that they make squeeze ketchup?
GEORGE Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.
JERRY I really don't see the difference.
GEORGE Oh, there's a difference. It's subtle.
JERRY It's subtle.
GEORGE Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?
JERRY Yeah, there she is. Uh-oh.
GEORGE What?
JERRY Ah, she's with her friend Wendy.
GEORGE Wendy? Is that the uh, physical therapist?
JERRY Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.
GEORGE Really?
JERRY Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did it once, on her birthday, somehow it mushroomed. Now I dread seeing her because of it.
ELAINE Hey.
GEORGE You know, I'm down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia.
JERRY Ah, that's fortunate. I really admire that.
GEORGE Huh. I never heard you say you admire me for anything.
JERRY No, I told you I admire your hearing.
JERRY No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing.
ELAINE Wendy, George. Wendy. Wendy and George shake hands.
GEORGE You're uh, physical therapist, right?
WENDY Yes.
GEORGE You know, I got this little swelling right here. It's kinda painful. What d'you make of it?
ELAINE George.
WENDY Have you tried heat and ice on it?
GEORGE Oh that uh, that seems like a lotta trouble.
WENDY Well, you could come by my office later, I could work on it for you a little.
GEORGE Oh! Okay.
WENDY Let me give you my card.
GEORGE Oh, thank you.
WENDY Well, I'll see you guys later. Nice meeting you. Bye Elaine.
ELAINE Bye Wendy. I'm sorry.
WENDY Bye Jerry.
JERRY Bye.
ELAINE What did you do that for?
GEORGE What?
ELAINE Ask about your arm.
GEORGE I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm.
ELAINE She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal with that outside of the office.
GEORGE Why not?
ELAINE Because, it is what she does.
GEORGE I love these people, you can't ask 'em questions. They're so mentally gifted that we mustn't disturb the delicate genius Unless it's in the confines of an office. When huge sums of money are involved, then the delicate genius can be disturbed!
ELAINE George, you got a little something, right here.
GEORGE People think they're so important...
JERRY Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my last kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her.
ELAINE Why?
JERRY Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I don't see the point to it. I'm not thrilled with all the handshaking either, but one step at a time.
GEORGE What're you getting?
JERRY And what's with that hairdo, by the way?
ELAINE Huh, yeah, I know. It's not very flattering.
JERRY She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You Should say something to her.
ELAINE Oh, I could never say anything to her about that.
JERRY Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like that.
ELAINE Yeah. Hah.
GEORGE Well, just tell Kramer to tell her.
ELAINE No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it.
JERRY What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come out with it.
ELAINE Hoh. Yes, yes, you're right. That's right. I'll bring her over to meet...
ELAINE ...Kramer.
KRAMER Hello, boys and girls.
JERRY Speak of the devil.
KRAMER Yeah. Hey listen, I uh, I need a picture of you, buddy.
JERRY What for?
KRAMER Well, I'm uh, I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby of our building.
JERRY Why?
KRAMER So everyone will know everybody's name. See, people are gonna be a lot friendlier.
JERRY I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the lobby.
KRAMER Imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say "Hey, Carl!" and he says "Hey, Jerry!" You see, that's the kind of society I wanna live in.
JERRY Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with everyone, every time I go in the building. I just wanna nod and be on my way.
KRAMER You know your eyeliner's smudged a little. Why do you wear so much eye makeup?
ELAINE Yeah. This is gonna work out just fine.
LEO Ma! Again with the ketchup? Don't they have 'em in the plastic Squeeze containers?
LEO Jerry! Hello!
JERRY Hello, uncle Leo!
LEO What're you doing here?
JERRY Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.
LEO Yeah, me too.
NANA Hello Jerry.
JERRY Hi Nana.
LEO Aren't you gonna kiss her hello?
JERRY Yes. Yes of course.
NANA Ha, well, here's the bottle.
LEO I'll do it.
JERRY What're you doing, I got it.
LEO Give it to me.
JERRY Will you stop it.
LEO Jerry, will you give me the bottle?
JERRY Uncle Leo! Alright! Take it!
NANA You should let Buddy open it.
LEO Buddy? He lived next door to us forty-five years ago.
NANA Leo, did you give Helen the fifty dollars?
LEO What fifty dollars?
NANA Your father won a thousand dollars at the track last week, and he gave you a hundred, and you were supposed to give fifty dollars to your sister.
LEO Ma, dad died in nineteen-sixty-two.
LEO Believe me. I don't owe your mother fifty dollars. Leo continues to force out laughter, and Jerry continues his look of mistrust.
JERRY I'm just not getting any hot water.
JULIO Hey, believe me, I know there's nothing worse than when your shower's not working. I'm gonna take care of it as soon as I can, Jerry.
JERRY Thanks, Julio.
JULIO Awright.
JERRY Huh?
KRAMER Hey, hey hey hey. Hello!
JERRY What's going on here?
KRAMER Ohh, nothing, nothing.
JERRY Well, then what're you doing?
KRAMER Oh, I, I need a pen.
JERRY What for?
KRAMER Well, I'm making out my will. Oh, I got a big slice of dough for you, buddy. And you too, Elaine, I haven't forgotten you.
JERRY You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you?
KRAMER You got that straight.
JERRY I told you, forget it.
KRAMER Oh, come on, Jerry. If everybody knew everybody, we wouldn't have the problems we have in the world today. Well, you don't rob somebody, if you know their name!
JERRY You're robbing me.
KRAMER Well, I'm gonna get your picture, and you're gonna participate in my program.
ELAINE Wha... W.. Are you going home?
KRAMER Yeah.
ELAINE Uh, could you come back in about five minutes?
KRAMER Why?
ELAINE No reason. Just wanna see you again.
JERRY So? Are you sure Wendy's coming?
ELAINE Yeah, she'll be here any second.
JERRY Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer Says something. You sure you wanna go through with this?
ELAINE Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her hair.
JERRY Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to help her open a ketchup bottle. Hey, mom, let me ask you a question. Do you remember when you were a kid, your father winning like a thousand dollars at the track? Really? Did you know he gave uncle Leo a hundred dollars, and he was supposed to give you fifty? How do I know? Because Nana doesn't know what year it is, and she thinks this just happened. Well, I think you should. Okay, bye.
MORTY Do you know what the interest on that fifty dollars comes to Over fifty-three years?
HELEN Oh, Morty, please.
MORTY Six hundred and sixty-three dollars and forty-five cents. And that's figuring conservatively at five percent interest, over fifty-three years, compounded quarterly. Or, if you put it into a ten-year T-bill...
HELEN Morty, will you stop it!
MORTY Well, he's not getting away with this!
JERRY Yeah?
WENDY Wendy.
JERRY Come on up.
ELAINE Well, this is it. Shall I go get Kramer?
JERRY No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first opportunity to not kiss her hello.
ELAINE What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's face?
JERRY It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in, you know you have to do this. I mean, if you could, say, touch a breast as part of the kiss hello, then I think I could see the value in it a little better.
ELAINE How 'bout an intercourse hello? How would that be?
JERRY Elaine, now you're being ridiculous.
ELAINE That's her. That's her.
ELAINE_AND_WENDY Hi.
JERRY Hi Wendy.
WENDY Oh, hi Jerry.
JERRY Would you like something to drink?
WENDY Sure.
JERRY There you go.
WENDY Ah.
JERRY Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars.
JERRY So, how's everything going?
WENDY Oh, okay. Oh, your friend George came by the office the other day, and then yesterday he cancelled on me.
JERRY Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist.
ELAINE Oh, you hear that? That must be Kramer.
KRAMER Hey! Jerry!
JERRY C'mon, that's not fair!
KRAMER I told you I was gonna get it.
JERRY No, c'mon Kramer. Gimme that picture.
KRAMER Aagh. No no no no no.
JERRY Alright, fine. Put my picture up. What do I care?
ELAINE Uh, Kramer. Kramer, I'd like you to meet my friend Wendy.
KRAMER Oh, hello.
WENDY Hi.
KRAMER Yeah.
KRAMER You know, I really like that hairdo.
WENDY Oh. Thank you. I actually was thinking it might be time for a change.
ELAINE Oh, you were?
WENDY Well, I...
KRAMER Oh, no no no. You don't wanna do that. No no. Nobody wears it like that.
ELAINE Kramer, if she wants to change her hair...
KRAMER No, no. you'd be a damn fool to change it. It's very becoming.
WENDY Oh, well.
WENDY Oh, ho.
WENDY So, who's that friend of yours? That guy that came in.
ELAINE Oh, Kramer.
WENDY Yeah. Does he have a girlfriend?
ELAINE You wanna go out with him?
WENDY Well, why not?
ELAINE Well, it's just that... uh, I don't...
WENDY What, is there anything wrong with him?
WENDY Elaine?
ELAINE I'm just thinking about the question.
GEORGE You know, my arm feels a lot better. That Wendy really knows her stuff.
RECEPTIONIST She is super. Same time tomorrow.
GEORGE Yeah, same time. There you go.
RECEPTIONIST Oh. Ah, you owe a hundred and fifty.
GEORGE What for?
RECEPTIONIST Well, you cancelled on Tuesday, and our policy is "twenty-four hours notice, for all cancellations".
GEORGE Well, I, I couldn't come. I, I had to drive my mother to, to the chiropodist.
WENDY What's the problem?
GEORGE Are you aware that I'm being charged for Tuesday's appointment? I had to take my mother to the chiropodist.
WENDY Well, I'm sorry, that's our policy.
GEORGE Oh, you have a policy! The delicate genius has a policy!
RECEPTIONIST So. Will you be here tomorrow?
GEORGE Well, it's less than twenty-four hours, so I guess I have to!
KRAMER Hey! So what d'you think? You like it?
JERRY Oh my god! Look at that picture, it's terrible...
JERRY ...You can't put that picture up.
KRAMER Well, it's not a beauty contest. It's just a way for people to get to know one another.
STEVE Hey Cosmo.
KRAMER Hey...
KRAMER ...Steve. Ah, you see?
ELAINE Hey Kramer, my friend Wendy wants to go out with you.
KRAMER Well, how do you do?
MARY Hello, Jerry.
JERRY Oh. Hello, uh Mary.
MARY You know, I've seen you so many times and now we can finally talk to each other.
KRAMER What was I telling you? Isn't this nice?
JERRY Yeah.
MARY Jerry. You know, could you help me with a package?
JERRY Oh, sure, yeah.
MARY Thank you.
JERRY Oh, no!
JERRY You see? That's just what I need. More kissing!
ELAINE Hee, hee, hee. Hee hee hee...
JERRY What is so funny?
ELAINE Nothing, nothing.
JERRY Hello. Oh, hi mom. What? Oh my... He didn't?! He couldn't! Alright, I will. Okay, bye.
JERRY Uncle Leo put Nana in a home!
ELAINE Why?
JERRY I don't know. Maybe to keep her quiet.
JOAN Hi Jerry. Mmmwah.
JERRY Hi Joan.
JOAN How you doing?
JERRY Pretty good.
JOAN Just pretty good? Not great?
JERRY Okay, great.
JOAN Are you happy?
JERRY Oh, I'm delighted.
JOAN Okay. Have a nice day.
JERRY You too.
LOUISE Hi Jerry.
JERRY Hi, Louise.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Ah, well. Thank you very much!
KRAMER For what?
JERRY For putting my picture up on that wall! I'm like Richard Dawson down there now. And every person I see engages me in this long, boring, tedious, conversation. I can't even get out of the building!
KRAMER You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world of loneliness and isolation. Now, you're part of a family.
JERRY Family?
KRAMER Yeah.
JERRY You think I want another family? My father's demanding my uncle Pay interest on fifty dollars he was supposed to give my mother in nineteen-forty-one, and my uncle put my nana in a home to try and shut her up! And I tell you another thing, Cosmo Kramer, whatever you wanna be called. The kissing thing is over. There's no more kissing, and I don't care what the consequences are.
RECEPTIONIST Oh, hi. Mister Costanza, we were trying to get in touch with you. Wendy can't make her appointment.
GEORGE What d'you mean?
RECEPTIONIST She had some personal affair she had to attend to. I left A message on your machine. You didn't get it?
GEORGE When did you leave the message?
RECEPTIONIST Few hours ago.
GEORGE Oh, I'm sorry, I require twenty-four hours notice for a cancellation. Now, as I see it, you owe me seventy-five dollars.
RECEPTIONIST Look, Mister Costanza...
GEORGE Will that be cash, or cheque?
WENDY I am really glad I took the day off.
ELAINE Oh, yeah, there's nothing better than skiing.
WENDY Yeah. I hope my clients weren't too upset.
ELAINE Ugh, the hell with 'em.
ELAINE What're you stopping here for?
WENDY I'm dropping you off.
ELAINE Oh, no, I'm three more blocks.
WENDY Yeah, but if I take you to your door, then I have to go all the Way around Central Park West, back to Columbus, you know it's all one way...
ELAINE Yeah, but it's only three blocks.
WENDY Right. It's only three blocks.
ELAINE Alright, well...
ELAINE She'd driven me a hundred and twenty miles and, all of a sudden, three blocks from my door, she decides this trip is over. Isn't that strange?
JERRY Yes, it's very strange. Very strange.
ELAINE I've never heard of anything like this. I mean, it's almost as if I was hitch-hiking and she says "Well, this is as far as I can take you."
JERRY I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car With someone with a hairdo like that.
ELAINE I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles. I think I pinched a nerve in my shoulder.
JERRY You should have her work on it for you.
ELAINE Yeah, alright, I gotta go.
MARY Hi Jerry.
JERRY Hi Mary.
JERRY Uh, listen. I decided I can't kiss hello anymore. I'm sorry. It's nothing personal....
JERRY ...It just makes me a little uncomfortable and I can't do it. I'm sorry.
LOUISE Hi Jerry.
JERRY Hi Louise...
JERRY ...I was just telling Mary how I'm not gonna be doing the kiss Hello thing anymore. I'm sorry. I just can't do it. It's nothing personal, it's just I'm not really able to do it and uh, I'm sorry.
JERRY Thank you for your cooperation.
JERRY Hello.

JERRY Hi mom. So, what's happening with uncle Leo? Is he paying you? In Florida, Helen is on the phone and Morty is still working out figures with a pad and a calculator.
HELEN Well, he said no. He said we had no proof.
MORTY No proof? We'll get him. He's a crook, sooner or later, he'll slip up.
HELEN Uh, anyway, I want you to go check on Nana at the home.
JERRY Okay, I will.
MORTY D'you realise, an above-average performing growth mutual fund For fifty-three years...

JACK Hey. Hi Cosmo.
KRAMER Oh, hey, Jack. How you doing?
JERRY Hi Jack.

JERRY No no, that's not true!
JULIO Well, I think it is! It's a big building, Seinfeld, maybe I'll get to it someday. After I take care of the people who're civil to each other.
NURSE Yeah, she's upstairs, playing cards.
JERRY You know, she really doesn't belong here. My uncle put her here, Because he's trying to prove he doesn't owe my mother fifty dollars.
NURSE Well, she seems very happy. She met an old friend who used to live next door to her.
JERRY Buddy?
NURSE Yes, that's his name. He's right over there.
WENDY I'm sorry, I don't owe you anything. I had some personal business that day.
GEORGE Oh, I see. So your time is more valuable than mine. Is that it? You're a delicate genius!
WENDY A delicate genius?
GEORGE Elaine?
ELAINE George!
GEORGE Hah. Good luck.
WENDY What's going on?
ELAINE Wendy, I injured my shoulder, Wednesday, when You dropped me off and I had to carry my skis, and my boots, and my poles and everything, all the way home. I'm, I'm having trouble lifting my arm. Do you think you could give me some treatment?
WENDY Oh sure. You have insurance, right?
ELAINE Insurance? You're charging me?
GEORGE Wednesday? That's your personal business?! Skiing?! So let people suffer, while you're shushing all over a mountain?
WENDY How did you hear that?
GEORGE I hear everything.
WENDY I mean, why don't you two just take your business elsewhere, hmm?
ELAINE Oh, huh huh, that is a good idea. C'mon George.
GEORGE Yeah. Let's go.
ELAINE And you know, you might wanna do something about that hair.
WENDY Why, what's wrong with my hair?
ELAINE Huh, I think it's a little old-fashioned. Don't you? Uh, tell her.
RECEPTIONIST She's right.
JERRY So you were with him that day at the track?
BUDDY Oh yeah. He won a thousand dollars. His son was there too.
JERRY Leo?
BUDDY Yeah, that's it. Leo. Ooh, what an obnoxious little kid. He used to steal my soda bottles. and cash 'em in for the deposits, uh?
JERRY Is that so?
BUDDY And, after your grandfather hit the daily double, he gave him a Hundred dollars, and told him to give fifty to his sister. His sister? Why I tell you he shoulda give it to me for all the bottles he took!
JERRY Well, that's very interesting.
JERRY Uncle Leo! I just met an old acquaintance of yours. You remember Buddy. He just told me quite a story about you and Grandpa at the track.
LEO One second...
JERRY You're busted!
JERRY Hey, Steve. How you doing?
JERRY Hey, Jeff. What's happening?
JERRY Mary! Oh, Mary! Give us a kiss.
JERRY Don't be like that, Mary. C'mon, I made a mistake!
MARY Look, why don't you do everybody a favour, and just get out of this building? Nobody wants you here. Nobody!
JEFF Hi Mary.
MARY Hi Jeff. How are you?
MARY Hi Pete. How you doing?
PETE Hey, let's go get some coffee.
JEFF Great idea.
MARY Oh, that'd be great.
JERRY Oh, Paul, could you hold that door...
KRAMER Hi.
JERRY Hey. Could I use your shower?
KRAMER What, again? You took one this morning.
JERRY I got a date. C'mon, please.
KRAMER I know but I... Little problem.
KRAMER Wendy here?
KRAMER No no no. She changed her hairstyle, it's terrible. No, we're done.
GUY I'll go get some more beer.
KRAMER Oh yeah, yeah, great. And get some of those blue corn chips.
KRAMER Hey.
STEFANIE Hi Cosmo.
KRAMER Hi.
STEFANIE Mmmwah.
KRAMER Ooh, I like that.
JERRY Who's that?
KRAMER Stefanie. 2-G.
JERRY Oh man. Looks like you got quite a few people here.
KRAMER Yeah yeah. Well uh, you know, I'd invite you in, but uhm... you know.
JERRY Oh, yeah, I understand.
JERRY I love it when you get your car back from the car place, and it's got that paper mat on the floor. Like they're so obsessed with cleanliness, they don't even want their shoes to touch the carpet. Meanwhile, the mechanic comes out; he looks like Al Jolson. He's covered in goo, from head to toe. You can't even see him. Although, I prefer that to when they have the lab coat, The clipboard and the nice glasses. Now you know you're getting screwed. 'Can I see it?' 'You better not. It's idling quietly right now. I think it should stay overnight. We wanna keep an eye on it, and we wanna keep the bill running up.'
WILHELM And you can tell the players that I reimburse the trainer for the cigarettes and the dive checks.
GEORGE Sorry, the players will be reimbursed?
WILHELM The trainer, George. Tell the players I'll reimburse the trainer. What's the matter with you? This is the third time I've had to repeat myself.
GEORGE Sorry, Mr Wilhelm.
WILHELM Look, sorry doesn't cut it. We're running a ball club here George. You've got to pay attention.
GEORGE I know, sir. It won't happen again.
WILHELM Lemme see, I uh, I had an assignment for you... uh.
WILHELM Lemme think here.
PETERMAN Elaine.
ELAINE Hi, Mr Peterman.
PETERMAN You know what a huge fan I am of John F Kennedy.
ELAINE I do.
PETERMAN It was the Peace Corps that gave me my start in this business. Clothing the naked natives of Bantu Besh.
ELAINE The pygmy pullover.
PETERMAN Sotheby's is having an auction of JFK's memorabilia. One item in particular has caught my eye. The presidential golf clubs. To me, they capture that indefinable romance that was Camelot.
ELAINE Whatever.
PETERMAN But, unfortunately I will be out of town with my lady-friend And therefore unable to bid on the lot. I was hoping maybe you would go in my stead.
ELAINE Oh. Oh yeah, I'd be happy to. Uhm, how much d'you want this thing? I mean, you know, how high are you willing to go?
PETERMAN I would see no trouble in spending up to, say, ten thousand dollars. Have my secretary give you a signed cheque.
ELAINE Wow.
WILHELM ...when you're done George, and bring it directly to me. Mr Steinbrenner is very interested in this.
GEORGE Yes, sir.
WILHELM Yes, George. I want you to make this project a top priority.
GEORGE I will, sir. Top priority.
WILHELM Top priority.
GEORGE Top priority.
GEORGE So he walks out of the stall, he's been talking the whole time.
JERRY He pulled an LBJ on you.
GEORGE lbj?
JERRY Lyndon Johnson, used to do that to his staffers.
GEORGE No kidding?
JERRY Oh yeah. He'd hold national security meetings in there. He planned the Hanoi bombing after a bad Thai meal.
GEORGE Well, I still don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't even know what my assignment is.
JERRY Ask him to repeat it. Tell him there was an echo in there.
GEORGE I can't. He's been on my case about not paying attention. Besides, it's too late, I already told him I heard him.
JERRY You know what you do? Ask him a follow-up question. Tell him you're having trouble getting started, and you want his advice.
GEORGE Yeah, follow-up question, that'll work.
KRAMER Hey buddy.
JERRY Hey.
GEORGE Hey.
JERRY Can I have my keys...
KRAMER Yeah.
JERRY ...back, please?
KRAMER You shoulda come, Jerry.
NEWMAN We made quite a haul.
GEORGE Where'd you go?
KRAMER Price club.
GEORGE Why didn't you take your car?
KRAMER Ah, the steering wheel fell off. I don't know where it is.
KRAMER What're you doing. Don't throw that away.
NEWMAN Well, I'm not paying the five cents for that stupid recycling thing.
KRAMER You don't pay five cents, you get five cents back. Here, read the label here. Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York. Refund, vrrup, five cents.
NEWMAN Refund?
KRAMER Yes.
JERRY Well, what d'you think the hoboes are doing?
NEWMAN I don't know, they're deranged.
GEORGE Awright, listen, can you uh, gimme a lift back to my place?
JERRY No I can't. I gotta pick up Elaine. I'm taking her to this Kennedy auction.
GEORGE Awright, I'll see you later.
NEWMAN What is this 'MI, ten cents'?
KRAMER That's Michigan. In Michigan you get ten cents.
NEWMAN Ten cents!?
KRAMER Yeah.
NEWMAN Wait a minute. You mean you get five cents here, and ten cents there. You could round up bottles here and run 'em out to Michigan for the difference.
KRAMER No, it doesn't work.
NEWMAN What d'you mean it doesn't work? You get enough bottles together...
KRAMER Yeah, you overload your inventory and you blow your margins on gasoline. Trust me, it doesn't work.
JERRY Hey, you're not talking that Michigan deposit bottle scam again, are you?
KRAMER No, no, I'm off that.
NEWMAN You tried it?
KRAMER Oh yeah. Every which way. Couldn't crunch the numbers. It drove me crazy.
JERRY You two keep an eye on each other?
NEWMAN_AND_KRAMER No problem. You bet.
JERRY Are you sure you didn't hear my car making a funny noise? I know Those two idiots did something to it.
ELAINE No, I didn't hear anything. Oh, my God, look who's here.
JERRY Sue Ellen Mishke, the braless 'O Henry' candy bar heiress. Sue Ellen notices them, and comes over.
SUE_ELLEN Well. Hello Elaine. Jerry.
ELAINE Hi Sue Ellen.
JERRY Hi Sue Ellen.
SUE_ELLEN I'm surprised to see you here. Come to catch a glimpse of high society?
ELAINE Oh, ho ha ha. No, no, I'm actually here to bid, Sue Ellen. I mean that is if anything is to my liking.
JERRY I'm here to catch a glimpse... of high society.
SUE_ELLEN Well, I hope you find something that fits your budget.
ELAINE I... hate that woman.
NEWMAN I don't understand. You fill an eighteen-wheeler?
KRAMER No, an eighteen-wheeler's no good. Too much overhead. You got permits, weigh-stations, tolls... Look, you're way outta your league.
NEWMAN I wanna learn. I want to know why.
ELAINE Oh. Those are handsome. Look at that set. Yeah, think I might bid on those.
AUCTIONEER Lot number seven forty-five.

JERRY Okay.
ELAINE Alrighty, bye.
JERRY Bye. What's going on here? Oh God! Oh, you idiots!
NEWMAN So we could put the bottles in a U-haul. You know, go lean and mean?
KRAMER Newman, it's a dead-end, c'mon. Hey, there he is.
JERRY Hey. You put your groceries under the hood of my car?
KRAMER Aw, that's right, we forgot about those.
NEWMAN That's where my missing soda is.
JERRY And your crab legs, and a thing of cheese. The Triple-A guy said I was this close to sucking a muffin down the carburetor. What were you thinking?
KRAMER We ran outta space.
JERRY Now I gotta take the car down to Tony and get it checked out.
KRAMER Ah, Tony, he's good.
JERRY Yeah, he's real good. But he's so obsessive about the car. He makes me feel guilty about every little thing that's wrong with it. I gotta get it washed before I bring it down to him, or I'm afraid he'll yell at me.
KRAMER 'Choke?'
JERRY No, thank you.
TONY Oh, yeah. I remember this car. Beautiful car.
JERRY Yeah. So, anyway, the engine's been idling a little rough. I thought it might be time for a check up...
JERRY There's really nothing wrong on the inside.
TONY Well, the shift knob is loose. You know about that?
JERRY No, I hadn't noticed.
TONY Have you been picking at it?
JERRY Have I been picking at it? No. You know. It's just wear and tear.
TONY Wear and tear. I see.
JERRY The engine is really the only thing that needs checking.
TONY You been rotating the tires?
JERRY Try to.
TONY You don't try to. You do it! Fifty-one percent of all turns are right turns. You know that? 'Try to.'
PETERMAN Twenty thousand dollars!?! Elaine, that's twice the amount I authorised you to spend.
ELAINE I know, Mr Peterman, but but but but once I saw them, I just couldn't stand to let anyone else have them. You know, certainly not some stuck-up candy bar heiress who shamelessly flaunts herself in public without any regard...
PETERMAN Well, where are they?
ELAINE They should be here today.
GEORGE Uh, Mr Wilhelm.
WILHELM Yes George.
GEORGE Hi, I was just uh... I just had one little question about uh, My assignment.
WILHELM Yes, well I trust things are moving smoothly. Mr Steinbrenner's counting on you, you know.
GEORGE Yes, yes. Very smooth, super smooth. No, but I really wanna attack this thing, you know. Sink my teeth into it. So I was just wondering... what do you think would be the very best way to get started?
WILHELM Get started? I don't understand, George.
GEORGE Well, I was wondering...
WILHELM You mean you haven't been to payroll?
GEORGE Payroll? No, no, I haven't done that.
WILHELM Well, what's the problem? Now come on George. I told the big man you were moving on this. Now, don't let him down! Wilhelm leaves.
GEORGE Payroll!!
GEORGE Hello there. I'm George Costanza.
CLERK Yes?
GEORGE Assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm uh, working on the project.
CLERK What project?
GEORGE Payroll project. Wilhelm? Big uh, big payroll project.
CLERK You're gonna have to fill me in.
GEORGE You know what, I'll just uh, I'll just look around for a little while. I'll just browse around.
CLERK Hey, wait, hey. Excuse me, uh, you can't come Back here.
GEORGE Look, I am under direct orders from Mr Wilhelm. So if you have a problem with that, maybe you should just take it up with him.
CLERK Well, maybe I will.
GEORGE You know what, I urge you to take it up with him. Go ahead, give him a call, he'll tell you what I'm doing here. Then you can tell me.
CLERK Mr Wilhelm, uh, this is Lafarge in payroll. Uh, there's a Costanza here, says he's working on some project?
CLERK Oh. Oh, I see. Interesting. Well, that's quite a project. Alright, thank you.
CLERK Ah, I'm sorry uh, that I doubted you. Whatever you need, just uh, make yourself at home.
GEORGE So he explained it all to you?
CLERK Yes, he explained it all very clearly.
GEORGE What'd he tell you?
CLERK Look! You were right, I was wrong! You don't have to humiliate me about it, alright!
NEWMAN Damn!
NEWMAN Oh, Mother's Day. Wait a second. Mother's Day?!
NEWMAN Yessss!
NEWMAN Ahaha!
NEWMAN Come on Kramer!
KRAMER Wha...?
NEWMAN It's the truck, Kramer. The truck!
KRAMER Look, Newman, I told you to let this thing go.
NEWMAN No, no, no, no no. Listen to me. Most days, the post office sends one truckload of mail to the second domestic regional sorting facility in Sagenaw, Michigan.
KRAMER Uh-huh.
NEWMAN But, on the week before holidays, we see a surge. On alentine's Day, we send two trucks. On Christmas, four, packed to the brim. And tomorrow, if history is any guide, will see some spillover into a fifth truck.
KRAMER Mother's Day.
NEWMAN The mother of all mail days. And guess who signed up for the truck.
KRAMER A free truck? Oh boy, that completely changes our cost structure. Our G and A goes down fifty percent.
NEWMAN We carry a coupla bags of mail, and the rest is ours!
KRAMER Newman, you magnificent bastard, you did it!
NEWMAN Let the collecting begin!
WILHELM So... George snaps awake.
WILHELM ...did you go down to payroll?
GEORGE Yes, payroll. Yes I did. Very productive. Payroll... Paid off.
WILHELM Well then, I guess you'll be heading downtown then, huh?
GEORGE Oh, yeah. Downtown. Definitely.
WILHELM Well, I'm very interested to see how this thing turns out.
GEORGE Yeah, you said it. Uh, excuse me, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, do you really think... Well, is this downtown trip really necessary, you know, for the project?
WILHELM Oh no, you've got to go downtown, George. It's all downtown. Just like the song says.
GEORGE The song?
WILHELM There's your answer. Downtown. Wilhelm leaves.
GEORGE Downtown.
JERRY The song Downtown? You mean the Petula Clark song?
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY You sure he didn't just mention it because you happened to be Going downtown?
GEORGE I think he was trying to tell me something, like it had some sort of a meaning.
JERRY Okay, so how does it go?
GEORGE 'When you're alone, and life is making you lonely, you can always go...'
JERRY '... downtown.'
GEORGE 'Maybe you know some little places to go, where they never close...'
JERRY '...downtown.'
GEORGE Wait a second. 'Little places to go, where they never close.' What's a little place that never closes?
JERRY Seven-eleven?
GEORGE 'Just listen to the music of the traffic, in the city. Linger on the sidewalk, where the neon lights are pretty.' Where the neon lights are pretty. The Broadway area?
JERRY No, that's midtown.
GEORGE 'The lights are much brighter there. You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares, just go...'
JERRY '...down town.'
GEORGE 'Things'll be great, when you're...'
JERRY '...downtown.'
GEORGE I got nothing, Jerry. Nothing.
JERRY Well, 'don't hang around and let your troubles surround you. There are movie shows...'
GEORGE You think I should come clean? What d'you think, you think I Should confess?
JERRY How can you lose?
TONY Yeah, Jerry, it's Tony Abato at the shop. Look, we gotta talk. You better come down, any time after four.
JERRY Hello.
ELAINE Hi, it's me.
JERRY Oh, hi.
ELAINE Listen, I need to come over and pick up the clubs for Peterman.
JERRY Oh, you know what?
ELAINE Oh no. What?
JERRY Oh, no. It's no big deal. I left the clubs in the car.
ELAINE You left them in the car? How could you leave them in the car?
JERRY I forgot.
ELAINE Oh, go down and get them.
JERRY I can't. The car's at the mechanics.
ELAINE Ah, this is great. Alright, well, where is the mechanic? I'll just go and pick 'em up myself.
JERRY No, no, you can't. He's working on the car right now. You can not disturb him while he's working. But I'm going down there in like an hour, if you wanna meet me down there. You know the place, it's on fifty-sixth street?
ELAINE Ugh, okay, alright, fine.
JERRY Hey, Tony.
TONY Thanks for coming in, Jerry.
JERRY Sure.
TONY I think I know what's goin' on here, and I just wanna hear it from you. But I want you to be straight with me. Don't lie to me, Jerry. You know that motor oil you're puttin' in there? From one of those quicky lube places, isn't it?
JERRY Well, I change it so often, I mean to come all the way down here...
TONY Jerry, motor oil is the lifeblood of a car. Okay, you put in a low-grade oil, you could damage vital engine parts. Okay. See this gasket? I have no confidence in that gasket.
JERRY I really wanna...
TONY Here's what I wanna do. I wanna overhaul the entire engine. But it's gonna take a major commitment from you. You're gonna have to keep it under sixty miles an hour for a while. You gotta come in, and you gotta get the oil changed every thousand miles.
JERRY How much money is this gonna cost me?
TONY Huh. I don't understand you. It's your own car we're Talking about. You know you wrote the wrong mileage down on the form? You barely know the car. You don't know the mileage, you don't know the tyre pressure. When was the last time you even checked the washer fluid?
JERRY The washer fluid is fine.
TONY The washer fluid is not fine!
JERRY Alright, you know what, uhm... I just wanna take my car, and I'm gonna bring it someplace else.
TONY What d'you mean?
JERRY Just, can I have my car? I wanna pay my bill, I'm gonna be on my way.
TONY Well, the car's on a lift.
JERRY Well, just get it down.
TONY Alright. Okay. Well, uhm, wait here and I'll uh, I'll bring it around.
JERRY Okay. Thank you, very much.
ELAINE Hey. Where's the car?
JERRY He's bringing it.
ELAINE Good.
JERRY Let me ask you a question.
ELAINE Mm-hm.
JERRY You're a hostage, captured by terrorists-
ELAINE Who, me?
JERRY You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think they would ever consider doing the laundry?
ELAINE They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention.
KRAMER You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it off, take it off!
KRAMER Hey, Georgie.
JERRY_AND_ELAINE Hi.

GEORGE My mother caught me.
JERRY "Caught" you? Doing what?
GEORGE You know. I was alone..
ELAINE You mean..?!
GEORGE Uh-huh.
KRAMER She caught you?
JERRY Where?
GEORGE ..I stopped by the house to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody was there - they're supposed to be working. My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing through it..
JERRY "Glamour"?
GEORGE ..So, one thing lead to another..
JERRY So, what did she do?
GEORGE First she screams, "George, what are you doing?! My God!" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it.
KRAMER Man..
GEORGE I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up.
JERRY What did you do?
GEORGE I zipped up!
ELAINE So, she fell?
GEORGE Yeah. Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was!
ELAINE No, I guess you couldn't have..
JERRY No, I wouldn't think so.
ELAINE ..done that.
GEORGE So, she fell, and then she started screaming, "My back! My back!" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital.
ELAINE How is she?
GEORGE She's in traction.
ELAINE Ok, I'm sorry.
GEORGE It's not funny, Elaine.
ELAINE I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.
GEORGE Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was, "Why, George, why?!".. I said, "Because it's there!"
JERRY "Glamour"?
GEORGE Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. that , again.
ELAINE What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together?
GEORGE All together.
ELAINE Oh, gimme a break..
JERRY Ohhh yeah.. right.
KRAMER Oh, like you're gonna stop?
JERRY_AND_ELAINE C'mon..

ELAINE Why?
JERRY It's apples and oranges..
ELAINE What? Why? Why?
JERRY Because you're a woman!
ELAINE So what?
JERRY It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.
ELAINE Oh.
JERRY We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh.. shaving.
ELAINE Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs.
KRAMER Not everyday.
GEORGE Alright, look, you want to be in?
ELAINE Yeah!
GEORGE You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta put up two-hundred dollars.
KRAMER No, a thousand!
ELAINE No, I'll - I'll put up one-fifty.
GEORGE Alright, you're in for one-fifty.
JERRY Okay, one-fifty.
GEORGE Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing?
JERRY Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system.
KRAMER Alright.
GEORGE No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, I'll see you later. Yes, of course I'm gonna come by. Alright. My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?! Because she caught me? You know, if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist..
JERRY ..Yeah?
GEORGE Whatever.
JERRY How is she?
GEORGE She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital to see her tonight.
JERRY Yeah?
ELAINE It's me.
JERRY Come on up.
GEORGE Hey, what are you doing tonight?
JERRY Dating Marla.
GEORGE Oh, the virgin?
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE Any, uh.. progress, there? What's the latest?
JERRY Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead.
KRAMER Hey, look at this, c'mere. There's a naked woman across the street.
JERRY Where?
KRAMER Second floor from the top. See the window on the left?
GEORGE Wow!
JERRY Who walks around the house like that?!
GEORGE Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist colony people..
KRAMER ..Yeah.. yeah..
JERRY Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, do they eat naked in the dining room?
GEORGE I would imagine it's all naked.
JERRY What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too?
GEORGE They're naked, the gardeners naked.. the bellhops. One big nude-a-rama.
ELAINE Hey.
JERRY_AND_GEORGE Hey.
ELAINE Well, where's my money? Who caved?
JERRY Not me.
GEORGE Not me.
ELAINE What're you looking at?
JERRY There's a naked woman across the street.
ELAINE This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life. So, my fried, Joyce, is teaching an aerobics class. I'm gonna go tonight.
JERRY Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it back.
ELAINE So then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to go on the space shuttle. We're goin' to Mars.
JERRY Uh-huh.
GEORGE Have a good time.
KRAMER I'm out!
ELAINE What?!
KRAMER Yeah, I'm out - I'm out of the contest.
GEORGE You're out?!
KRAMER Yeah, yeah.. what?
ELAINE Well, that was fast!
JERRY Well, it was that woman across the street. You know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next.
ELAINE ..And then there were three.
ELAINE I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing better to do at three o' clock in the afternoon? I go out for a quart of milk, I come home, and find my son treating his body like it was an amusement park!
GEORGE Ma.
ESTELLE Don't give me "Ma". It's a good thing I didn't hit the table. I could of cracked my head open.
GEORGE Ma, people can hear you.
ESTELLE Too bad you can't do that for a living. You'd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square Garden. Thousands of people could watch you! You could be a big star!
GEORGE Alright, Ma, that's enough!
ESTELLE I want you to go see a psychiatrist.
GEORGE No! I am not going to see a psychiatrist!
ESTELLE Why? Why not?! Why won't you go?
GEORGE Because I don't want to.
ESTELLE I want you to go see somebody.
GEORGE Well, I am not going.
ESTELLE It's a good thing your father's in Chicago.
SHELLY Hello, Aunt Estelle. Look at you - how did this happen?
GEORGE Is that important, really? What is this, a police investigation? The woman's been through enough. She has to relive the experience now?!
NURSE Hi, Denise. Six-thirty, time for your sponge bath.
DENISE Mmm.. is it six-thirty already? I fell asleep.
SHELLY So, George, what are you doing now? I hear you got some kinda television, writing - thing?
GEORGE Yeah.. television.
NURSE Let me help you out with that. Here, just slip it over your head..
DENISE Oh.. thank you.

ESTELLE George, you're cousin, Shelly, is talking to you!
JOYCE So, when was the last time you took a class?
ELAINE Oh, it's been a while.
JOYCE Are you psyched?
ELAINE Yeah. yeah, I'm really.. psyched.
JOYCE Well, you're gonna thank me for getting you in here.
ELAINE Why is that?
JOYCE See the guy with the dark hair and the red shorts?
ELAINE Oh, my God. John F. Kennedy Junior's here!
JOYCE He's gonna be in your class today.
ELAINE In my class? John Kennedy's gonna be in my class?!
JOYCE I can get you a spot right behind him. He has got a great butt.
ELAINE Yeah. Butt. Butt. Great butt. John-John's butt.
MARLA Let's slow it down a little.
JERRY "Slow it down"?
MARLA Well, You know..
JERRY Ah, yeah.. I know.
MARLA You're okay with that, right?
JERRY Yeah, yeah.. of course. What, do you think I care about the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean anything to me. I don't care about that.
MARLA So, I'll see you Saturday night, then?
JERRY Sure, Saturday night.
MARLA Alright, then. Good night.
JERRY Goodnight. Not just a good night - a great night.
KRAMER Goood Moorrrnninng!
JERRY Yeah, good morning.
KRAMER Ha, ha! Nothing like some good solid sack time.
JERRY She's not there. She's doin' her wash.
KRAMER Oh. So, did you make it through the night?
JERRY Yes, I'm proud to say I did!
KRAMER So, you're still master of your domain.
JERRY Yes. Yes I am. Master of my domain. But I will tell you this: I am going over to her apartment, and I'm tellin' her to put those shades down!
KRAMER Woah, woah, woah. What-what did you just say?
JERRY I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls. Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in this contest - something's gotta give!
KRAMER Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?! This is a beautiful woman walking around naked, and you want to tell her to stop?! That's the dumbest thing I ever heard! I mean, think comprehens- I'm not gonna let you do it.
JERRY Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way.
KRAMER No, no, no, no. You can't! You can't! This is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys, looking through our noise throw it away?!
JERRY Look, I'm sorry-
KRAMER No, I'm not gonna let you do it, Jerry.
JERRY Kramer, get outta my way!
KRAMER No, no, no. Don't do it. Don't do it! For my sake! God knows I don't ask you for much! Now, come on. Please, Jerry. Please! I'm beggin' ya! Please! Come on! Please!
JERRY Alright..
KRAMER Yes!
JERRY ..Alright.
KRAMER Thank you, thank you, thank you.
JERRY She's not there!
KRAMER Oh, I can wait..
JERRY So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath?
GEORGE Every night at six-thirty. The nurse was gorgeous.. then I got a look at the patient.. I was going nuts.
JERRY Oh, man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital.
GEORGE Well, my mother, Jerry..
JERRY But are you still master of your domain?
GEORGE I am king of the county. You?
JERRY Lord of the manor.
ELAINE John F. Kennedy Jun-ya!
JERRY What?
ELAINE He was in my aerobics class.
JERRY Really? Did you talk to him?
ELAINE No, you don't understand - he was working out right in front of me. So, listen, after the class was over, I timed my walk to the door so we'd get there at the exact same moment, and he says to me, "Quite a workout."
GEORGE "Quite a workout"? What did you say?
ELAINE I said, "yeah."
JERRY Good one.
ELAINE So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed, and I saw him again, on the way out. So we're walkin' and And I said, "Sure" - even though I was going downtown. So, we get in the cab, and I mean, I have no idea where I'm goin', right? But this is John F. Kennedy Junior we're talkin' about! So, then, he says to me, "Where do you live?" And I - and I - and I was close to your block, so I said your building. So he dropped me off in front, and I had to take a cab all the way back downtown to my house.. Oh, God..
JERRY But the question is, are you still master of your domain?
ELAINE I'm queen of the castle.
ESTELLE You're back.
GEORGE Of course I'm back. Why wouldn't I be back? My mother's in the hospital, I'm going to pay her a visit.
ESTELLE I know, but two days in a row? You didn't have to do this.
GEORGE You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you?
ESTELLE You know what you could do? I haven't eaten lunch or dinner. I can't eat this hospital food. Maybe you could run down to the deli and get me a sandwich..
GEORGE You got it, Ma. A little later.
ESTELLE Could you go now, George? I'm very hungry. I'm weak.
GEORGE Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference?
ESTELLE I don't understand why you can't do this for me!
GEORGE I just got here, Ma! I'd like to spend a little time with you.
ESTELLE But if you wait, they won't let you back in! Visiting hours are almost over!
GEORGE Ten minutes! Here, here, Have some Tic-Tacs.
ESTELLE Get the hell outta here. I'm sorry you came.
NURSE Six-thirty. Time for your sponge bath.
ESTELLE George.. I'm huuunnnggry!
GEORGE Hang on, Ma.. hang on..
JOYCE Hi!
ELAINE Hi.
JOYCE Did you get your hair done today?
ELAINE No, I just, uh, fixed it.. a little bit.
JOYCE You know who - isn't here. He was in the early class today. But I think you made quite an impression on him yesterday.
ELAINE What? What? Who? Me-me-me? I made an impression? What impression?
JOYCE Let me just put this back.
ELAINE No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?!
JOYCE He asked about you.
ELAINE He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about me?! What did he say?
JOYCE He wanted to know your situation.
ELAINE What situation? I have a situation?
JOYCE I-I told him you were single.
ELAINE That was good. That was very good.
JOYCE He said you were just his type.
ELAINE Okay, you tryin' to hurt me? Are you tryin' to hurt - you're tryin' to injure me, right? You're trying to hurt me.
JOYCE He also told me to tell you that he'll be in your neighborhood tomorrow around nine o' clock - so he's gonna stop in front of your building if you want to come down and say hello.
JERRY Alright, Ma, I'll talk to you later.. Nothing, I'm, I'm watching, uh, Tiny Toons here, on Nickelodeon.. It's, I-I like kid shows. They have a very innocent, wholesome quality. Okay, alright, I'll talk to you later. Bye.
KRAMER Oh, that's good. That's good. That's very, very good. Oh, it's hot in there.. It's hot in there. So, just walk around a little bit. Don't be ashamed, don't be ashamed.. that's good, that's good.. yes, yes, yes..
JERRY The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round. The wheels on the bus..
KRAMER The woman across the street has nothing on, nothing on, nothing on..
GEORGE All you got is instant coffee? Why don't you get some real coffee?
JERRY I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the outside! Yeah?!
ELAINE It's Elaine.
JERRY Come on up!
GEORGE Where did you get those socks?
JERRY I don't know.
GEORGE I think those are my socks!
JERRY How are these your socks?!
GEORGE I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore!
JERRY Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They looked so good to me, I just had to have them!
GEORGE Yeah, well, they're my socks!
JERRY They're my socks!
GEORGE Oh boy..
JERRY What are we doing here..
GEORGE ..Oh boy.
JERRY This is ridiculous.
GEORGE Do you believe this? We're fighting. We're fighting.
JERRY I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody.
GEORGE Me too. I've been yelling at strangers on the street.
ELAINE Hello..
GEORGE You caved?!
JERRY It's over?
GEORGE You're out?
JERRY Ohh-my-God. The Queen is dead.
GEORGE I figured you'd cruise. At least through the Spring.
JERRY What happened?
ELAINE It was..uh.. John-John.
JERRY_AND_GEORGE Ohhhhh.. John-John.
JERRY But you made it through the day before.
ELAINE Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight.
JERRY Why outside here?
ELAINE Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up.
JERRY Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me.
GEORGE And then, there were two.
ELAINE Elaine Benes Kennedy Junior..
MARLA Let's go in the bedroom.
JERRY Really?
MARLA Yes.
JERRY You sure?
MARLA Yes.
JERRY You really want to?
MARLA I do. I'm ready.
JERRY Okay..
MARLA I know how difficult this must have been for you.
JERRY You don't know the half of it.
MARLA What do you mean?
JERRY Well, it's kinda silly, but..
MARLA Contest?! A contest! This is what you do with your friends?
JERRY No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with George and his mother-
MARLA I don't want to hear another word. And to think how close I came to you being the one! I must have been out of my mind.
ELAINE Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you-
MARLA I don't want to have anything to do with you or your perverted friends. Ooohh, get away from me! You're horrible. Horrible! All of you!
ELAINE What happened?
JERRY I told her about the contest.
ELAINE Ohh. Boy, she's a whack-o.
GEORGE Hey, what happened?
ELAINE What?
GEORGE I thought you were meeting Kennedy.
ELAINE He didn't show.
GEORGE Yeah, he did.
ELAINE What? He's - He's out there? Oh, my God. I-I gotta go, I gotta go..
GEORGE No, no, no. He just left.
ELAINE What?
GEORGE Yeah, he was talking to Marla.
JERRY Marla?
GEORGE Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and they just drove away.
ELAINE He left with Marla, the virgin?
GEORGE Yeah.
ELAINE They drove away?
GEORGE Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You know, he's - he's-
JERRY Oh my God in heaven!
ELAINE Is that..?
GEORGE Kramer?!
ELAINE He's waving..
MARLA Ohh, John. That was wonderful..
JERRY A couple of days ago I used a public phone, go over time on the call, hang up the phone, walk away. You've had this happen? Phone rings. It's the phone company... they want more money. Don't you love this? And you got them right where you want them for the first time in your life. You're on the street, there's nothing they can do. I like to let it ring a few times, you know, let her sweat a little over there, then I just pick it up, "Yeah, operator... oh, I got the money... I got the money right here... D'you hear that? That's a quarter. Yeah, you want that don't you?"
ELAINE No, they've just got to get more cops on the force, it's as simple as that.
GEORGE Cops. I don't even care about cops. I wanna see more garbage men. It's much more important. All I wanna see are garbage trucks, garbage cans and garbage men. You're never gonna stop crime, we should at least be clean.
JERRY I tell you what they should do, they should combine the two jobs, make it one job, 'cop\garbage man'. I always see cops walking around with nothing to do. Grab a broom! Start sweeping. You sweep sweep sweep... catch a criminal, get right back to sweeping.
ELAINE You should run for mayor.
JERRY Ehh, nobody listens.
ELAINE Where is someone? I'm starving.
GEORGE I think this is him right here.
ELAINE Is there a table ready?
RESTAURANT_MANAGER How many?
ELAINE How many?
JERRY Is Tatiana coming?
GEORGE I don't know, I have to call her, tell her where we are. I'm very lucky she's even considering seeing me at all.
JERRY Really? I thought things were going OK.
GEORGE They were, it's kinda complicated.
JERRY Well what is it?
ELAINE How many?
JERRY Ah, alright, four. Seinfeld.
BRUCE Four. It'll be five, ten minutes.
GEORGE What do you wanna do?
ELAINE Let's go someplace else, I am too hungry.
JERRY We might as well just stay here, we haven't got that much time if we wanna make it to the movie.
GEORGE I gotta call Tatiana. where's the phone?
JERRY Tatiana...
GEORGE Excuse me, are you gonna be very long?
BRUCE Lashbrook, 4!
JERRY So did I do a terrible thing?
ELAINE You mean lying to your uncle?
JERRY I couldn't have dinner with him. 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', one night only, the big screen. My hands are tied!
GEORGE You know it's a public phone, you're not supposed to just chit-chat.
ELAINE Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right away.
JERRY Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table.
GEORGE He knows I'm waiting. He sees me. He just doesn't wanna look.
ELAINE Everything's gotta be just so with you, doesn't it?
JERRY Hey, I offered you those cookies in my house.
ELAINE Health cookies. I hate those little dustboard fructose things.
GEORGE I just can't believe at the way people are. What is it with humanity? What kind of a world do we live in?
ELAINE What?
JERRY There's a woman over there that looks really familiar. Dark hair, striped shirt?
ELAINE I've never seen her before.
JERRY I know this woman. This is gonna drive me crazy.
MAN Oh, Excuse me.
ELAINE I'm sorry.
ELAINE Didja see that? Those people, look, they're getting a table.
JERRY Well maybe they were here from before.
ELAINE No no no, they weren't here before.
GEORGE Excuse me, are you going to be much longer? I have to make a very important call.
ELAINE Find out what's going on!
JERRY Excuse me, didn't those people just come in? I believe we were ahead of them.
ELAINE Yeah.
BRUCE What's your name?
JERRY Seinfeld.
BRUCE No, no, they were here before. Keckitch, 2!
ELAINE Did you ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table? They think they're so special because they've been chosen. It's enough to make you sick.
JERRY Boy, you are really hungry.
GEORGE Hey!
GEORGE If anything happens here, can I count on you?
JERRY What?
GEORGE If we decide to go at it.
JERRY Yeah, I wanna get into a rumble...
GEORGE I have to get in touch with Tatiana! And look at his little outfit. It's all so coordinated, the way his socks matching to his shirt. I really hate this guy.
ELAINE I'm gonna faint...
JERRY George, who is that woman in the stripes?
GEORGE I don't know her.
JERRY She looks so familiar.
ELAINE Ya know, its not fair people are seated First Come First Served, It should be based on who's hungriest. I feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody's plate.
JERRY I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it.
ELAINE What do you mean?
JERRY You walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't say anything, you eat it, say 'thank you very much', wipe your mouth, walk away- I give you 50 bucks.
GEORGE What are they gonna do?
JERRY They won't do anything; in fact, you'll be giving them a story to tell for the rest of their lives.
ELAINE 50 bucks, you'll give me 50 bucks?
JERRY 50 bucks. That table over there, the three couples.
ELAINE OK, I don't wanna go over there and do it, and then come back here and find out there was some little loophole, like I didn't put mustard on it or something...
JERRY No, no tricks.
ELAINE Should I do it, George?
GEORGE For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the soup and blow.
ELAINE Alright, alright. Here, hold this. I'm doin' it.
ELAINE I know this sounds crazy, but the two men who are standing behind me are going to give me 50 bucks if I stand here and eat one of your eggrolls.
ELAINE I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.
PEOPLE_AT_TABLE What? What is she talking about? What did she say?
JERRY What happened?
ELAINE Did you see that?
GEORGE What were you doing?
ELAINE I offered them 25, they had no idea...
JERRY George, the phone's free.
GEORGE Alleluia.
GEORGE Excuse me, I was waiting here.
WOMAN_AT_PHONE Where? I didn't see you.
GEORGE I've been standing here for the last ten minutes!
WOMAN Well I won't be long.
GEORGE That's not the point. The point is I was here first.
WOMAN Well if you were here first, you'd be holding the phone.
GEORGE You know, we're living in a society! We're supposed to act in a civilized way.
GEORGE Does she care? No. Does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity over the problems of a fellow individual? No. No. A resounding no!
GUY Hey, sorry I took so long.
GEORGE Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about it.
ELAINE How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this crazy? I'm gonna walk around, see what dishes look good.
JERRY I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think he bought that?
GEORGE Yeah, well, he probably bought it.
JERRY So what happened with Tatiana?
GEORGE I shouldn't even tell you this.
JERRY Come on...
GEORGE Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment.
JERRY I'm with you.
GEORGE Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove. You understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool around, and it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to momentarily... extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, I know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm going to need...
JERRY This could only happen to you.
GEORGE So I finally stop and say, "Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left".
JERRY You said this to her after.
GEORGE No. During.
JERRY Oh, boy.
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY Wow! So...?
GEORGE So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman, and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, and she's still on the phone.
ELAINE I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never coming back here again.
JERRY Who is that woman?!
ELAINE Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? Remember, it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a delicious and exciting adventure? And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them to fill up the trough.
GEORGE She's off.
ELAINE Jerry, talk to that guy again.
JERRY What am I gonna say?
ELAINE Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we're late.
MR._COHEN Hey, what stinks in here?
BRUCE Mr. Cohen! Haven't seen you for a couple of weeks.
MR._COHEN Well, I've been looking for a better place.
BRUCE Better place... Want a table?
MR._COHEN No, just bring me a plate and I'll eat here.
BRUCE Give him a plate and you eat here... Come on, I give you a table.
JERRY Excuse me... we've been waiting here. Now, I KNOW we were ahead of that guy, he just came in.
BRUCE Oh no, Mr. Cohen always here.
ELAINE He's always here? What does that mean? What does that mean?
BRUCE Oh, Mr. Cohen, very nice man. He live on Park Avenue.
ELAINE Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going on here?!
GEORGE She's not there. She left. She must've waited and left because those people wouldn't get off the phone.
JERRY Didja leave a message?
GEORGE Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. I better tell him I'm expecting a call.
ELAINE Oh, Jerry, here comes that woman...
JERRY Where do I know her?
LORRAINE Hello, Jerry!
JERRY Heeeeyyyy... How you doin'?
LORRAINE How is everything?
JERRY Good, good, good... What's goin' on?
LORRAINE Oh, working hard. And you?
JERRY Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing... whatever.
LORRAINE You haven't been around in a while.
JERRY I know, I know... Well, you know.
LORRAINE You should come by.
JERRY Definitely. I plan to, I'm not just saying that.
ELAINE Hi, I'm Elaine.
LORRAINE Lorraine. Catalano.
JERRY I'm sorry, Lorraine, this is Elaine...
LORRAINE Well it was nice seeing you, Jerry. And nice meeting you.
ELAINE Oh, nice to meet you too, Lorraine!
JERRY Oh my god, Lorraine... that's Lorraine from my uncle's office. I'm in big, big trouble.
ELAINE The one you broke the plans with tonight?
JERRY Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's gonna see him tomorrow and tell him she saw me here tonight. He's gonna tell his wife, his wife's gonna call my mother. Oh, this is bad, you don't know, the chain reaction of calls this is gonna set off. New York, Long Island, Florida, it's like the Bermuda Triangle. Unfortunately, nobody ever disappears. My uncle to my aunt, my aunt to my mother, my mother to my uncle...
JERRY ...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me.
ELAINE You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in over with. It's just a movie.
JERRY Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8 from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked. The worst movie ever made!
JERRY Hey, I got news for you, if we're making this movie, we gotta get a table immediately.
ELAINE Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip him some money.
JERRY In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?
ELAINE Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks.
GEORGE 20 bucks? Isn't that excessive?
ELAINE Well what do you want to give him, change?
GEORGE It's more than the meal!
JERRY Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways.
GEORGE Alright. 7,7, 6. I'm not gonna eat that much!
JERRY I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it?
GEORGE Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good at these things, I get flustered. Once I tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby, I almost got arrested.
ELAINE I guess it's you, Jer.
JERRY Me? What about you?
ELAINE Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing.
JERRY The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress in the world of bribery, can they?
ELAINE Give me the money.
ELAINE How's it going'?
BRUCE Very busy.
ELAINE Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down.
BRUCE Very good specials tonight.
ELAINE If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really appreciate it.
BRUCE What is your name?
ELAINE No no, I want to eat now!
BRUCE Yes, we have sea-bass dinner tonight, very fresh.
ELAINE Here, take this. I'm starving. Take it! Take it!
BRUCE Dennison, 4! Your table is ready.
ELAINE No no, no, I want that table. I want that table! Oh, come on, did you see that? What was that? He took the money, he didn't give us a table.
JERRY You lost the 20.
ELAINE Well, how could he do that?
GEORGE You didn't make it clear.
ELAINE Make it clear?
JERRY What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright, let me get the money back. Excuse me. I realize, this is extremely embarrassing, my friend here apparently made a mistake.
BRUCE Your name?
JERRY Seinfeld.
BRUCE Yeah, Seinfeld 4!
JERRY No no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair?
BRUCE Oh yes, yes. Very beautiful girl, very beautiful. Is your girlfriend?
JERRY Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really not relevant here.
BRUCE Relationships are difficult. It's very hard to stay together-
JERRY Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be?
BRUCE Oh. In about five, ten minutes.
GEORGE So?
JERRY There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.
ELAINE So when are we gonna eat?
JERRY Five, ten minutes.
GEORGE We should have left earlier. I told you.
JERRY I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.
ELAINE Oh, well I have to eat.
JERRY Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab.
ELAINE Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a cab?
JERRY We'll eat it in the movie.
ELAINE Oh, who do you think you're going? Do you think that they have big picnic tables there?
JERRY Well what do you suggest?
ELAINE I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em down.
JERRY I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, it's in the opposite direction, let's just eat popcorn or something.
BRUCE Cartwright?
ELAINE I can't have popcorn for dinner!
BRUCE Cartwright?
ELAINE I have to eat!
JERRY So they have hotdogs there.
ELAINE Oh, movie hotdogs! I rather lick the food off the floor.
GEORGE I can't go anywhere, I have to wait here for Tatiana's call. Let me just check.
GEORGE Excuse me, I'm expecting a call. Costanza?
BRUCE Yeah, I just got a call. I yell 'Cartwright! Cartwright!', just like that. Nobody came up, I hang up.
GEORGE Well, was it for Costanza or...
BRUCE Yes, yes, that's it. Nobody answered.
GEORGE Well was it a woman?
BRUCE Yeah, yeah. I tell her you not here, she said curse word, I hang up.
GEORGE She called. He yelled Cartwright. I missed her.
JERRY Who's Cartwright?
GEORGE I'm Cartwright!
JERRY You're not Cartwri-
GEORGE Of course I'm not Cartwright! Look, why don't you two just go to the movies all by yourselves, I'm not in the mood.
ELAINE Well me neither, I'm goin' to 'Skyburger'.
JERRY So You're not going?
ELAINE You don't need us.
JERRY Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to, strangers? Eh, I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.
GEORGE Should we tell him we're leaving?
ELAINE What for? Let's just get out of here.
BRUCE Seinfeld, 4?
JERRY Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof of that is cannibalism. Cannibalism, what do they say, I mean, they're eating and, you know, "This is good, who is this? I like this person". You know, I mean, I would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very deep sleep, you know what I mean? I would think, you'd be like, "Who is that? Who's there? Who's there? Is somebody there? What do you want? What do you want? You look hungry, are you hungry? Get out of here!"
JERRY Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station? Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, ok I can be down there in like a half hour. Bye.
KRAMER What's the problem?
JERRY This you're not goin' to believe. The New York Public Library says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971 and never returned it.
KRAMER Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day for 20 years. It's going to be $50,000
JERRY It doesn't work like that.
KRAMER If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000
JERRY It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly because I was with Sherry Becker. She waore this orange dress. It was the first time I ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. And then one day ...
JERRY That orange dress is burned in my memory
KRAMER Oh, memory burn.
JERRY I wonder what ever happened to her.
KRAMER How did they ever find you?
JERRY Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is completely ridiculous.
JERRY It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library
KRAMER You know I never got a library card.
JERRY Coming down.
KRAMER It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a quarter, ooh,
JERRY I gotta go to the library. You want to go?
KRAMER Yeah
KRAMER The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that Dewey guy really cleaned up on that deal.
JERRY Where's George
READER Shhh.
KRAMER Tryin' to save a quarter.
JERRY I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them for my house.
JERRY This woman's completely ignoring me.
KRAMER Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster. ... Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was a schoolgirl. There was a boy It didn't work out. Now she needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding. She needs a little Kramer.
JERRY Eventually a little shot of penicillin
LIBRARIAN Yes?
JERRY Yes I called before. I got his notice in the mail.
LIBRARIAN Oh, Tropic of Cancer, Henry Miller, Uh, this case has been turned over to our library investigation officer Mr. Bookman.
KRAMER Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?
LIBRARIAN It's true.
KRAMER That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone.
LIBRARIAN Lt. Bookman has been working here for 25 years so I think he's heard all the jokes.
JERRY Can I speak with this Bookman?
LIBRARIAN Just a second.
GEORGE Jerry,
JERRY What?
GEORGE I think I saw him. I think it's him.
JERRY Who?
GEORGE Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obsenities and doing some calesthetics routine
JERRY Yeah.
KRAMER yeah
GEORGE I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our High School.
READER Shhh.
JERRY Are you sure?
GEORGE He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but I think it's him.
JERRY George got him fired. He squealed on him.
KRAMER Ooh tattle tale
GEORGE I didn't tattle
READER Shh Shh
KRAMER What did this guy do? What happened?
GEORGE There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it.
KRAMER Oh come on, You can tell me.
GEORGE Some other time.
KRAMER What tonight?
KRAMER Y'know I never figured you for a squealer.
JERRY Oh, he sang like a canary.
LIBRARIAN Mr. Bookman's not here.
JERRY Not here? Why was I told to come down here?
LIBRARIAN He'll be out all afternoon on a case.
KRAMER He's out on a case? He actually goes out on cases?
JERRY Well what am I supposed to do now?
LIBRARIAN I'll have Mr. Bookman get in touch with you.
JERRY All right Thanks. Come on lets go
GEORGE Let's see if it's Hayman?
KRAMER Hey, uh, I'll see you boys later. So uh, what's a guy got to do around here to get a library card?
ELAINE Where's Karen?
SECRETARY She went to pick up lunch.
ELAINE She didn't ask me what I wanted.
SECRETARY She must have forgot.
ELAINE How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years? Is there something you're not telling me because I'm getting a really weird vibe. Is Lippman getting rid of me? It's OK I won't say anything.
SECRETARY I don't know anything.
ELAINE Ah, you don't know anything. You see, "I don't know anything", means there's something to know. If you really didn't know anything you would have said "You're crazy."
ELAINE Oh, hi Mr. Lippman.
LIPPMAN Elaine,
ELAINE Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that , um, biography of Columbus, I gave you?
LIPPMAN Yes I did. Yes I did. ... Maureen this water is still too cold.
ELAINE It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth.
ELAINE I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything I recommend. And then that lunch thing.
JERRY So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal!
ELAINE What do you know. You've never worked in an office. See, you've worked in an office. Jerry thinks I'm over reacting but you understand, ... lunch!
GEORGE I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does it?
ELAINE What did he do?
GEORGE He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, "Costanza" He'd say, "Can't stand ya". "Can't stand ya" ... He made me smell my own gym socks once.
JERRY I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps were hangin' down by his ,...
GEORGE Ok, Ok, I never even had him for gym.
JERRY I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from an exhumed corpse.
GEORGE Little baked beans
JERRY Echh
ELAINE Come on tell me what happened.
GEORGE Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually failed me in gym...me!
GEORGE ... Those spastic shnitzer twins ...
HEYMAN Can't stand ja ... Can't stand ja
GEORGE Yes, Mr. Hayman
HEYMAN Your underwear was stick'n out of your shorts during gym class.
GEORGE Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
HEYMAN Boxer shorts, ha? Well what brand?
GEORGE I'm not really sure, I...
HEYMAN Well let's take a look. gets a wedgie
GEORGE He gave me a wedgie.
JERRY He got fired the next day.
ELAINE Why do they call it a wedgie?
GEORGE Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in..
JERRY They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head. Very rare.
ELAINE Boys are sick.
JERRY Well what do girls do ?
ELAINE We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder. guy who ruined his life.
KRAMER Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman from the library he's waiting for ya.
JERRY What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where you go in you can take out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you're done. It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. That's what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And that's why everybody kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... I'll bring it back late. ... Oh, what are you going to do? Charge me a nickel?
JERRY Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened out. Would you like a cup of tea?
BOOKMAN You got any coffee?
JERRY Coffee?
BOOKMAN Yeah. Coffee.
JERRY No, I don't drink coffee.
BOOKMAN Yeah, you don't drink coffee? How about instant coffee?
JERRY No, I don't have--
BOOKMAN You don't have any instant coffee?
JERRY Well, I don't normally--
BOOKMAN Who doesn't have instant coffee?
JERRY I don't.
BOOKMAN You buy a jar of Folger's Crystals, you put it in the cupboard, you forget about it. Then later on when you need it, it's there. It lasts forever. It's freeze-dried. Freeze-dried Crystals.
JERRY Really? I'll have to remember that.
BOOKMAN You took this book out in 1971.
JERRY Yes, and I returned it in 1971.
BOOKMAN Yeah, '71. That was my first year on the job. Bad year for libraries. Bad year for America. Hippies burning library cards, Abby Hoffman telling everybody to steal books. I don't judge a man by the length of his hair or the kind of music he listens to. Rock was never my bag. But you put on a pair of shoes when you walk into the New York Public Library, fella.
JERRY Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very specifically.
BOOKMAN You're a comedian, you make people laugh.
JERRY I try.
BOOKMAN You think this is all a big joke, don't you?
JERRY No, I don't.
BOOKMAN I saw you on T.V. once; I remembered your name--from my list. I looked it up. Sure enough, it checked out. You think because you're a celebrity that somehow the law doesn't apply to you, that you're above the law?
JERRY Certainly not.
BOOKMAN Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the one that says "New York Public Library"? Well that may not mean anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot. Flashy, making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. What's this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Well, let me give you a hint, junior. Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't he deserve better? Look. If you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You and is over. Y'got seven days, Seinfeld. That is one week!
KRAMER What's wrong?
MARIAN It's Bookman the library cop.
KRAMER So I didn't do anything wrong.
MARIAN I'm supposed to be atwork. I could get fired. I shouldn't have come here.
KRAMER Why don't ya' leave?
MARIAN I can't.
JERRY No way I'm payin' that! I returned that book I n 1971. I have a witness Sherry Becker. She wore an orange dress. She gave me a piece of black jack gum. It's a licorice gum. What do ya' think of next I remember it. Becker, ... Becker, ...
SHERRY Kevin went to a public school, he's the 14 year old? We were gonna' send Marsha to a private school. Cause in some way they don't learn ... enough ... I think.
JERRY So Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library?
SHERRY I remember it like it was yesterday. It was a Friday afternoon. I wore a purple dress.
JERRY Purple? Ya' sure it wasn't orange?
SHERRY Positive. And I was chewin' Dentyne. I always chewed dentyne. Remember Jerry? Dentyne?
JERRY No Black Jack?
SHERRY Licorice gum? Never! We were reading pasages to each other from that Henry Miller book,
JERRY Tropic of Cancer.
SHERRY No, Tropic of Capricorn
JERRY Tropic of Capricorn?
SHERRY Rememba? What holds the world togetha' ... "As I have learned from bitter experience is sexual intercourse ."
JERRY Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of them. We read from Tropic of Capricorn. I was all set to return Tropic of Cancer. And then ...
JERRY Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
GEORGE Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it
JERRY Ok, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene.
SHERRY Where ya' going?
JERRY It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. I've got to go. It was George!
KRAMER Read another poem.
MARIAN Pressed chest fleshed out west Might be the saviour or a garden pest.
KRAMER Wow, that is great. You should be published.
KRAMER You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's closed.
MARIAN Oh, yeah. You don't have to be quiet. Listen to the echo: Hello!
KRAMER Hello!
MARIAN Hello!
KRAMER Hello!
MARIAN Hello!
BOOKMAN Hello!
MARIAN Mr. Bookman.
BOOKMAN I remember when the librarian was a much older woman: Kindly, discreet, unattractive. We didn't know anything about her private life. We didn't want to know anything about her private life. She didn't have library closes at five o'clock, no exceptions. This is your final warning. Got that, kewpie-doll?
ELAINE Lippman want's to see me in his office see me! That can't be good
JERRY Maybe you're getting' a raise.
ELAINE Maybe I'm getting' a wedgie.
ELAINE What?
GEORGE It's George
ELAINE George is on his way up.
JERRY Wait 'til I tell him about the book.
KRAMER sobs
ELAINE Are you Ok? What? What?
KRAMER It's marion's poetry. I can't take it
ELAINE Remember that biography I recommended? My boss hated it. .
JERRY I'm right here.
ELAINE Remember that Columbus book?
JERRY Columbus, Euro trash.
GEORGE Well, it's definetly him.
ELAINE Him? Him who?
GEORGE Him who? Hayman him.
ELAINE Hayman The gym teacher? You found him?
GEORGE Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. I sat down next to him. He smelled like the locker room after that game against Erasmus
JERRY That was double overtime.
GEORGE So I said, "Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK, ... " He doesn't move. So I said uh, "Can't stand ya'", "Can't stand ya'" He turns and smiles, the little baked bean teeth. I get up to run away, but something was holding me back. It was Heyman. He had my underwear. There I was on the steps of the 42nd St. library , a grown man, getting a wedgie.
ELAINE At least it wasn't atomic.
GEORGE It was.
JERRY So Georgie Boy, guess what happened to Tropic of Cancer
GEORGE How should I know?
JERRY Because I gave it to you.
GEORGE Me?
JERRY Yesah, think. Don't you remember you kept begging me to see it then finally I agreed. You were supposed to return it. I met you in the gym locker room.
GEORGE The locker room!
JERRY Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
GEORGE Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it tomorrow, no problem.
JERRY All right, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene.
HEYMAN Can't Stand Ya'.
GEORGE Yes Mr. Hayman.
HEYMAN Your underwear was stick'n out of your shorts during gym class.
GEORGE Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
HEYMAN Boxer shorts, ha? Well what brand?
GEORGE I'm not really sure, I...
HEYMAN Well let's take a look.
JERRY Anyway, I hope there's no hard feelings.
BOOKMAN Hard feelings? What do you know about hard feelings? Y'ever have a man die in your arms? Y'ever kill somebody?
JERRY What is your problem?
BOOKMAN What's my problem? Punks like you, that's my problem. And you better not screw up again Seinfeld, because if you do, I'll be all over you like a pitbull on a poodle.
JERRY That is one tough monkey! So you were saying?
ELAINE Oh? So, I took your suggestion and I gave my boss Marion's poems. The ones that affected Kramer so much.
JERRY Oh, beautiful did he like them?
ELAINE No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!
JERRY Was he out there?
GEORGE Na, he's gone. I wonder what happened to him.
JERRY I guess we'll never know.
HEYMAN Can't stand ya, Can't stand ya.
JERRY It was a weird school day, you know what I mean because it kind of like started of kind of normal. You have like English, Geometry, Social Studies and then suddenly you're like in Lord of The Flies for 40 minutes you know you're hangin' from a rope. You have hardly any clothes on. Teachers are yellin' at ya' "Where's your jock strap?" Ya' know and kids are throwin' dodge balls at you. You're tryin' to survive ... Then its History, Science, Language. There's something off in the entire flow of that day.
JERRY Ow. Stupid fold-out! Why'd they put the bar in the middle of the bed?
JERRY Hello?
ELAINE Hi Jerry.
JERRY Elaine? Wh..what's going on?
ELAINE I was thinking, I mean, I'm not really doing that much this weekend, and I thought, well, huh, what the hell, maybe I'll come down there and hang out a little.
JERRY You wanna hang out here, at phase two of the Pines of Mar Gables?
ELAINE Well, it's just two hours by plane...
JERRY Gee, I dunno what to tell you. There is a beep from Elaine's phone.
ELAINE Dammit! I got another call. Uh, hang on, don't hang up Jerry.
ELAINE Yeah?
GEORGE Elaine! You have got to get me Marisa Tomei's phone number!
ELAINE Okay, George, I am on the other line. I promise you, I'll get you her number.
GEORGE Yeahhh.
ELAINE Goodbye.
ELAINE Hi.
JERRY Hi.
ELAINE So, what d'you think?
JERRY Uh, I don't think so.
ELAINE Oh.
JERRY I'll be back on Monday.
ELAINE Well, if you need that ride, just uhm, gimme a call. Heh. I can meet you at the gate, Jer.
JERRY Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Alright, I'll see you.
ELAINE Jerry? Jerry?
JERRY Yeah.
ELAINE Bye.
JERRY Bye.
KRAMER Hello.
JOHN Hello, Mister Kramer? This is John Hanaran, from Con Ed.
KRAMER Ohh, it's Hanaran now, is it?
JOHN Yeah. We've had some reports of power surges in your building. It seems some jokers were up on the roof, and they must've damaged some of the wires.
KRAMER Oh, you don't say.
JOHN Yeah. Either way, we need to get into your apartment and do a safety check.
KRAMER Ohh, you're good. You are really good.
JOHN What're you talking about?
GEORGE Marisa Tomei! I, just spoke to Marisa Tomei! And I wasn't even that nervous.
GEORGE You know, I can't remember the last time I called a woman without being nervous. I, usually, I'm pacing all over the room, I'm...
ELAINE Okay, well that's all the time we have for today. Why don't we pick up with this next week?
GEORGE Hey, where you going?
ELAINE I got stuff to do.
GEORGE What? You can't leave yet.
ELAINE Why not?
GEORGE We have to discuss my alibi.
ELAINE Alibi? What does that have to do with me?
GEORGE I usually spend Saturday afternoons with Susan. She's gonna want to know what I'm doing. I can't use Jerry, he's in Florida.
ELAINE Oh, so you wanna say you were with me?
GEORGE Yes.
ELAINE Puh. Okay, fine. You were with me.
GEORGE Wait a second, wait. Why are we together?
ELAINE What is the difference?
GEORGE Because, if you ever see her and it comes up, we have to be in sync. Hmm?
GEORGE Okay. Now, why do I have to see you?
ELAINE Ah! Because, I'm going to the dentist, and I'm afraid, and I want you to go with me.
GEORGE It's no good.
ELAINE Okay. Fine.
GEORGE What?
ELAINE I don't like the way you just rejected my suggestion.
GEORGE Hey, hey, let's not get so defensive here. This is a give and take process.
ELAINE I thought that my suggestion was good. And, I think you could've been a little more tactful.
GEORGE Okay, look. We've never worked together on a lie. Now, you don't understand how I work. I have a certain way of working. Jerry and I have worked together a few times. He knows how I work. It's not a personal thing, y'know? We're just trying to come up with the best possible lie. That's what this is all about.
ELAINE Okay.
GEORGE Alright?
ELAINE Okay.
GEORGE Okay.
ELAINE Fine.
GEORGE Good.
ELAINE Fine, fine, fine.
GEORGE Okay. How about this?
ELAINE What?
GEORGE You are having problems with your boyfriend and I am meeting you to discuss the situation.
ELAINE I don't have a boyfriend.
GEORGE She doesn't know that. We say that you do.
ELAINE Ech.
GEORGE It's good. Believe me.
ELAINE I thought my idea was just as good.
GEORGE The dentist thing?
ELAINE Yeah, right. The dentist thing.
GEORGE Alright, the dentist thing was not good.
ELAINE Okay, alright. What's his name? Who is he?
GEORGE Art Vandelay.
ELAINE Art Vandelay? This is my boyfriend?
GEORGE That's your boyfriend.
ELAINE What does he do?
GEORGE He's an importer.
ELAINE Just imports? No exports?
GEORGE He's an importer-exporter. Okay?
ELAINE Okay. So, I'm dating Art Vandelay. What is the problem we're discussing?
GEORGE Yes. Yes.
ELAINE Yi-yi-yi.
ELAINE Ah! How 'bout this? How about, he's thinking of quitting the exporting, and just focussing in on the importing. And this is causing a problem, because, why not do both?
ELAINE Oh, what? You don't like that suggestion either?
GEORGE It's very complicated.
ELAINE You know, it seems to me that it's all you, and none of my ideas are getting in. You know, I mean, you just know it all and I am Miss Stupid. Right?
MORTY What're you doing? Are you making coffee?
HELEN Yeah.
MORTY Well, maybe you better make a pot of tea, too.
HELEN Morty, you're driving me crazy.
MORTY Look, I don't want anything to go wrong. If this woman votes to impeach me, I'll be a laughing stock.
HELEN You wanna drive a Cadillac? Expect to pay the consequences.
MORTY There she is.
MORTY Hello. Hello, Mrs Choate.
HELEN Oh, come in, come in. May I take your coat.
MRS._CHOATE No, no. I prefer to wear it. Nobody's taking my coat.
HELEN Ah, how 'bout a cup of coffee or something?
MRS._CHOATE Coffee? Ach. I'll take hot water with lemon, if you have it.
HELEN I'll see. Have a seat. That's a lovely scarf you're wearing. Where did you get it?
MRS._CHOATE Ahh, they're a dime a dozen. Jerry enters.
HELEN Oh, hi Jerry. Mrs Choate, this is my son, Jerry.
JERRY Gimme that rye!
MRS._CHOATE Stop it. Let go. Help! Someone, help!
JERRY Shut up, you old bag!
MRS._CHOATE Thief! Stop him! Stop him, he's got my rye!
JERRY Nice to meet you.
MRS._CHOATE Hello.
MORTY Jerry lives in New York. You just came from New York, didn't you?
MRS._CHOATE Yeah. I was visiting my daughter, and I'll never go back. The crime there is just terrible. Do you know I got mugged for a marble rye, right on the street?
HELEN Oh, that's terrible. They stole a rye? Why would they steal a rye?
MORTY That's what the city's turning into. They'll steal anything.
MRS._CHOATE They're like savages.
JERRY Yeah, there's some sickos out there.
MRS._CHOATE You look very familiar. Have we ever met?
JERRY You ever go to Camp Tiyoga?
HELEN Maybe you've seen him on television.
MORTY Jerry's a comedian.
MRS._CHOATE Naw, I don't watch tv.
JERRY Well, it was nice meeting you.
MORTY Jerry, don't go.
JERRY Ah, I think I'll go.
MRS._CHOATE So, Morty, what's this all about? What d'you want?
SUSAN Hey, where're you going?
GEORGE Wha..? I didn't tell you? I gotta go meet Elaine.
SUSAN Elaine? What for?
GEORGE I don't know. She..She's having some problems with this guy she's seeing.
SUSAN I didn't even know she was dating anyone.
GEORGE Yeah, yeah. She's seeing this guy, Art Vandelay.
SUSAN So what does he do?
GEORGE He's an importer-exporter.
SUSAN What kind of problems are they having?
GEORGE Well, he uh, he wants to uh, quit the exporting and uh, focus just on the importing. And it's a problem, because she thinks the exporting is as important as the importing.
SUSAN Are you having an affair with Elaine?
GEORGE Right. C'mon! I'm having an affair with Elaine?! If I was having an affair with Elaine, I wouldn't tell you I'm going to see Elaine. I would make up some other person to tell you I was gonna go see, and then I would go see Ela..Elaine.
SUSAN Huh?
NICK I'll get you! I'll get you Kramer! You won't get away with this!
MORTY Alright, are you ready to eat?
HELEN Oh, right, let's go. Jerry, let's go, it's time to eat. We're going to dinner.
JERRY Dinner? W..What time is it?
HELEN It's four-thirty.
JERRY Four-thirty? Who eats dinner at four-thirty?
MORTY By the time we sit down, it'll be quarter to five.
JERRY I don't understand why we have to eat now.
HELEN We gotta catch the early-bird. It's only between four-thirty and six.
MORTY Yeah. They give you a tenderloin, a salad and a baked potato, for four-ninety-five. You know what that cost you after six?
JERRY Can't we eat at a decent hour? I'll treat, okay?
HELEN You're not buying us dinner.
JERRY I'm not force-feeding myself a steak at four-thirty to save a coupla bucks, I'll tell you that!
HELEN Alright, we'll wait. But it's unheard of.
GEORGE ...So, anyway, if you think about it, manure is not really that bad a word. I mean, it's 'newer', which is good, and a 'ma' in front of it, which is also good. Ma-newer , right?
MARISA You're so right. I never thought of it like that. Manure. 'Ma' and the 'newer'.
MARISA Did you just make that up?
GEORGE What, you think I'm doing material here?
MARISA No, no. It's hard to believe anyone could be so spontaneously funny.
GEORGE And I'm a little tired.
MARISA So, tell me, how is it that a man like you, so bald, and so quirky and funny, how is it you're not taken?
GEORGE Well, Marisa. See, the thing is... I'm sort of engaged.
MARISA What?
GEORGE I'm, you know, engaged.
JERRY Hey look, there's a spot right in front.
MORTY Always, Jerry. Always.
DORIS Was that delicious or what?
JACK Where you gonna get a better meal than that?
DORIS Better than Danny's.
JACK Danny's? C'mon!
MORTY Hello Jack.
HELEN Doris.
DORIS Hello, hello.
JERRY Jack.
DORIS Hello, Jerry.
JERRY Hi Doris.
JACK Hello Morty. Well, missed the early bird.
MORTY Yeah, so?
JACK Must be nice to have that kind of money.
JACK Bernie, look who's eating at six o'clock. Your suddenly well-to-do president. But, you enjoy your last meal in office. Tomorrow, they kick you out, you'll have plenty of time to drive around in your Cadillac.
MORTY They're not kicking me out. You don't have the votes.
JACK That's what you think.
MORTY We'll see.
JACK Yes, we will.
JERRY Awright, let's eat already.
ELAINE Hi, Susan.
SUSAN Hi.
ELAINE Hi. Come in, come in. Have a seat.
SUSAN Uh, Elaine, I have to ask you a question.
ELAINE Oh, sure.
SUSAN Are you having an affair with George?
ELAINE Wha...?! Ha ha ha. Ha, no.
ELAINE Don't be ridiculous! I mean, why would anyone wanna sleep...
ELAINE ...Well, obviously... You know... Ap..ap, Chu... Why would you think I was having an affair with George?
SUSAN Ohh, because he said that he had to talk with you earlier about some problem that you were having.
ELAINE Yeah, yeah, I did have to talk with him. I definitely had to talk with him. Having a problem with my boyfriend.
SUSAN Art Vandelay?
ELAINE Yeah, Art Vandelay.
SUSAN I'm sorry. I feel like an idiot.
ELAINE No, no. Huh-hu-hu. It's okay.
SUSAN Oh, just forget that we ever talked. Okay?
ELAINE It is so forgotten.
SUSAN Alright. Susan moves toward the door.
ELAINE Okay. Okay, no problem.
SUSAN So, was George helpful at all?
ELAINE Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, he was very helpful. Uhm, because, you know, Art and I were getting into this whole thing about his business. Uhm, you know he's an importer-exporter.
SUSAN Yeah.
ELAINE Uhm, George felt that I was too adamant in my stand that Art should focus on the exporting and forget about the importing.
SUSAN Wait a minute. I thought that Art wanted to give up the exporting.
ELAINE What'd I say?
SUSAN The importing.
ELAINE I did. Uh...
SUSAN So, what does he uh, import?
ELAINE Uh... chips.
SUSAN Oh. What kinda chips?
ELAINE Potato.
SUSAN Ah.
ELAINE Some corn.
SUSAN And what does he export?
ELAINE Diapers.
SUSAN I'm sorry for bothering you.
ELAINE Oh, no, it's okay.
ELAINE Okay.
ELAINE C'mon, George, pick up. Oh, pick up. Oh, pick up.
GEORGE Hi.
SUSAN Hi. So, George, what does Art Vandelay import?
GEORGE Matches? Long matches.
HERB ...There she is. Okay, if I can have your attention for a minute here. We're calling this emergency meeting of the board of phase two, to consider a motion of impeachment of our president, Morty Seinfeld.
MORTY Nervous, Jack?
JACK What for?
MORTY Because I have the votes.
MORTY Nice to see you, Mrs Choate.
MRS._CHOATE Hello, Morty.
HERB Building A. Are you for, or against, the motion to impeach?
RALPH What does that mean?
HERB It means, if you're for the motion, you're against Morty.
RALPH So why don't you say that?
HERB Hey, I'm running the meeting.
RALPH If you think so.
HERB Building A?
BUILDINGA For impeachment.
HERB Building B?
BUILDINGB Against impeachment.
HERB Building C?
BUILDINGC For impeachment.
HERB Building D?
MRS._CHOATE Against impeachment.
JACK I can't believe you got that old bag.
MRS._CHOATE Help! Someone help!
JERRY Shut up, you old bag!
MRS._CHOATE Oh, thief! Thief!
MRS._CHOATE It's him. It's your son. Now I know where I saw him. He stole my marble rye.
MORTY My son never stole anything. He's a good boy.
RALPH They should lock him up.
MRS._CHOATE Like father, like son. I change my vote. I vote to impeach!
BUILDINGB Me too. I change my vote.
HERB All those in favour, say aye.
ALL Aye.
HERB All opposed.
HERB The ayes have it. The motion passes.
HERB Morty Seinfeld, you are officially dismissed as condo president. As vice-president, Jack Klompus, in accordance with the phase two constitution, is hereby installed as president.
HERB Hear, hear, Jack.
NICK Alright, I know you're in there. I know you can hear me. You win, okay? You win. I can't do it any more. What d'you want from me? Apology? Alright, I'm sorry. There, I said it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I see now how we made you feel when we made you sit home waiting. I dunno why we do it. I guess maybe we just kind of enjoy taking advantage of people. Well, that's gonna change. From now on, no more 'nine to twelve', no more 'one to five'. We're gonna have appointments. Eleven o'clock is gonna mean eleven o'clock. And, if we can't make it, we're gonna call you, tell you why. For god's sakes, if a doctor can do it, why can't we? Anyway, that's it.
JERRY The bags are in the car, I guess we better go.
KRAMER I wouldn't walk over there.
JERRY Why not?
KRAMER It's the most dangerous part of the sidewalk. Cab hops a curb, wap! You've had your last egg sandwich.
JERRY What about over there? You know air conditioners fall out all the time.
KRAMER I'd much rather get hit by an 80 pound air conditioner than a two ton cab.
JERRY No, cab's comin' in right here Set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs, and a monkey to answer the door, I'm back in business.
KRAMER Much rather take it to the head, Like I did in '79.
JERRY You were livin' in the village then, right?
KRAMER Don't really remember.
ELAINE Toxic waste green.
JERRY That is disgusting.
ELAINE You know, revulsion has now become a valid form of attraction.
JERRY Well, then you're drivin' me wild.
ELAINE I had 'em done for the big Peterman bash I'm throwin'.
JERRY Oh, why you havin' a party?
ELAINE I drive my people hard, and then I reward them.
JERRY Like with dogs.
ELAINE Exactly.
GEORGE Party?
ELAINE Yeah.
GEORGE Food?
ELAINE Uh huh.
GEORGE Bar?
ELAINE Yeah.
GEORGE George?
JERRY He's gonna show up anyway.
ELAINE George, I just don't want you interfering.
GEORGE How could I possibly interfere?
JERRY Isn't that what Jack Ruby said?
GEORGE Oh yeah. These are fantastic, fantastic. You know, I'd love to get a jump on the next batch, where do you come out? She's been ignoring this section all night. Quesadilla?
ANNA No thanks.
GEORGE My name is George.
ANNA Anna. I don't recall seeing you around the office. Do you work in the mail room?
GEORGE No, I'm a friend of Elaine Benes.
ANNA Oh. Excuse me.
GEORGE So...
MAN How 'bout leading us in a toast?
ELAINE Oh sure. Hey guys, I wanna make a toast. Um... Here's to us who wish us well, and those who don't can go to hell... All right, who's dancin'? C'mon, who's dancin'? You want me to get it started? I'll get it started. Whew!
GEORGE Sweet Fancy Moses!
KRAMER You get the tickets?
JERRY Who wants two? Special sneak preview of Death Blow.
KRAMER Death Blow: When someone tries to blow you up, not because of who you are, but for different reasons altogether. Jerry, do you think you can get an extra ticket for my friend Brody?
JERRY Kramer, do you know what I had to go through to get these?
KRAMER Yeah, I know, but he's a big fan of the genre. You know I'd consider it a personal favor to me.
JERRY Yeah I guess I do owe you.
KRAMER Uh, listen, do you want me to stay here until George gets up?
JERRY No, I'm okay.
KRAMER There's no problem, really.
JERRY I'm fine. How was the party?
GEORGE Food was good.
JERRY So I didn't miss anything?
GEORGE Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. Have you ever seen Elaine dance?
JERRY Elaine danced?
GEORGE It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.
JERRY Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?
GEORGE What, you mean you know about this?
JERRY For some time. It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away.
GEORGE Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit rock bottom.
JERRY And by then you've lost interest.
GEORGE Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my father's car. '68 GTO.
JERRY What made him get that thing?
GEORGE During that period when my folks were separated he went a little crazy.
JERRY Not a very long trip.
KRAMER Brody's in.
JERRY I don't even have the extra ticket yet.
KRAMER Well, you better get on the horn.
ELAINE I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff completely lost respect for me.
JERRY How could that be?
ELAINE Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it could have something to do with the party?
JERRY No, George was there, he said he had a great time.
ELAINE Oh, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related.
JERRY Oh, what are you talkin' about?
ELAINE He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host company, and the next thing you know, the entire staff's infected.
JERRY Now you're talkin' crazy!
ELAINE All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me. What is it?
JERRY Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'.
ANNA You have a minute to approve some copy?
ELAINE Oh yeah, sure, sure. So, did ya have a good time at the party last night?
ANNA It was a real... kick.
ELAINE Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George?
ANNA As a matter of fact I did.
ELAINE Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance from him.
ANNA Why? He seems harmless.
ELAINE Oh he's not. He's very harmful.
ANNA Really?
ELAINE Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's one of the worst seeds I've ever seen.
ANNA And you two are friends?
ELAINE Yeah, we're good friends.
GEORGE So this Anna called me from out of the blue.
JERRY Really? I thought you were rebuffed.
GEORGE With extreme prejudice.
JERRY Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.
GEORGE No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine said I was one of the worst seeds she'd ever seen.
JERRY Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a phone call. Seems Elaine's made you the bad boy. And Anna digs the bad boy.
GEORGE I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy.
JERRY You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend...
GEORGE Yes, yes...
JERRY The bad fiance, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk...
GEORGE Okay, the point is made.
JERRY The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... The bad tipper!
JERRY Half of show business is here.
KRAMER There's Brody. Brody! Over here.
BRODY Hey Kramer. And you must be Jerry. Thanks for the ticket.
JERRY That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.
BRODY It's for all of us. Is there a problem?
KRAMER Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry.
JERRY I'm a joke maker.
KRAMER All right, here we go, Death Blow.
JERRY Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?
KRAMER Relax, he does that all the time.
JERRY Does what?
KRAMER He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, huh?
JERRY May I see you outside for a moment please?
KRAMER But I want to--
JERRY Outside!
ELAINE Hey, have you seen Anna?
WORKER Uh, she just went to meet your friend George.
ELAINE To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?
WORKER The park, why?
ELAINE Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away from him, too!
JERRY What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?
KRAMER Well, it's a perfectly legitimate business.
JERRY It's not legitimate.
KRAMER It's a business.
JERRY Where did you meet this guy?
KRAMER He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on 94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pinochle--
JERRY Kramer.
KRAMER Man, we're missin' the Death Blow!
JERRY I don't believe this.
ANNA You know I'm not supposed to be talking to you.
GEORGE No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you?
ANNA No... a little. Nice car.
GEORGE Yeah, she's a sweet ride.
ANNA Is that your orthopedic back pillow?
GEORGE Maybe.
ANNA Well is it or isn't it?
GEORGE Guess not.
ELAINE Stay away from her.
GEORGE I didn't do nothin'.
ELAINE Get in the car.
ANNA But...
ELAINE You heard me young lady, get in the car. And you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff.
GEORGE Lighten up.
KRAMER Go get 'em, Death Blow! You okay?
BRODY Uh, I got a cramp.
KRAMER Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy.
BRODY Uh, there it goes again. Kramer, you gotta drive me home.
JERRY Hey, what is going on over there?
BRODY Jerry, finish shooting the movie for me.
JERRY Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing.
KRAMER Jerry, if the man is in pain...
JERRY Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right.
BRODY What are you some kind of tough guy?
KRAMER Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera.
JERRY All right, I'm takin' the camera.
KRAMER C'mon, let's go.
JERRY Oh man...
KRAMER Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow?
JERRY How was the rest of Death Blow?
KRAMER Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that Hawaiian guy had it comin' to him!
JERRY Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!
KRAMER He's quite a character, isn't he?
JERRY You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!
KRAMER I got it. Yep.
BRODY Brody.
KRAMER Come on up. It's Brody.
JERRY What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again.
KRAMER Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up and thank you.
JERRY What if I didn't do it right?
KRAMER It's your first time. He'll understand.
JERRY People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. Too many misunderstandings.
KRAMER Hey, Brody!
JERRY Hi.
BRODY Jerry, I have to talk to you about the tape.
JERRY Yeah.
BRODY I've never seen such beautiful work. You're a genius. The zoom-ins, the framing. I was enchanted.
JERRY Well, I did the best I could.
BRODY I got another project for you. It's a movie called Cry Cry Again. I was gonna give it to one of my other guys, but it's an arty movie and quite frankly, they don't have the sensibility.
BRODY May I use your phone?
KRAMER Uh yeah. It's under the couch.
KRAMER Look at you! You've got another gig!
JERRY I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this.
KRAMER But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy act. We're talkin' feature films.
JERRY We're talkin' federal crime here.
BRODY I'll expect that tape by three o'clock tomorrow. May I borrow this?
KRAMER Sure, do you need a glove?
BRODY Nah.
WORKER I pressed through the rushes and there, the native dancers whirled before me: limbs flailing, arms akimbo, feet kicking up dust...
ELAINE What?
ANNA Sorry, I got hung up.
ELAINE At Yankee Stadium?
ANNA This? It's mine.
ELAINE Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear.
ANNA He's not stocky.
ELAINE Who did that? Who did that?!?
KRAMER The French guy fell off the bike. Oh man, that's precious.
JERRY No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when you shot this?
KRAMER That's fine.
JERRY Do you even know what this scene is about?
KRAMER It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.
JERRY No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul.
KRAMER Wha? Where?
JERRY Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it.
KRAMER Nah, he's not going to know the difference.
JERRY I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted.
KRAMER So you'll do the movie?
JERRY I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers?
KRAMER Right here.
ELAINE Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing. What?
KRAMER This umpf thing.
ELAINE It's dancing.
KRAMER No, no. That ain't dancing, Sally.
ELAINE I dance fine.
KRAMER You stink.
ELAINE He doesn't know what he's talkin' about. Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right?
JERRY I forgot to make my bed.
ELAINE Jerry, do I stink?
JERRY All right, you're beyond stink.
ELAINE But I really enjoy dancing.
JERRY And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' trouble with your staff, not because of George.
ELAINE It's that bad?
JERRY Have you ever seen yourself? Ah, ah, please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. I'll be right back.
VOICE I have George Costanza still holding.
ELAINE George, hi. I have Anna here. There's something I wanna say to both of you.
GEORGE Yo, Anna.
ANNA Hi, George. What're you up to?
GEORGE You don't wanna know.
ELAINE Uh, well, listen. I feel really horrible about trying to keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize.
GEORGE What're you talkin' about?
ELAINE Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that you're a good and decent person.
GEORGE Pick up the phone, Elaine. Pick it up!
ELAINE I never should have given Anna the impression--
GEORGE Pick it up, pick it up!
ELAINE --that you're a bad seed, I mean, you're a fine seed.
GEORGE Elaine, get off the speaker!
ELAINE What?
GEORGE You are ruinin' everything.
ELAINE I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?
GEORGE Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult. I'm a difficult seed.
ELAINE George, I don't have time for this. Uh, Anna, do you wanna talk to George?
ANNA Um, no, I don't think so.
ELAINE No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya.
GEORGE I'm a bad man!
BRODY So where's the tape?
JERRY No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location.
BRODY I need the tape.
JERRY You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to talk to 'em.
BRODY Are you out of your mind?
JERRY Kramer...
KRAMER I know, Jerry. It's okay. Yeah, look, Brody. Uh, Jerry wants to do the bootleg. He's dyin' to do it. But if you don't make him happy, the work suffers. And then, nobody's happy.
BRODY Just shoot the damn thing so I can get it out on the street!
JERRY All right. That's it, I can't work like this.
KRAMER Jerry...
JERRY I'm off the project.
KRAMER Jerry!
BRODY I want the tape.
KRAMER Yeah.
GEORGE Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?
JERRY They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.
GEORGE Anna actually has respect for me now. It's all over.
JERRY Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money now. The sad thing is it's the kids that suffer.
KRAMER Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!
JERRY Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous...
GEORGE Did you say dangerous?
GEORGE I'm a bootlegger.
ANNA You're a what?
GEORGE I'm bootleggin' a movie, baby!
ANNA Isn't that illegal?
GEORGE I can do hard time for this one. And community service!
ANNA Is this your FiberCon?
GEORGE Get outta my way!
KRAMER Jerry, George got arrested.
JERRY What?
KRAMER Yeah. He went at the Beekman, he tried to land, but they cheesed him.
JERRY Oh now I see. Yeah.
BRODY Brody, I'm comin' up.
JERRY What're we gonna do?
KRAMER Well, I gotta give him something. Come on, where's that tape I shot?
JERRY I think that's it. Sweet fancy Moses!
KRAMER Jerry, she taped over the whole ending!
BRODY Where's the tape?
JERRY Uh, well. It, uh...
BRODY Is that it?
KRAMER Uh, yeah, yeah. Here it is, Brody. One copy of Cry Cry Again.
BRODY How'd it turn out?
KRAMER_AND_JERRY Uh... great.
KRAMER Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there.
JERRY Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears to be injured.
KRAMER Yeah, it's a disturbing image.
JERRY Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancer, you cry again.
ANNA It's all right, George. You'll just pay a fine and that'll be it.
GEORGE Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that?
ELAINE Anna...
ANNA Oh, Elaine, thanks for picking me up. I can explain everything.
ELAINE All right. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office.
FRANK Okay, where's my boy?
GEORGE Oh my God.
FRANK I'm sitting at home, reading a periodical, and this is the call I get? My son is a bootlegger?
GEORGE Ow! Dad...
FRANK Who put you up to this, was it her?
ELAINE All right. Wait a minute. I think you've got it backwards.
FRANK My George isn't clever enough to hatch a scheme like this.
ELAINE You got that right.
FRANK What the hell does that mean?
ELAINE It means whatever the hell you want it to mean.
FRANK You sayin' you want a piece of me?
ELAINE I could drop you like a bag of dirt.
FRANK You wanna piece of me? You got it!
JERRY But he's an old man, Elaine.
ELAINE Well, he wrote the check, and I cashed it.
JERRY Hey, it's the bootlegged Death Blow that I shot.
ELAINE Oh, Cry Cry Again, I wanna see that.
JERRY No you don't.
MAN You shot Death Blow?
JERRY Yeah.
MAN That was brilliant.
JERRY Thank you.
ELAINE You were big.
JERRY I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how are things at the office? Back to normal?
ELAINE Yeah, pretty much. Although I still get the vibe every once in a while.
JERRY I wouldn't worry about it.
JERRY The bus is the single stupidest, fattest, slowest, most despised vehicle on the road. Isn't it? You ever notice when you get behind the bus, people in your car go 'what are you doing? get away, come on.' The back of the bus is like an eclipse isn't it? people are just like 'the sun, where's the sun?' It's like this huge metal ass taking up the whole wind shield of your car. When it pulls out it even sounds like a fat uncle trying to get out of a sofa.
GEORGE It's just not good, it's not good.
JERRY It's not good.
GEORGE I'm bored. She's boring, I'm boring, we're both boring. We got out to eat, we both read newspapers.
JERRY Well at breakfast everybody reads.
GEORGE No. Lunch we read, dinner we read.
JERRY You read during lunch?
GEORGE Ya
JERRY Oh, well.
GEORGE There's nothing to talk about.
JERRY Ya, what's there to talk about.
GEORGE Well at least you and I are talking about how there's nothing to talk about.
JERRY Why don't you talk to her about how there's nothing to talk about?
GEORGE She knows there is nothing to talk about.
JERRY At least you'll be talking.
GEORGE Oh shut up.
AL Hey, look who's here.
JERRY Hey, Al.
GEORGE Hey, Al. How's it going?
AL Deeply in love. We have soo many things to talk about. Sometimes we'll talk all night, till the sun comes up so how about you?
GEORGE Oh I'm seeing someone, yes. You know her, Daphne Bower.
AL Great girl.
GEORGE We have no need to speak. We communicate with deep soulful looks.
JERRY Like Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower.
AL Oh did you hear about Fulton?
JERRY Ya.
AL I went by the hospital to see him a few days ago think he'd really like you to come visit.
JERRY Me?
AL Ya, he said he could use a good laugh.
GEORGE What about me?
AL He didn't mention you. This is my stop. Uh see ya.
GEORGE Ya
JERRY Ya, see ya.
GEORGE Deeply in love. If you can't say anything bad about a relationship, you shouldn't say anything at all.
JERRY Ya.
GEORGE I didn't even know Fulton was in the hospital.
JERRY Could use a good laugh. You know what kind of pressure that is? Come on, come with me.
GEORGE Na no, I'm not good in these situations. I can't hide my pity. I..I make em feel worse.
JERRY Oh, stop it.
GEORGE Ya and also I'm afraid that people in that state are finally going to tell me what they really think of me. You know they got nothing to lose what do they care?
JERRY So you're not gonna come?
GEORGE No but say hello for me.
KRAMER Hey!
JERRY Hey! Hey Mick.
MICKEY Hey Jerry.
KRAMER What's doing?
JERRY Nothing, what's doing with you?
KRAMER Same old, same old.
JERRY George this is Mickey.
GEORGE Hi, nice to meet you.
MICKEY Pleasure.
JERRY How's work going you guys?
MICKEY Lets not even talk about it.
GEORGE You got a job?
KRAMER Ya, Mickey. He hooked me up. We're stand-ins for the actors on 'All My Children.' Mickey, he's a stand-in for an eight year old kid and I stand in for the kids father.
MICKEY But I got a big problem. The kid I stand in for, he's growing. He was four feet last month, now he's like four-two and a half. He shot up two and a half inches. I can do four-two, four-three is a stretch, any higher than that and I'm gonna be out on my ass doing that paralegal crap.
JERRY How do you stop a kid from growing?
KRAMER I told you, you should offer him some cigarettes.
MICKEY I offered him cigarettes, but his stupid mother is hanging around. She won't let him have any.
KRAMER What about lifts?
MICKEY Out of the question.
GEORGE Can't you just switch with another Midget?
MICKEY It's little people, you got that?
KRAMER Easy Mickey, easy.
GEORGE Yap..
KRAMER All right we gotta get back to the show. What are you guys doing?
JERRY I'm going to the hospital, to visit Fulton.
KRAMER Oh, oh well say hello for me.
KRAMER Now look, we're going to stop at the shoe maker right now. You gotta get some lifts for your shoes.
MICKEY Lifts?! Look Kramer you don't understand, this kind of thing is just not done.
KRAMER You wanna keep your job don't you?
MICKEY Ya but..
KRAMER Yah! No Buts
MICKEY Kramer
KRAMER Yah!
JERRY Hey, woahoh Fulton. It's me.
FULTON Hey Jerry, good to see ya. I could really use a good laugh.
JERRY Who couldn't.
FULTON I haven't cracked a smile in months.
JERRY Oh don't worry, you'll crack. Cracking's inevitable, first you crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar Leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle. You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very cold... they were eating each other. Maybe this isn't a good time for a visit.
FULTON It's a fine time.
JERRY Oh, all right ah well... There's a priest, a minister and a rabbi, and they're all staring at him....
GEORGE So how were the eggs?
DAPHNE Eggs are eggs.
GEORGE Eggs are eggs. That is very profound. By the same token you could say fish is fish. Ha ha ha, I don't think so. Listen Daphne
DAPHNE Daphne.
GEORGE Daphne. I have to tell you something, this is very difficult...
DAPHNE Oh, I forgot to tell you. Al Netchie called me today.
GEORGE Ya, ya. I bumped into him on the bus. What did he have to say?
DAPHNE He told me not to get involved with you.
GEORGE What?
DAPHNE Ya, he said you could never make a commitment to any one and you'd just wind up hurting me.
GEORGE He said that? What a nerve. How dare he say something like that.
DAPHNE Is it true?
GEORGE Of course not. I mean sure, there may have been one or two occasions in the past, when I may have reacted in uh impulsive or somewhat immature manner, but those days are well behind me.
SON How long are you going to be away for Daddy?
FATHER I'm not really going away, I told you, I'll be back every other weekend.
SON Don't go Daddy, don't go.
FATHER Now Porter, you know your mother and I love you very much, but sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug.
DIRECTOR ...and there's your scene. Stand-ins
KRAMER Yo
STAGE_HAND All right you guys get on their spots so we can fix the lights.
KRAMER That's good work.
MICKEY How long you going to be away for Daddy?
KRAMER I'm not really going away, I told you I'd be back every other weekend.
MICKEY Don't go Daddy, don't...go.
KRAMER Now listen Porter, you know your mother and I love you very much. But sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug.
MICKEY Ah! all right all right! Kramer!
DIRECTOR Ok everybody that's lunch... one hour.
KRAMER How do those lifts feel?
MICKEY Quiet.
TAMMY Hi guys.
MICKEY Hey Tammy.
TAMMY Hey, you look different. Have you been working out?
MICKEY Not that I know of.

MICKEY Maybe. What's it to you?
JOHNNY Somethin' different about you.
MICKEY I got my hair cut that's all
JOHNNY Nah, that's not it. Something else... Ya you look different.
MICKEY You don't, you got the same ugly mug since the day I met ya.
JOHNNY I don't know what it is, but I'll find out. I'll find out.
JERRY ..so uh she's just sitting there and a uh Pachyderm, you remember the derm. He says uh, I'm gonna go up to her. So we uh he uh picks up the two pieces of pizza and uh the uh and then they're steaming hot and they're burning his hands see so he... he's juggling em he's jugglin em, jus throwing them up in the air and just as he gets up to her down they go. Well we all just lost it. It was really, really, funny.
PHIL Hey Jerry.
JERRY Hey Phil how you doing?
PHIL You look terrific.
JERRY I got my health.
PHIL Well, that's the most important thing. Hey how ya doing Fulton! Octane, Butane, Nitrane! How's he doing?
JERRY He could use a couple laughs.
ELAINE You should have told that story about Pachyderm dropping the pizza.
JERRY I told it. Ya?
GEORGE Ya
JERRY Ya. Hey you know what as I was leaving I bumped into Phil Titola. He is one of the greatest guys.
ELAINE Do I know him?
JERRY No, but I'll tell you something. Of all the guys I know, I could envision you going out with him.
ELAINE If you were a woman would you go out with him?
JERRY If I was a woman I'd be down at the dock waiting for the fleet to come in.
ELAINE Ya, I bet you would. all right, give him my number.
JERRY all right.
GEORGE This you are not going to believe. Al Netchie, that pimple. Tells Daphne, not get this 'Not to get involved with me.'
JERRY What?
GEORGE Ya. That's what she told me.
ELAINE Why?
GEORGE Because he's afraid she's gonna get hurt.
ELAINE Is she?
GEORGE Of course.
ELAINE So?
GEORGE Wa.. He doesn't have to tell her.
ELAINE Maybe he likes her.
GEORGE Oh no no no. He's deeply in love, and I was just about to break up with her when she told me.
JERRY So what are you gonna do?
GEORGE Well I can't break up with her now.
JERRY Why?
GEORGE Because he said I was going to.
ELAINE So now you're going to keep going out with her, for spite?
GEORGE Yes, I am.
JERRY Ya, I could see that.
GEORGE I don't see any way around it.
JERRY No, me either.
GEORGE What choice do I have?
JERRY None.
JERRY Fulton's wife told me it's all my fault. She said since my visit he's taken a turn for the worse.
KRAMER Did you tell him the Pachyderm story?
JERRY Yes I told him the Pachyderm story!
KRAMER Maybe I outta go over there.
JERRY Towards what end?
KRAMER I'm very good with sick people. They love me. When my friend Len Nicodemo had the gout, I moved into his hospital room for three days, the doctors were amazed at his recovery.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey Mick.
MICKEY Johnny Vigiano went through my locker.
KRAMER Yaoh!
MICKEY That little Bastard! He saw the lifts in my shoes. He knows I'm heightening. This never would have happened if you hadn't pushed me to get those things. I told you.
KRAMER Hey, nobody put a gun to your head.
MICKEY Ya well just keep out of my business you big ape.
KRAMER Who you calling big ape?
MICKEY You
JERRY All right break it up, break it up. Come on, just cut it out now
KRAMER Ya.
JERRY Behave yourselves.
MICKEY I'm sorry Kramer.
KRAMER No no it's all right, it's all right. You're stressed Oout!
JERRY Why does this guy Johnny have it in for you?
MICKEY Oh, he's always been jealous of me. I always get to stand in for the bigger stars; The Cosby Kids, Ricky Schroder, Macaulay Culkin.
KRAMER What's he like huh?
MICKEY He's a good kid.
KRAMER Ya?
JERRY So what does he care if you put lifts in?
MICKEY You don't understand. There's an unwritten code about this kind of thing. I could be ostracized. I remember when I was a kid, some guy tried to heighten. He lost his job, lost his friends, Everything. Oh, I knew I was crazy to try this kind of thing, but I was so desperate. What is this kid taking anyway? Hormones? Steroids? Would you tell me!?
DAPHNE George, tomorrow's Sunday. We could sleep late, and get the paper and half breakfast and spend the morning together, go for a long walk, maybe do a little shopping, have lunch...
GEORGE You know what. I don't think I'm going to be able to stay over tonight.
DAPHNE Why not?
GEORGE I, I really should go home. Ya.. actually I'm planning on spending the day with my father tomorrow we're uh we're going to a father-son picnic, just the two of us.
DAPHNE I thought we were going to spend the day together.
GEORGE Well Dad's been planning this for such a long time, he bought a new blanket, and he got tha...that game with foam paddles and the Velcro ball.
DAPHNE Have you given any more thought to what we talked about? You know, moving in?
GEORGE Yes, oh yes very much.
DAPHNE Maybe you don't want to move in.
GEORGE No, no I do. You know it's just...
DAPHNE Maybe Al Netchie was right, maybe I shouldn't have gotten involved with you.
GEORGE No he's not right. Al Netchie is not right! all right I'm canceling the father-son picnic. I don't know what he's gonna do with all that potato salad.
ELAINE So then Pachyderm picks up the pieces of pizza, and mind you know they are burning hot.. he can barely hold 'em. I mean he's like trying to juggle the pizza, you know ah. And then they go flying out of...
PHIL I'm peeing in my pants.
ELAINE they go flying out of his hands, and one lands on her face and the other lands on his face. and the whole place went crazy.
PHIL Oh, I'm sorry, Oh. What a story.
ELAINE I know, I know, I was unbelievable
PHIL Oh that is one of the funniest stories I've ever heard.
ELAINE I know.
PHIL Well this has been one hell of a night.
ELAINE Oh, I'm sorry Jerry didn't suggest this sooner.
PHIL You know, you really are beautiful Elaine.
ELAINE Oh, well, Good night.
PHIL Good night?
ELAINE Well
JERRY Come on Adrian give me another chance, I know I could cheer Fulton up. I'll tell you what, I'll do my act No new material He's never heard it. He'll love it, I just did it at the Concord last week. It killed. Thank you, thanks fo.. you will not regret this. Ok, Bye. Hey.

ELAINE Oh it be. You got any other friends you want to set me up with?
KRAMER Hey. Hey how was your date with Phil Titola?
ELAINE He took it out.
KRAMER Maybe uh, it needed some air. You know sometimes they need air, they can't breathe in there. It's in human.
GEORGE So she's just sitting there, she's having a pleasant conversation... and all of a sudden.
JERRY It.
GEORGE It.
JERRY Out.
GEORGE Out. Wow. I spend so much time trying to get their clothes off, I never thought of taking mine off. all right, Hey come on, get out of here, Daphne gonna be here any minute.
JERRY All right I'm going.
GEORGE You know what I've come to realize? I'm not just bored. I genuinely dislike her.
JERRY Well how long you are going to keep this up?
GEORGE Hey I'll get married if I have to. Al Netchie will think twice before he opens his mouth about me again.
JERRY You know George they are doing wonderful things at mental institutions these days. I'd be happy to set-up a meet and greet.
GEORGE I'm very disappointed to here you talk like that. You still don't know what makes me tick.
JERRY Yes I do.
GEORGE What are you doing?
JERRY I'm going to the hospital to see Fulton. I'm not even saying hello, I'm going right into material.
PHIL Ah hey Jer.
JERRY Oh hey Phil.
PHIL You know I'm sorry things didn't work out with Elaine. I don't know what I did wrong.
JERRY Well, y..you showed her who you are.
PHIL Oh, look at this, what she's got to breast feed in public.
JERRY Ya, that's the.. last thing you want to see. Well, next to last.
PHIL I'll see ya.
JERRY Ya take it easy.
JERRY Hey how ya doing? Good to be here.
KRAMER_AND_MICKEY Rock, paper, scissors match.

MICKEY Hey Tammy.
TAMMY Hello.
MICKEY So Tammy, finally, today's our big lunch.
TAMMY I don't think so.
MICKEY Why not? What the hell are you talking about?
TAMMY Look Mickey, everybody knows that you're heightening. It's all over the set.
MICKEY Wait, wait
TAMMY Don't touch me. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. All the progress we made over the years and you go and blow it by pulling a stupid stunt like this.
MICKEY Wait a second, wait a second, you got me all wrong. It was all because of the kid. The kid was growing. He shot up two and a half inches in a month. I woulda' lost my job. Any one of you would have done the same. You got no right! I'm Mickey Abbott! I stood in for Punky Brewster when all of you was nothing. It's all his fault. It was his idea.
TAMMY Come on Johnny, let's go get something to eat.
MICKEY Ah! Ah!
KRAMER What?
MICKEY Ah!
KRAMER Mickey!
JERRY This guy's belching out vitamins..
FULTON Stop.
JERRY and this whole justice league, Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman. You mean to tell me Superman can't cover everything?
FULTON Stop.
JERRY For crying out loud, He's Superman. Fulton? Fulton?
DAPHNE George, first let me just say I've never been with a guy who was so committed to commit. I mean it's so rare in men these days an, that's what makes this all the more difficult.
GEORGE Difficult?
DAPHNE The other day, after work, some girlfriends and I went to a bar for some drinks and there was this crazy mishap and I wound up meeting someone as a result. George...
GEORGE Oh, please don't.
DAPHNE Uh, I'm sorry. I'm afraid the worst of it is it's someone you know. Jerry Persheck.
GEORGE Pachyderm?
DAPHNE Heh, he was carrying these two pieces of pizza...
ELAINE She was hitting on you? My friend Noreen?
JERRY Your friend, Noreen.
ELAINE Are you sure you're not just flattering yourself?
JERRY If I was flattering myself, I think I'd come up with someone a little less annoying than Noreen.
ELAINE I cannot believe that she was hitting on you.
JERRY If you don't believe me, ask her.
ELAINE I will. Besides, she's got a boyfriend, Jerry, you know him. Dan. Remember, we went to that party at his house?
JERRY Oh, right. The guy who talks with a really high voice.
ELAINE Yeah.
KRAMER Jerry, did you get my Fortune magazine in your mail?
JERRY Check the pile.
KRAMER Oh, who sent you a card?
JERRY I don't know.
KRAMER Open it, it's from Hallmark.
JERRY Oh.
KRAMER Hello, my love.
ELAINE Hello, darling.
JERRY Isn't that cute, a 'thank you' card from Kristin.
KRAMER Let me see.
ELAINE Who's Kristin?
JERRY She works for PBS, I met her when I agreed to do that pledge drive.
KRAMER Did you ask her about me?
JERRY Yeah, in fact she said that you could be one of those people that sits in the back and answers the phone.
KRAMER Giddy-up! Alright! So now, how does that work? Now, what, I get a percentage of every pledge I bring in, right?
JERRY No, it's not aluminum siding, it's volunteer work. All the money goes to the station.
KRAMER Okay, yeah, alright, that sounds good, but I still get a tote bag though, right?
JERRY Yeah, and one of those foam beer can holders.
ELAINE You know what I'm doing? I'm calling Noreen.
JERRY Oh, go ahead.
ELAINE You sure you don't mind?
JERRY Like she's really going to admit she was flirting with me.
HIGH_PITCHED_VOICE Hello?
ELAINE Hi, it's Elaine. Listen, I was just talking to Jerry.
HIGH_PITCHED_VOICE Jerry?
ELAINE Jerry Seinfeld.
HIGH_PITCHED_VOICE Oh, I like Jerry a lot.
ELAINE You mean like like?
HIGH_PITCHED_VOICE What are you talking about?
ELAINE Noreen, were you hitting on him?
HIGH_PITCHED_VOICE Noreen's not here, this is Dan.
ELAINE Ooh.
DAN You say that Noreen was hitting on Jerry Seinfeld?
ELAINE Uh, I'll call you back later.
ELAINE Uh oh.
JERRY So was I right? She likes me, right?
MR._PITT Hello? It's for you. Must you keep giving my number out?
ELAINE Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Pitt. Hello?
HIGH_PITCHED_VOICE Elaine? What is going on? Why did you tell Dan I was hitting on Jerry Seinfeld?
ELAINE Is this Noreen?
HIGH_PITCHED_VOICE What would ever possess you to make up a story like that.
ELAINE Well, listen, Jerry mentioned it, and, I don't know--
DAN I think I deserve an explanation.
ELAINE Noreen, are you crying?
DAN No, this is Dan!
ELAINE Oh, hi Dan.
MR._PITT Elaine? Work?
ELAINE Tell Noreen I'll just call her back later.
MR._PITT Who was crying?
ELAINE No one. I'm sorry Mr. Putt, that won't happen again.
MR._PITT I'm sure it won't, but someone was crying and I want to know who it was.
ELAINE Well, it's a long story, okay? But my stupid friend Jerry told my other friend Noreen that she was-- You know, hitting on him and so I called her to see what was, uh, going on and I accidentally got her boyfriend, who is this, you know--
JERRY I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis at PBS. Show us you care. Call in your pledge now.
KRISTIN Jerry, I am so grateful that you're doing this.
JERRY Oh, I know you are.
KRISTIN You got the card I sent?
JERRY I did.
KRISTIN So where is it?
JERRY What?
KRISTIN The card. Is this it in the trash?
JERRY No?
KRISTIN This is my card, you threw it away.
JERRY Well--
KRISTIN I put a lot of thought into this card.
JERRY You signed your name and you addressed the envelope, it's not like you painted the picture and wrote the poem.
KRISTIN Fine. I gotta get back to the office.
JERRY Why, because I threw the card out? How long was I supposed to save it?
KRISTIN You have no sentimentality.
JERRY I have sentimentality, really, I'm sentimental. Here, look. Here's some cards I've saved, these are birthday cards from my grandmother, see, I'm not a bad guy.
KRISTIN Oh, so you save her cards but not mine! Oh great!
JERRY Well, but, you see, I saved something! See? I can save. I'll see you at the pledge drive, ok?
KRAMER New cards, huh?
JERRY No, they're old cards from my grandmother.
KRAMER Oh. Well, I'll tell you, a nice greeting card can really lift a person's spirits.
JERRY Yeah.
KRAMER Oh, a check.
JERRY Yeah, she puts ten dollars in every card for my birthday, that's why I save them.
KRAMER There's a check in all these? Why don't you cash them?
JERRY I don't know, it's ten dollars.
KRAMER But you got a whole pile here. 1987?
JERRY Oh so what.
KRAMER Jerry, your grandmother gave you this gift. She wants you to spend the money, to have the fun that she can't have. Oh, this is tantamount to a slap in the face.
JERRY Oh, get out of here.
KRAMER Jerry, a gift not enjoyed is like a flower that doesn't blossom.
JERRY Alright, alright, I'll cash the checks.
KRAMER Yeah.
JERRY It was a 'thank you' card from Kristin because I'm doing the PBS drive. I mean, how long am I supposed to keep it?
GEORGE The rule is a minimum of two days.
JERRY You making that up or do you know what you're talking about?
GEORGE I'm making it up.
JERRY I mean really, what's the point of saving it? I could see if I had a mantel.
GEORGE Oh, well, a mantel's a whole different story.
JERRY Absolutely.
GEORGE If my parents had a mantel, I might be a completely different person.
JERRY So anyway, she's kind of upset about it so I need you to do me a favor.
GEORGE Let's have it.
JERRY Well, I'm doing the PBS show, so during the show they're gonna be running the Ken Burns baseball thing. So I thought if I could get a baseball player to come on the show with me...
GEORGE You want me to ask one of the Yankees.
JERRY Could you?
GEORGE Alright. I'll run it by a few people.
JERRY Alright, Do your thing, where you lie to everyone.
ELAINE I should never have made that phone call.
JERRY Hey, did you ever get to talk to Noreen?
ELAINE Yes, she's very upset.
JERRY So was I right about the flirting? Was it true?
ELAINE I don't know, I never asked. She was yelling--
GEORGE Who was flirting with you?
JERRY Remember when we were in the bookstore, that woman came up to us?
GEORGE She wasn't flirting with you.
JERRY Oh, sure she was; Asked me where the 'humor' section was? Humor? Come on.
ELAINE Jerry, her brother just had a book of political cartoons published.
JERRY Alright, so maybe she wasn't flirting with me. So what?
ELAINE So, yeah, that's funny. Hey, you wanna hear something weird? Mr. Pitt eats his Snickers bars with a knife and fork.
GEORGE Really?
ELAINE Yeah.
JERRY Why does he do that?
GEORGE He probably doesn't want to get chocolate on his fingers. That's the way these society types eat their candy bars.
JERRY Oh, you know.
GEORGE What, you think I eat all my meals with you? Excuse me, sweetheart? I think you may have overcharged us. What is this?
WAITRESS That's the extra toast. Get it?
GEORGE Got it. Did you just see what happened here?
ELAINE What?
GEORGE Did you see the way she pointed at the check? She gave me the finger.
JERRY That's how waitress types express derision. They don't want to get their mouths dirty.
GEORGE So, what do you think?
MR._MORGAN A PBS fundraiser? I'm not gonna waste any of the players' time with that, besides the team already does so much promotion for channel eleven.
GEORGE Channel eleven? Forgive me for trying to class up this place, for trying to have the Yankees reach another strata of society that might not watch channel eleven.
MR._MORGAN Uh, what the hell are you doing?
GEORGE I am eating my dessert. How do you eat it, with your hands?
MR._MORGAN You know, maybe George has something here about PBS.
JERRY Okay, sixty bucks from Nana.
KRAMER Huh? Yeah.
NANA Hello?
VOICE Hello, this is Chemical Bank. Just wanted you to know that your checking account is overdrawn.
NANA Chemical Bank? I haven't used that account in months.
VOICE Well, someone's been cashing the checks and you're overdrawn. Oh dear. I'll be down there first thing in the morning.
VOICE Wait, we can do this over the phone.
JERRY You got Danny Tartabull?!
GEORGE You wanted a Yankee, I got you a Yankee.
JERRY Boy, you really came through. Kristin's gonna be thrilled.
GEORGE Hey, the Bull owes me one, I helped him with his swing.
KRAMER So you're bringing Danny Tartabull to the fundraiser tonight.
GEORGE Absolutely. Pending approval of the script.
JERRY Excuse me?
GEORGE Jerry, I'm Yankee management.
KRAMER Yeah, I'd like to see the script too.
JERRY You're just answering phones!
KRAMER It would put me at ease.
GEORGE Hey, when you order from the waitress, get her to point to the menu. I want to see what finger she uses.
JERRY Uh, say, I wanted a side order of fruit but I didn't see it on the men
WAITRESS Oh, you're getting it , it comes with your breakfast special.
JERRY Right you are.
GEORGE I didn't get the special, but I'd also like the fresh fruit too.
WAITRESS I'll check.
GEORGE I don't believe it, she did it again!
JERRY Oh, she had an itch.
GEORGE She had an itch. She could have used any one of those fingers. That finger was meant for me.
KRAMER Yeah, she knew what she was doing.
JERRY By the way, lunch is on me. I just cashed my Nana's birthday checks.
STREET_TOUGH Looking for something, lady?
NANA Isn't the Chemical Bank on this block?
STREET_TOUGH The bank? It burned. It's gone!
NANA Oh dear.
STREET_TOUGH Now what you wanna do is go down to forty-ninth street, that's the main customer service branch. Ask for Mr. Fleming. He'll help you.
JERRY Hello?
UNCLE_LEO Jerry? Hello.
JERRY Uncle Leo! Listen, I don't want to alarm you, but your nana is missing.
JERRY Nana's missing?
UNCLE_LEO I came to pick her up for a doctor's appointment, she wasn't here. I called the doctor, nobody knows where she is. She hasn't left the apartment in twenty-five years!
JERRY I've been thinking about her, I just cashed some of her checks.
KRAMER Yeah, that's right. You did.
UNCLE_LEO What kind of checks?
JERRY I think Chemical Bank.
KRAMER Oh, they were Chemical.
UNCLE_LEO Chemical?! She hasn't used that account since her branch closed. What are you doing cashing her checks anyway?
JERRY Well, Kramer thought it would make her happy. I never should have cashed those checks!
KRAMER Hey, I didn't twist your arm.
UNCLE_LEO Your grandmother's on a very fixed income. What, are you broke?
JERRY Just call me if you hear anything. Well? I cashed the checks, the checks bounced and now my Nana's missing!
KRAMER Well, don't look at me.
JERRY It's your fault!
KRAMER My fault? Your Nana is missing because she's been passing those bum checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people.
NOREEN So anyway, it's caused a lot of problems. Dan thinks I'm interested in Jerry, he won't let up.
ELAINE I'm really sorry, but you can see why I'd make a mistake like that.
NOREEN No, why?
ELAINE Well, you know, because he's a high talker.
NOREEN He does raise his voice occasionally, but that's normal.
ELAINE No. No, no, no, not a loud talker, a high talker.
NOREEN Really?
ELAINE You don't think his voice sounds a lot like yours?
NOREEN I never noticed that.
ELAINE Well, it's no big deal, you know, it's just that he can sound like a woman, you know?
NOREEN Great. I'm going out with a man who sounds like a woman.
ELAINE Well, he looks like a man.
NOREEN Yeah.
ELAINE He's bald. I know that's a guy thing.
NOREEN I guess.
ELAINE I know he belches a lot.
NOREEN Well, that's something. So, Jerry thought I was flirting with him.
ELAINE Yeah.
NOREEN Hm. He's kind of a baritone, isn't he?
ELAINE What are you doing?
NOREEN I'm eating this cookie.
ELAINE No, no, no, but why are you using a knife and a fork? Did you just think of that?
NOREEN No, I've seen people do it. I like it.
DANNY_TARTABULL This isn't gonna take long, is it?
GEORGE Oh no, in and out, I made sure of that. And you'll be happy to know I perused the script and it's met with my approval.
DANNY_TARTABULL I'm sure it's fine.
GEORGE Hey! Watch it! Did you see that guy? He just gave me the finger!
DANNY_TARTABULL You sure?
GEORGE Oh yeah! Middle finger, straight up, at me! At us!
DANNY_TARTABULL What are you doing?
GEORGE I'm following him. Nana is at the bank.
BANKER I'm sorry, the account had insufficient funds. We had to return the checks made out to a Mr. Jerry Seinfeld.
NANA Oh dear, that's my grandson. May I call him now and explain?
BANKER Oh, certainly.
ELAINE And now I think she might really be interested in you. And Dan is obsessed, he keeps leaving these annoying messages on my machine.
JERRY Would you?
ELAINE Hello?
NANA Hello, I need to speak to Jerry.
ELAINE Oh, it's you. We were just talking about you. Listen, Jerry doesn't want to talk to you. Nobody wants to talk to you, so why don't you just drop dead?
ELAINE Heh?
KRAMER Any word from Nana?
JERRY No.
ELAINE Nana?
JERRY Yeah, my grandma's missing.
ELAINE Missing?
JERRY Yeah. I think it might have something to do with those checks.
ELAINE Um, what does Nana sound like?
JERRY Like a grandmother, why?
ELAINE Well...
JERRY Oh, you hung up on my Nana?!
ELAINE I don't know, maybe.
JERRY You told Nana to drop dead?!
ELAINE It's possible.
JERRY Yes, it is!
KRAMER Alright, alright. Look, Jerry, we gotta get down to PBS, PDQ.
JERRY Alright.
GEORGE No one gives us the finger! We're Yankees!
DANNY_TARTABULL Want this last donut?
GEORGE No, you can have it.
KRAMER Jerry, where are all the tote bags?
JERRY I don't know.
KRAMER Well, I'm not leaving the premises without tote bags. I was promised tote bags and tote bags I shall have.
KRISTIN Jerry, this man wants to see you.
JERRY Leo?
UNCLE_LEO Hello.
JERRY Uncle Leo! What are you doing here?
UNCLE_LEO I wanted to tell you that your grandmother is fine.
JERRY Oh.
UNCLE_LEO She's had quite a day but she's gonna watch you tonight on the TV.
KRISTIN Jerry, I'm dying to meet Danny Tartabull. Where is he?
JERRY He'll be here any second.
KRISTIN You know you guys are both on in five minutes.
JERRY Yeah, yeah.
KRISTIN Okay.
UNCLE_LEO Why didn't you tell me you were a little short? Here. If anybody asks you where you got it, you don't know.
JERRY No, that's ok, I really don't need any money.
UNCLE_LEO What are you talking about?
JERRY Please-
UNCLE_LEO I want-
JERRY It's not necessary.
UNCLE_LEO Jerry, would you please take it.
JERRY I can't, I can't take it.
UNCLE_LEO I want you to have it!
JERRY Uncle Leo, I don't want to have it!
UNCLE_LEO Jerry, take the money!
JERRY I don't want it!!
HIGH_PITCHED_VOICE Jerry, open up. We need to talk.
KRAMER Who's that?
JERRY You know what? It sounds like the friend of Elaine's that was hitting on me in the book store.
KRAMER Jerry, I'll take care of it.
DAN Is Jerry in there?
KRAMER Well, he can't be disturbed now.
DAN Well this situation is driving me crazy. He's all I think about. I can't get him out of my mind.
KRAMER I'm sorry. I mean, I know what it's like to be in love. Ties you up in knots. And Jerry is a very sexy man.
DAN What?
KRAMER Look, I'm not judging you. In fact, we here at PBS, we have many programs celebrating your lifestyle. Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City, Gender Bending and Swinging in San Francisco. Before Stonewall about those dark ages when you couldn't come out of the closet, lest you be persecuted because of your, you know.
DAN No, I don't.
KRISTIN Are you Danny Tartabull?
DAN No, I'm not.
GEORGE I'll take care of this, Danny.
GEORGE Excuse me.
MAN What's the problem?
GEORGE I believe you cut me off, and then made an obscene gesture.
MAN I did? Where?
GEORGE Outside of Manhattan, about an hour ago.
MAN Wow! Is that Danny Tartabull?
GEORGE That's right, of the New York Yankees.
MAN I'd like to shake his hand but I can't.
JERRY I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis here at PBS. Our lines are open, so please call the number you see on your screen.
JERRY This is the only time this year we'll be asking for donations. You've been enjoying Ken Burns' Baseball-
KRAMER PBS pledge drive.
NANA Hello, I'd like to speak with Jerry.
KRAMER Oh, you again. Buddy, look, forget about Jerry. It's not gonna happen.
NANA This is his grandmother.
KRAMER Oh, uh, Nana. Hello.
NANA Tell Jerry I'm sorry, I'm going to have to write him some new checks.
KRAMER As long as you've got your checkbook out, how about forking a little over to PBS? You watch the station, don't you? You don't want to be a freeloader.
JERRY -programs like Ken Burns' Baseball. And if Danny Tartabull were here, I'm sure he'd say, 'That's correct, Jerry.'
KRAMER Jerry? I have an announcement. Your grandmother is on the line.
JERRY My Nana?
KRAMER And as we speak, she's generously writing PBS a check for fifteen hundred dollars!
UNCLE_LEO She can't do that, she's on a very fixed income! Stop the show!!
JERRY I got another card from Kristin. Not quite as chipper as the first one.
ELAINE Wow. Isn't this little bunny giving you the-
JERRY Yes, he is.
ELAINE You should show this to Georgie. Yeah.
WAITRESS Here's your knife and fork.
JERRY Look, she's cutting up an Almond Joy.
ELAINE I just don't get it.
JERRY You know, I saw someone on the street eating M&Ms with a spoon.
ELAINE What is wrong with everybody?
JERRY Look, they're doing it. They're all doing it!
ELAINE What is wrong with all you people?! Have you all gone mad?!!
JERRY Most men like working on things, tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed a guy's out in his driveway working on something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies. Men, it's true, men hear a drill, it's like a dog whistle. Just.. you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, "Honey, I think Jim's working on something over there." So they run over to the guy. Now they don't actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. That's what men want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, "What are you using, the Philips head?" You know, we feel involved. That's why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, that's just to keep the men out. They cut those little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. But if they don't cut those holes - we are climbing those fences. Right over there. "What are you using the steel girders down there? Yeah, that'll hold."
GEORGE I had to say something. I had to say something. Everything was going so well; I had to say something.
JERRY I don't think you did anything wrong.
GEORGE I told her I liked her. Why? Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. I like you I don't tell you.
JERRY We can only thank God for that.
GEORGE I'm outta the picture. I am outta the picture. It's only a matter of time now.
JERRY You're imagining this. Really.
GEORGE Oh no. No, no, no, no.
GEORGE I'll tell you when it happened. When that floss came flying out of my pocket.
JERRY What floss? When?
GEORGE We were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange drink, for five dollars. I reached into my pocket to pay for it, I looked down; there's this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers.
JERRY Ah, mint.
GEORGE Of course. So, I'm looking at it, I look up, I see she's looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. I just..
JERRY So let me get this straight: she saw the floss, you panicked and you told her you liked her.
GEORGE If I didn't put that floss in my pocket, I'd be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses.
JERRY And you're sure the floss was the catalyst?
GEORGE Yes, I am.
JERRY You don't think it might've had anything to do with that?
GEORGE What? You don't like this?
JERRY It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal.
KRAMER Oh, they've got a cure for cancer. See, it's all big business.. Oh hey, Jerry just walked in. Hi, George. Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, take my number - 555-8643. Okay, here he is.
JERRY Who is it?
KRAMER Take it.
JERRY Who is it?
KRAMER It's for you.
JERRY Hello? Oh, hi Joel. .. No. I was out of town. I just got back.. Kramer doesn't know anything.. He's just my next-door neighbor. Uh.. nothing much.. Tuesday? Uh, Tuesday, no. I'm meeting somebody.. Uh, Wednesday? Wednesday's okay.. Alright. Uh, I'm a little busy right now. Can we talk Wednesday morning? .. Okay.. yeah.. right.. thanks.. bye. Why did you put me on the phone with him? I hate just being handed a phone.
KRAMER Well, it's your phone. He wanted to talk to you
JERRY Maybe I didn't want to talk to him.
KRAMER Well, why not?
JERRY He bothers me. I don't even answer the phone anymore because of him. He's turned me into a screener. Now I gotta go see him on Wednesday.
GEORGE What do you mean Wednesday? I though we had tickets to the Knick game Wednesday. We got seats behind the bench! What happened? We're not going?
JERRY We're going. That's next Wednesday.
GEORGE Oh. Who is this guy?
JERRY His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were friends. Should I suffer the rest of my life because I like to play Ping Pong? I was ten. I would've been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table.. he's so self-involved.
KRAMER That's for me. Kramerica Industries.. Oh, hi, Mark.. No, no, no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza place where you make your own pie.
JERRY Can you conduct your business elsewhere?
KRAMER No, no, no. I'm talking about a whole chain of 'em. Yeah.
GEORGE I don't know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, I'll tell you that.
JERRY I don't bother with him. He's been calling me for seven years. I've never called him once! He's got the attention span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit there and I make up things just to see if he's paying attention.
GEORGE I don't understand why you spend time with this guy.
JERRY What can I do? Break up with him? Tell him "I Don't think we're right for each other.." He's a guy. At least with a woman, there's a precendent. You know, the relationship goes sour, you end it.
GEORGE No, no, no,no you have to approach this as if he was a woman.
JERRY Just break up with him?
GEORGE Absolutely. You just tell him the truth.
JERRY As a guy I don't know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? I don't know how to say, "Bill, I feel I need to see other men." Do you know what I mean? There's nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think that's the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See, the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just because they're two guys. That's almost all we need to have in common. 'Cause sports - sports and women - is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever say is "So, what's in the refrigerator?"
JOEL ..so my shrink wants me to bring my mother in for a session. This guy is a brilliant man. Lenny Bruce used to go to him.. and I think, uh, Geraldo.
JERRY You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography, I thought it was really - interesting.. he would-
JOEL Hey, hey, hey, hey we're starving here! We've been waiting here for ten minutes already!
JERRY So, I'm thinking about going to Iran this summer.
JOEL I have to eat! I mean, I'm hypoglycemic.
JERRY Anyway, the Hizballah has invited me to perform. You know, it's their annual terrorist luncheon. I'm gonna do it is Farsi.
JOEL Do you think I need a haircut?
WAITRESS Are you ready?
JERRY Yeah, I'll have the egg salad on whole wheat.
JOEL Let me ask you a question. This, uh, this turkey sandwich here, is that real turkey, or is it a turkey roll? I don't want that processed turkey. I hate it.
WAITRESS I think it's real turkey.
JOEL Is there a real bird in the back?
WAITRESS No, there's not bird but-
JOEL Well, how do you know for sure? Look, why don't you do me a favor. Why don't you go in the back and find out, okay?
JOEL Unbelievable..
JERRY How can you talk to someone like that?
JOEL What are you saying? What, you like turkey roll?
JERRY Listen, Joel. There's something I have to tell you.
JOEL Wait, you'll never guess who I ran into.
JERRY_AND_JOEL Howard metro.
JOEL He asked me if I still saw you. I said, "Sure, I see him all the time. We're great friends." Anyway, Howard says hello.
JERRY ..listen, Joel.. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
JOEL what?
JERRY This friendship.. it's not working.
JOEL Not working? What are you talking about?
JERRY We're just not suited to be friends.
JOEL How can you say that?
JERRY Look, you're a nice guy, it's just that - we don't have anything in common.
JOEL Wait. Wat did I do? Tell me.. I want to know.
JERRY You didn't do anything. It's not you, it's me. It's.. this is very difficult.
JOEL Look, I know I call you too much, right? I mean, I know you're a very busy guy.
JERRY No, it's not that.
JOEL You're one of the few people I can talk to.
JERRY Oh, come on. That's not true.
JOEL I always tell everybody about you; tell everybody to go see your show. I mean, I'm your biggest fan!
JERRY I know, I know.
JOEL I mean, you're my best friend.
JERRY Best friend? I've never been to your apartment.
JOEL I cannot believe that this is happening. I can't believe it.
JERRY Okay, okay. Forget it. It's okay. Id didn't mean it.
JOEL Didn't mean what?
JERRY What I said. I've been under a lot of stress.
JOEL Oh, you've been under a lot of stress.
JERRY Just, can we just forget the whole thing ever happend? I'm sorry. I din't mean it. I took it out on you. We're still friends. We're still friends. Still friends. Okay? Look, I'll tell you what. I've got Knick tickets this Wednesday. Great seats behind the bench. You want to come with me? Come on.
JOEL Tonight?
JERRY No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight, I would've said tonight.
JOEL Do you really want me to go?
JERRY Yes.
JOEL Okay. yeah, okay. Great! That would be, that'd be great.. so, next Wednesday.
JERRY Next Wednesday.
JOEL Where is that waitress?! Hey! ..
GEORGE ..she calls me up at my office, she says, "We have to talk."
JERRY Uh, the four worst words in the English language.
GEORGE That, or "Who's bra is this?"
JERRY That is worse.
GEORGE So we order lunch, and we're talking. Finally, she blurts out how it's "not working".
JERRY Really.
GEORGE So, I'm thinking, as she's saying this, I'm thinking: great, the relationship's over. But the egg salad's on the way. So now I have a decision - do I walk or do I eat?
JERRY Hm? You ate.
GEORGE We sat there for twenty minutes, chewing, staring at each other in a defunct relationship.
JERRY Someone says, "Get out of my life!" and that doesn't affect your appetite?
GEORGE Have you ever had their egg salad?
JERRY It is unbelievable.
GEORGE It's unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? I picked up the check. She didn't even offer. She ended it. The least she could do is send me off with a sandwich.
JERRY How much could you possibly have in there?
GEORGE It's my money. What should I do? Throw it out the window? I know guy who took his vacation on change.
JERRY Yeah? Where'd he go? To and arcade?
GEORGE That's funny. You're a funny guy.
JERRY C'mon, move up.
CUSTOMER Oh great, Ewing's hurt.
GEORGE Ewing's hurt? How long is he going to be out?
CUSTOMER A couple of days at the most but..
GEORGE Geez.
JERRY Oh, God.
GEORGE I got scared there for a second. The Knicks without Ewing.
JERRY Listen, George, little problem with the game.
GEORGE What about it?
JERRY The thing is, yesterday, I kind of.. uh..
GEORGE What?
JERRY I geve your ticket to Horneck.
GEORGE You what?!
JERRY Yeah, I'm sorry. I had to give it to Horneck.
GEORGE No! My ticket?! You gave my ticket to Horneck?
JERRY C'mon, c'mon, go ahead, move up.
GEORGE Why did you give him my ticket for?
JERRY You didn't see him. It was horrible.
GEORGE Oh, c'mon, Jerry. I can't believe this.
JERRY I had to do it.
GEORGE Oh, please. Can you change this into bills?
TELLER I'm sorry, sir. We can't do that.
JERRY Do you want to go with him? You go. I don't mind.
GEORGE I'm not going with him. I don't even know the guy. Look, they did this for me before.
TELLER Look, I can give you these and you can roll them yourself.
GEORGE You want me to roll six thousand of these?! What, should I quit my job?!
JERRY I do not like the bank. I've heard the expression "Laughing all the way to the bank." I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate it when there's nobody on the line at all, you know that part, you go to the bank, it's empty and you still have to go through the little maze. "Can you get a little piece of cheese for me? I'm almost at the front. I'd like a reward for this please."
GEORGE ..Thirty-two, thirty-three-
JERRY George.
GEORGE Not now.. .
JERRY Could you stop the counting?
GEORGE Nnnnnnnninngaaa! What?!
JERRY Can I make it up to you? I'll give you fifty bucks for the jug.
GEORGE Oh, yeah, sure. Keep your money.
JERRY Well, then I'm not going to the game either. Okay? I'll give him both tickets.
GEORGE Oh geeeee.. Go, go!
JERRY I.. no, I don't want to go.
GEORGE He was really crying?
JERRY I had to give him a tissue. In fact, let me call his machine now and I'll just make up some excuse why I can't go to the game either.
GEORGE Wait a minute. Wait a minute. As long as you're going to lie to the guy, why don't you tell him that you lost both of the tickets, then we could go?
JERRY George, the man wept.
KRAMER Oh, hey guys. Man, I'm telling you. This pizza idea, is really going to happen.
GEORGE This is the thing where you go and you have to make your own pizza?
KRAMER Yeah, we give you the dough, you smash it, you pound it, you fling it in the air; and then you get to put your sauce and you get to sprinkle your cheese, and they - you slide it into the oven.
GEORGE You know, you have to know how to do that. You can't have people shoving their arms into a six-hundred degree oven.
KRAMER It's all supervised.
GEORGE Oh, well.
KRAMER All of it. You want to invest?
GEORGE My money's all tied up in change right now.
KRAMER No, I'm tellin' ya, people, they really want to make their own pizza pie.
JERRY I have to say something. With all due respect, I just never.. I can't imagine anyone in any walk of life, under any circumstance, wanting to make their own pizza pie.. but that's me.
KRAMER That's you.
JERRY I'm just saying..
KRAMER Okay, okay. I just wanted to check with you guys.
JERRY Okay.
KRAMER You know, this business is going to be big. I just wanted .. okay. One day, you'll beg me to make your own pie.
JERRY Hi, Joel. This is Jerry. I hope you get this before you - Oh, Hi. Joel.. oh, you just came in.. listen, I can't amke it to the game tonight. I, uh, have to tutor my nephew - Yeah, he's got an exam tomarrow.. geometry.. you know, trapezoids, rhombus.. Anyway, listen, you take the tickets. They're at the Will-Call window.. And I'm really sorry.. Have a good time. We'll talk next week. Okay.. yeah, I don't.. fine.. fine.. bye. .
GEORGE Trapezoid?
JERRY I know. I'm really running out of excuses with this guy. I need some kind of excuse Rolodex.
ELAINE Come on, let's go do something. I don't want to just sit around here.
JERRY Okay.
ELAINE Want to go get something to eat?
JERRY Where do you want to go?
ELAINE I don't care, I'm not hungry.
JERRY We could go to one of those cappuccino places. They let you just sit there.
ELAINE What are we gonna do there? Talk?
JERRY We can talk.
ELAINE I'll go if I don't have to talk.
JERRY We'll just sit there.
ELAINE Okay. I'm gonna check my machine first.
ELAINE "Picking someone up at the airport." "Jury Duty." "Waiting for cable guy."
JERRY Okay, just ahnd that over, please.
ELAINE Oh, what is this?
JERRY It's a list of excuses, it's for that guy, Horneck, who's at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that list now so in case he calls, I just consult it and i don't have to see him. I need it. What are you doing?
ELAINE I got some for you.
JERRY I don't need anymore.
ELAINE No, no, no, no, no, these are good. Listen, listen: "You ran out of underwear, you can't leave the house."
JERRY Very funny.
ELAINE How about: "You've been diagnosed as a multiple personality, you're not even you, you're Dan."
JERRY I'm Dan. Can I have my list back, please?
ELAINE Here, here. Jerry Seinfeld, I cannot believe you're doing this. This is absolutely infantile.
JERRY What can I do?
ELAINE Deal with it. Be a man!
JERRY Oh no. That's impossible. I'd rather lie to him for the rest of my life that go through that again. He was crying, tears accompanied by mucus.
ELAINE You made a man cry? I've never made a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didn't cry.. I got the cab.
JERRY A couple of touch monkeys.
KRAMER Oh, hi Elaine, hey. Hey, you missed a great game tonight, buddy!
JERRY Game?
KRAMER Knock game. Horneck took me. We were sitting two rows behind the bench. We were getting hit by sweat!
JERRY Wait. How does Horneck know you?
KRAMER Last week. When I, you know, game you the phone. He's really into my pizza place idea!
JERRY This is too much.
ELAINE Wait, what pizza place idea?
JERRY Oh, no.
KRAMER You make your own pie!
ELAINE Oh, that sounds like a great idea. It would be fun.
JOEL Kramer..
KRAMER Yeah.
JERRY Perfect.
JOEL Hey..
KRAMER Okay, who wants meatloaf?
JERRY_AND_ELAINE No thanks.
KRAMER It's gonna be hot in a minute.
JOEL So, I though you were tutoring your nephew?
JERRY Oh, we finished early.
JOEL Uhm, I'll bet. So, are you going to introduce me to your - nephew?
JERRY Elaine Benes, this is Joel Horneck.
ELAINE Hi.
JOEL Whoa, Nelson! This is Elaine? I though you guys split?
JERRY We're still friends.
JOEL So, thanks again for those tickets. But next week, I'm going to take you. You about next Tuesday night? And why don't you come along?
ELAINE Oh, no, no. Tuesday's no good becasue we've got choir practice.
JERRY Right. I forgot about choir.
ELAINE We're doing that evening of Eastern European National Anthems.
JERRY Right. You know, the wall being down and everything.
JOEL What about Thursday night? I mean they're playing the Sonics.
ELAINE Huh... Thursday is not good because we've got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors.
JOEL You know, I should really try something like that.
JERRY You really should.
JOEL Well, let's just take a look here. Forty-one home games. Saturday night we've got the mavericks. If you don't like the Mavericks, next Tuesday - Lakers. I mean, you gotta like Magic, right? Let's see, on the road, on the road, on the road, on the road, back on the fourteenth. They play the Bulls. You can't miss Air Jordan..
JERRY You know, I really.. I've come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in you life that they're just always your friends and you have to accept it. You see them, you don't really want to see them. You don't call them. They call you. You don't call back. They call again. The only way to get through talking with people that you don't really have anything in common with is to pretend you're hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend there's a little desk around you. The only problem with this is there's no way you can say, "Hey, it's been great having you on the show. Were out of time."
JERRY Well this is it.
NAOMI This is nice. Thanks again for the Chinese food.
JERRY Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that garlic.
NAOMI Yeah, me too,
JERRY No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things were garlic.
NAOMI Laughs - ha ha ha . Oh, you know what? I think Naked gun is on. I've seen it. I laughed through that whole thing. You wanna watch?
JERRY No, I mean, I don't think so.
NAOMI I thought you liked to laugh. I thought you uwere happy go lucky.
JERRY No, nah, I'm not happy and I'm not lucky, and I don't go. If anything I'm sad stop unlucky.
NAOMI ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
JERRY That's not funny Naiomi. I didn't mean to be funny there. Why don't you check the TV guide. I think uh, Holacost is on.
GEORGE Jerry, it's George. Hey, hey are you all set foe the week end. This is going to be great. You're going to have a great time with Naomi. All right, you know she's got that laugh. What did you say? It's like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer? Anyway, i was thinking we would take two cars up to the cabin and that way if one of wanted to stay you know...
JERRY This thing has never worked right.
NAOMI You think I laugh like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?
JERRY Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved internationally known cartoon characters of all time. "I'm going to kill that cwazy wabbit ... ha ha " Come on. Not only that, a juicer is one of the healthiest ways ... it makes the juice ... extracts the pulp and the vitamins, for long life and vitality.
JERRY How could you leave a mesage like that on my machine.?
GEORGE Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?
JERRY Because I didn't think anyone would leave it!
GEORGE Well, I didn't think anyone would play it.
JERRY Well, now she's not going away for this weekend.
GEORGE What do you mean not goin'? We got plans here. Call her up.
JERRY Well, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a girl with a laugh like that? It's like Coco Chanel goin' out with a fish monger. Cause she's with all the perfumes and a fish mongers a pretty bad smell.
GEORGE Well maybe you should ask Elaine.
JERRY Yeah but if I ask Elaine, Kramer will feel slighted.
GEORGE Oh no no, don't say anything to Kramer. Susan can't stand him. He vomited all over her.
JERRY Yeah, .. wait a minute do you smell smoke?
JERRY Ah, Kramer.
KRAMER Hello boys, top of the morning to ya. What do you say? What do ya be?

But I met the pro at the golf shop up on 49th St. and I gave him one of these Cubans and he invites me up to play a free round then he says anytime I lay one of these babies on him it's going to be the same deal. Ha ha. Isn't that beautiful.

MEL Excuse me, i
ELAINE Here

ELAINE It's no big deal Jerry. We'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
JERRY I don't even know where the bubble boy lives. I don't even remember the name of the town.
ELAINE Wa',you don't have the directions?
JERRY No, I was following him.
ELAINE How could you not take the directions?

JERRY A smirk?
GEORGE Maybe!.. And I'm moving back in there!
JERRY I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.

KRAMER Alright. I'm ready. You know, I still don't understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents?
GEORGE I don't want to! I'm outta money! I got 714 dollars left in the bank.

ESTELLE So, how are ya, Jerry?
JERRY Fine, Mrs. Costanza. Hey, I got a terrific joke for you..
ESTELLE Nah, not interested.
JERRY No, no. It's really funny. There's these two guys-
ESTELLE Tell it to the audience. Here, I made some bologna sandwiches.
GEORGE Bologna?! No one eats bologna anymore!
ESTELLE What are you talking about?! Have a sandwich.
JERRY No thanks.
ESTELLE Oh, stop it! You don't want one, Kramer?
KRAMER Uhh.. no thanks.
ESTELLE I think you're all a little touched in the head. You're so worried about your health.. You're young men.
JERRY I really don't eat it.
ESTELLE What am I gonna do with all these sandwiches?! Will you take them home? Give them to someone in your building?
JERRY I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building..
KRAMER Alright, that's it. Anything else?

KRAMER Oh, I gotta go move the car.
JERRY Well, I guess we'll be going..

JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE Wha - what are you doing later?
JERRY Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend.
GEORGE Really?
JERRY Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers. You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going 'excuse me?', 'what was that?'
GEORGE Yeah.. may - maybe I'll meet ya?
ESTELLE No, George. We're going out to eat tonight with your father.
GEORGE Oh.. okay.. talk to you later.
JERRY Yeah, take it easy.
GEORGE Oh, my God..
ELAINE Okay, well, he had this idea of a pizza place where you make your own pie!
JERRY Right.
ELIANE You remember that?
KRAMER Yeah, well, that was a good one.
JERRY Well..
ELAINE What's that?
JERRY Excuse me?
JERRY Yeah.. yeah.
ELAINE Yep. Yeah..
KRAMER You know that, uh, Leslie is in the clothing business? She's a designer.
ELAINE Oh?
KRAMER In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to be the big new look in mens fashions.. It's a, a puffy shirt. Well, yeah, it - it's all puffy. Like the pirates used to wear.
ELAINE Oh, a puffy shirt.
JERRY Puffy.
KRAMER Yeah, see, I think people want to look like pirates. You know, it's the right time for it.. to be all puffy, and devil-may-care..
KRAMER That's true.. I'll be right back.
ELAINE Uh, oh! Jerry's going to be on the "Today" show on Friday.
JERRY Yeah, that's right!
ELAINE Yep.. yep. Um, he's promoting a benefit for Goodwill, you know, they, uh, they clothe the poor, and the homeless..

JERRY Uh-huh.
ELAINE Yep.
JERRY Yep..
ELAINE Mmm
ESTELLE Maybe you should take a civil service test.
GEORGE I'm not taking a civil service test.
FRANK Look at this, George. You ever seen a silver dollar?
GEORGE Yes, I've seen a silver dollar.
ELAINE Why don't you want to take a civil service test?
GEORGE To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want me to do?
FRANK Would you believe when I was 18, I had a silver dollar collection?
ESTELLE I don't understand. You get job security - you get a pay check every week..
GEORGE I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman?
FRANK You know, I couldn't bring myself to spend one of these. I got some kind of a-a-a-a-a phobia.
ESTELLE So what are you gonna do?!
GEORGE I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!
FRANK I bet that collection would be worth a lot of money today.
GEORGE Oh my God..
FRANK I don't like this waiter. Look at him.. He sees us.. he doesn't want to come over.
GEORGE I need some air..
ESTELLE George, where are you going?!
GEORGE I got a lot of thinking to do.
GEORGE Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry..
WOMAN Look at what you've done! You spilled my bag!
GEORGE I, I, I, .. here, let me - let me help you..
WOMAN No, no ,no. It's all right.
GEORGE It - it's just that I'm here with my parents, and my mother wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth, I don't even think I'd pass it.. So..
WOMAN Hmm..
GEORGE What?
WOMAN Your hands.
GEORGE What about them?
WOMAN They're quite exquisite!
GEORGE They are?
WOMAN Extraordinary! Have you ever done any hand modeling?
GEORGE Hand modeling?
WOMAN Here's my card. Why don't you, uh, give me a call?
JERRY I - I don't get it.
GEORGE Me neither!
JERRY What is it?
GEORGE I don't know.
JERRY They're hands!
GEORGE This woman just set me up for a job!
JERRY Well, what about my hands? I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands.
GEORGE What, are you kidding? The knuckles are all out of proportion. you got hair over there - where do you get off comparing your hands to my hands?! This is a one-in-a-million hand.
JERRY Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life.
GEORGE This is it! It happened to me, Jerry! I was sitting in the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking - I couldn't take it any more. I got up, and I bop into this woman..
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER Hey, George!
GEORGE What are you, crazy?! What are you, crazy?!
KRAMER What?!
GEORGE You coulda damaged my hand!
KRAMER But, it's only a toy!
JERRY George has become a hand model.
KRAMER A hand model?
JERRY Yes.
KRAMER Really? Let me look at them..
GEORGE You can look at them, but do NOT touch them.
KRAMER Let's see.. oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet masculine.
GEORGE Alright, I gotta get going.
JERRY Oven mitts?
GEORGE That's all I could find. Would you mind getting the door?
KRAMER Yeah..
JERRY Alright.
GEORGE Thank you very much.
KRAMER You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie. You know, ever since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show, she's been getting all these orders from boutiques and department stores..
JERRY Uh-huh.. Since I said what?
KRAMER Agreed to wear the puffy shirt.
JERRY What are you talking about?
KRAMER When you said that you'd agree to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show.
JERRY This?
KRAMER Yes!
JERRY I agreed to wear this?!
KRAMER Yeah, yeah.
JERRY But, when did I do that?
KRAMER When we went to dinner the other night.
JERRY What are you, crazy?!
KRAMER What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom?
JERRY I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying! I was just nodding!
KRAMER There you go.
JERRY Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national TV, and I said 'Yes'?!
KRAMER Yes, yes! You said it!
JERRY But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't hear her!
KRAMER Well, she asked you.
JERRY I - I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at it! It looks ridiculous!
KRAMER Well, you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking it based on the condition that you're gonna wear this on the TV show! The factory in New Jersey is already makin' them!
JERRY They're making these?!
KRAMER Yes, yes. This pirate trend that she's come up with, Jerry, - this is gonna be the new look for the 90's. You're gonna be the first pirate!
JERRY But, I don't want to be a pirate!
ESTELLE I knew it. I knew it.. I always knew you always had beautiful hands. I used to tell people. Frank, didn't I use to talk about his hands?
FRANK Who the hell did'ya ever mention his hands to?
ESTELLE I mentioned his hands to plenty of people!
FRANK You never mentioned them to me!
GEORGE Hand me an Emory board.
ESTELLE I always talk about your hands - how they're so soft and milky white..
FRANK No! You never said milky white!
ESTELLE I said milky white!
GEORGE Scissor. Don't hand them to me with the point facing out!
ESTELLE I'm sorry.
GEORGE You're sorry?!
ESTELLE I'll try to be more careful.
GEORGE I hope so.
ESTELLE Georgie.. Georgie, would you like some Jell-O?
FRANK Why'd you put the bananas in there?!
ESTELLE George likes the bananas!
FRANK So let him have bananas on the side!
GEORGE Alright! Please, please! I cannot have this constant bickering!.. Stress is very damaging to the epidermis! Now, I have an important photo session in the morning - my hands have got to be in tip-top shape, so please - keep the television down, and the conversation to a minimum.
ESTELLE But Georgie.. what about the Jell-O?
GEORGE I'll take it in my room.
KRAMER Yeah, come in.
STAGEHAND I just wanted to let you know he's got about five minutes.
KRAMER Giddy-Up. Jerry! Five minutes!
KRAMER Now that's a great looking shirt! Ayye Captain! Yeah! I'm glad I ironed it. It's perfect. Look at it! It's fantastic!
JERRY Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?! I can't wear this!
KRAMER Hey, this look's better than anything you own. You know, in two months time, everybody's gonna be wearing the pirate look. Aye!
KRAMER Yeah.
ELAINE Hi, Kramer. Guess what - I just saw Bryant Gumbel, he said he might help out at the benefit!
KRAMER Great.
ELAINE What is that?!
KRAMER It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, eh? Whatd'ya think? Is it cool or what?
ELAINE Why're you wearing that now?
JERRY 'Why am I wearing is now?'? I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now - because the lowtalker asked me to, that's why! And I said 'yes'. Do you know why? Because I couldn't HEAR her!
ELAINE When did she, when did she ask you this?
JERRY When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom.
ELAINE I didn't hear anything.
JERRY Of course not! Nobody hears anything when this woman speaks!
ELAINE Well, you can't wear that on the show.
KRAMER Elaine, you want to stop?
ELAINE Wha- What? No. Jerry, you are promoting a benefit to CLOTHE homeless people. You can't come out dressed like that! You're all puffed up!.. You look like the Count of Monte Cristo!
JERRY I have to wear it! The woman has orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on TV.. they're producing them as we speak!
ELAINE Yeah, but you're supposed to be a compassionate person! That cares about poor people! You look like you're gonna.. swing in on a chandelier!
STAGEHAND Okay, let's go. Is that what you're wearing?
MAN I've never seen hands like these before..
WOMAN They're so soft and milky white.
PHOTOGRAPHER You know who's hands they remind me of? Ray McKigney.
MAN Ugh.. Ray.
PHOTOGRAPHER He was it.
GEORGE Who was he?
PHOTOGRAPHER The most exquisite hands you've ever seen.. Oh, he had it all.
GEORGE What happened to him?
MAN Tragic story, I'm afraid. He could've had any woman in the world.. but none could match the beauty of his own hand.. and that became his one true love..
GEORGE You mean, uh..?
MAN Yes. he was not.. master of his domain.
GEORGE But how.. uh..?
MAN The muscles.. became so strained with.. overuse, that eventually the hand locked into a deformed position, and he was left with nothing but a claw. He traveled the world seeking a cure.. acupuncturists.. herbalists.. swamis.. nothing helped. Towards the end, his hands became so frozen the was unable to manipulate utensils, and was dependent on Cub Scouts to feed him. I hadn't seen another pair of hands like Ray McKigney's.. until today. You are his successor. I.. only hope you have a little more self-control.
GEORGE You don't have to worry about me. I won a contest.
PHOTOGRAPHER Ok, let's get to work.
BRYANT Back now, 7:46. On Tuesday the 19th here in New York there will be a benefit for the Goodwill Industries - a used clothing organization that provides service to the needy. One of the performers will be comedian Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry, good morning.
JERRY Thank you, Bryant.
BRYANT And speaking of clothing , that is a very, very unusual shirt you have on.
JERRY Oh, thank you.
BRYANT You're all kinda, all kinda "puffed up".
JERRY Yeah, it's a puffy shirt.
ALL Happy birthday to you.
WALTER Thanks.
FEMALE_WORKER Elaine, cake?
ELAINE Uh, no, thanks.
FEMALE_WORKER It's Walter's special day.
ELAINE You know, there are 200 people who work in this office. Every day is somebody's special day.
MALE_WORKER Elaine! Where're you going? It's Walter's last day. We have to celebrate.
ELAINE It's his birthday and it's his last day?
MALE_WORKER This is other-Walter, from returns.
OTHER_WALTER Hey, what's going on here?
ALL Surprise!
OTHER_WALTER Oh guys.
OTHER_WALTER Elaine, it's my last day. Have a piece.
ELAINE All right, pile it on.
ALL For he's a jolly good fellow...happy birthday to you...for he's a jolly good fellow...birthday to you...which nobody can deny...
JERRY What is so bad about having a little piece of cake?
ELAINE It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends?
JERRY Why aren't you there now?
ELAINE I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people. By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her.
JERRY You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee messiness.
ELAINE Yeah, you're better off sitting around here, reading comic books, and eating spaghetti at two in the morning..
JERRY Hey, speaking of tomato sauce, you want to come with me and George to Mario's Pizza?
ELAINE Your old high school hangout? Why?
JERRY They're closing. We're going for one last slice.
KRAMER Hey. All right. Hi. Check it out, official police caution tape. Look at that.
KRAMER Uh-uh-uh. Step back, son, there's nothing to see here.
JERRY Where did you get this?
KRAMER Well, I got it from my cop buddy Doug.
JERRY You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any of these people?
KRAMER They want to know why they never see you.
KRAMER I'm gonna eat that later.
JERRY So they just gave you this?
KRAMER Oh no, no,. no. I had to fish around in the evidence room for it. You know, they're all preoccupied, trying to hunt down this new psycho-serial killer, the Lopper. All right, I'll see ya.
ELAINE Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who is the Lopper?
KRAMER Oh, it's no big deal. It's just some guy who's been running around Riverside park-pffff. You know, cutting people's heads off.
JERRY How come I haven't read about this?
KRAMER Well, you know, the police, they've been having some internal dissension about the name.
ELAINE Really? What're the other titles?
KRAMER Uh, Headso...uh...The Denogginizer...Son of dad.
JERRY Son of dad?
KRAMER Yeah. That was my suggestion. It's sort of a catchall.
GEORGE Just as she was. Hey, Mario! Remember us?
MARIO No.
JERRY We used to come in every day.
MARIO So where ya been? We're tanking here.
GEORGE We'll have 2 slices and 2 grape sodas.
MARIO Oh, thanks. That'll save us.
JERRY All right, make it the large sodas.
GEORGE Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger? I used to be so into this game. Gettin' that frog across the street was my entire life.
JERRY Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game.
GEORGE Double jump! Eat the fly! Eat it!
BOY Thanks a lot.
GEORGE Ah, beat it, punk.
JERRY Hey, look at the high score--"G.L.C." George Louis Costanza. That's not you, is it?
GEORGE Yes! 860,000. I can't believe it's still standing. No one has beaten me in like 10 years.
JERRY I remember that night.
GEORGE The perfect combination of Mountain Dew and mozzarella...just the right amount of grease on the joy stick...
MARIO Here's your pizza pea brains.
JERRY I think I remember why we stopped coming here.
ELAINE This pen smells really bad. So why do I keep smelling it? Is it too late for me to go to law school? What is this?
MALE_WORKER You were out sick yesterday, so we got you a get-well cake.
FEMALE_WORKER It's carrot. It's good for you.
WORKERS Get well get well soon, we wish you to get--
ELAINE Stop it! That's not even a song! I mean, now we're celebrating a sick day?
MALE_WORKER I think it's nice.
ELAINE What? What is nice? Trying to fill the void in your life with flour and sugar and egg and vanilla? I mean, we are all unhappy. Do we have to be fat, too? Not you Becky, I know you have a slow metabolism. I don't want one more piece of cake in my office!
WORKER Get well, get well soon--
MALE_WORKER It's not happening.
BECKY Can we still it eat?
JERRY I'll tell you Lisi, I never expected that movie to--
LISI End under water?
JERRY Be that long. I mean, most action movies are--
LISI So much more violent.
JERRY Not as long.
LISI Well, I should probably--
JERRY Get going.
LISI Yeah.
JERRY Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you--
LISI Eight tomorrow?
JERRY Actually, that's--
LISI What you were thinking.
JERRY Right.
GEORGE Oh! Here you are. Ha ha...You, uh, you want to--
JERRY Sure. How about this one?
GEORGE Well, I'm doing it, Jerry. I'm buying the Frogger machine. Now the torch will burn forever.
JERRY Fabulous. See, now you're really do something.
GEORGE So, you want to come down to Mario's Pizza with me and help me pick up the Frogger?
JERRY Hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you move it?
GEORGE What?
JERRY Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased.
GEORGE You're right. Why must there always be a problem? You'd think just once I could get a break. God knows I earned it with that score!
KRAMER Well, more bad news Jerry.
KRAMER You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper in Riverside Park. I saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you.
JERRY Oh, come on. There's a lot of people walking around the city that look like me.
KRAMER Not as many as there used to be.
GEORGE No. I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. H-hello?
KRAMER You know, George, you're not gonna find an electrician like that in the yellow pages. Now, I know just the guy who can do this.
JERRY Another friend?
KRAMER Oh, no, no, no. This guy is no friend. In fact, we don't even get along.
GEORGE Well, is he good, Kramer?
KRAMER Oh, he's the best...and the worst.
GEORGE Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me.
KRAMER Believe me George, you can count on Slippery Pete.
GEORGE Slippery Pete?
KRAMER Yeah, I don't care for the name, either. In fact, that's one of the things that we argue about.
GEORGE All right, I'm gonna find a guy with a truck. GLC must live on!
JERRY Come on.
KRAMER Dng-ga-gng-ga-wt.
JERRY Hello?
ELAINE So how's it going with my friend?
JERRY She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs.
JERRY What is that?
ELAINE Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't realize how hooked I got on that 4:00 sugar rush.
JERRY So join in.
ELAINE I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there.
JERRY All right.
JERRY Hey, wh-what--
KRAMER Yeah. I dropped an egg. Be careful.
ELAINE Anybody here? Peterboy?
ELAINE Ooh, it's a cake walk.
PETERMAN Get well, get well soon we wish you to get well.
PETERMAN Ha ha ha ha...Oh, what a stirring little anthem of wellness.
ELAINE Mr. Peterman, um--
PETERMAN We missed you at the get well party. Poor old Walt has a polyp in the duodenum. It's benign, but--ooh--still a bastard. Oh, Elaine, can you keep a secret?
ELAINE No, sir, I can't.
PETERMAN Inside that small college boy minifridge is my latest acquisition. A slice of cake from the wedding of King Edward VIII to Wallis Simpson, circa 1937, price--$29,000.
JERRY Well Lisi, that was another-
LISI Lovely evening.
JERRY Really bad meal. I was thinking maybe we should--
LISI Go for a hansom cab ride?
JERRY Call it a night. I'll walk you home. Where do you live?
LISI 84th street, right off Riverside Park.
JERRY Riverside Park.
LISI I thought we were going--
JERRY Back to my place. That's right.
GEORGE So you slept with her?
JERRY She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the Lopper, So I let her stay over.
GEORGE And you automatically sleep with her?
JERRY Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--
GEORGE Finished your thought.
ELAINE Guess what I ate.
GEORGE An ostrich burger.
ELAINE No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten.
JERRY How'd it taste?
ELAINE A little stale.
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE So, uh are you sleeping with Peterman?
ELAINE No. He doesn't know I ate it. In fact, he almost caught me. I have to sneak back in and even it out.
GEORGE You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more of it.
ELAINE Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country.
JERRY Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship weekend place.
ELAINE What is going on with you two?
JERRY Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her the wrong message.
GEORGE What's that?
ELAINE 4:00 sugar fix.
JERRY Well, I'm calling this off right now.
ELAINE No, no. You are way past the phone call breakup stage.
JERRY Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper is.
ELAINE Oh...it's daylight. It won't take you that long. Just make a clean break.
ELAINE Just a little off the side...
ELAINE Well, no point in wasting $1,200.
ELAINE Oh, commander, isn't the wedding marvelous? More cake? Oh, I shouldn't. I mustn't. Ah, what the hell?
GEORGE Now, each of you is here because you're the best at what you do.
GEORGE Slippery Pete, Kramer tells me you are one hell of a rogue electrician. And shlomo, you're the best truck driver.
SHLOMO I don't know If I'm the best.
GEORGE Oh...you're very good.
SHLOMO Let's say "good."
GEORGE Ok. Good. And Kramer, you're in charge of taping off the loading zone.
KRAMER Lock and load.
SLIPPERY_PETE You think you can handle that, numb nuts?
KRAMER All right, all right, come on, now.
SLIPPERY_PETE That was my mail-order bride.
KRAMER Hey, you weren't home, so I signed for her.
SLIPPERY_PETE It doesn't give you the right to make out with her.
KRAMER You weren't even married yet.
GEORGE All right, all right, calm down, calm down. Whatever happened in the past is past.
GEORGE Now, this is the basic layout for Mario's Pizza.
SHLOMO So what kind of jail time are we looking at if we're caught?
GEORGE What do you mean?
SLIPPERY_PETE We're stealing this thing, right?
GEORGE No. I--I paid for it.
SLIPPERY_PETE I thought we were stealing it.
KRAMER Yeah. It feels like we're stealing it.
GEORGE We're not stealing it.
SHLOMO I definitely thought we're stealing it.
GEORGE All right, let's--let's focus. Can we get back to the plan?
SLIPPERY_PETE Well, I need a battery for this kind of a job. Can I at least steal a battery?
GEORGE Fine. Steal the battery. Now, all right, here is the Frogger. This is the front door, and this is the outlet.
SLIPPERY_PETE What's that?
GEORGE The outlet?
SLIPPERY_PETE Mm-hmm.
GEORGE That's where the electricity comes out.
SLIPPERY_PETE Oh, you mean the holes.
SHLOMO Which one's the bathroom?
GEORGE Uh, here.
SHLOMO They put the Frogger with the toilet? Yecchh.
GEORGE The Frogger is here.
KRAMER George, I thought that was the door.
SLIPPERY_PETE Where are all the pizza ovens?
SHLOMO I thought the bathroom was here.
GEORGE All right. You understand now? It's not that complicated.
ELAINE I need to replace an antique piece of cake.
ELAINE Do you have anything that's been...you know, laying around for a while? Something prewar would be just great.
KRAMER Oh, hey, Elaine. What, you got the munchies?
ELAINE Oh, Kramer, I am in big. big, big trouble. I need a cake that looks like this.
KRAMER Oh, yeah--Sotheby's. Yeah. They make good cake.
ELAINE Do any of these look close?
KRAMER No, but I know I've seen cake just like that. Oh--Entenmann's. Yeah.
ELAINE Entenmann's? From the supermarket?
KRAMER Well, no. They're not really in the supermarket. Yeah, they got their own case at the end of the aisle.
JERRY Hi, Lisi.
LISI Hi, honey. Is that a bat?
JERRY Uh, yeah. I found it on the street. It's gotta be worth something.
LISI So, what do you want to do, Sweetheart?
JERRY Well, before we do anything...maybe we should talk.
JERRY Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing comes out of nowhere. I mean, how am I supposed to respond to that?
LISI Then may I say something... without being interrupted?
JERRY Well I'm sorry if I ruined your life. That's exactly what I set out to do.
LISI Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh...
LISI Are you afraid to kiss me in public?
JERRY Have we even been in public?
LISI So now you're going to tell me what I'm thinking. Well, go ahead, 'cause I'd really like to know.
JERRY You are not dumb. Don't say that..
JERRY These beans are pretty good.
LISI 20 minutes.
JERRY Well, I'm sorry I'm not Brad. I'm me!
JERRY Nice to meet ya!
LISI Boy, did your mother do a number on you.
LISI Fine. So it's over.
JERRY Oh, thank god. Why is it dark out? What time is it?
LISI 9:30.
JERRY We've been breaking up for 10 hours?
LISI Good-bye, Jerry.
JERRY Lopper. You know, Lisi, maybe we should give this a little more time. See how it looks in the light of day.
LISI Out!
JERRY Lopper.
JERRY Lisi, Lisi. Let me in! We can work this out. I was wrong, you were right. I'll do anything!
GEORGE Jerry, you came for the big moment.
JERRY No. I'm waiting for...
GEORGE Ha ha. Everything's timed out to perfection, Jerry. Slippery Pete's got the Frogger running on battery power, the truck will be there any minute, and Kramer's taped out the loading zone.
JERRY Oh. Sounds great.
GEORGE Yeah, yeah. You gotta come over tonight. We can play.
JERRY Oh, I can't. I'm busy. I'm going away on a long weekend.
GEORGE Where?
LISI Look what I found. I got one for you, too.
JERRY Great. Uh, you know what? Why don't you put it in the car so I don't toss it in that dumpster?
LISI Ha ha. Ok. I'll meet thee in front of your place, 15 minutes.
JERRY A long, long weekend.
GEORGE I hear thee.
PETERMAN Elaine! Excellent. I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Irwin Lubeck.
ELAINE Oh, hello.
LUBECK Charmed.
PETERMAN All right, brace yourself, Lubeck. You are about to be launched via pastry back to the wedding of one of the most dashing and romantic Nazi sympathizers of the entire British Royal family.
ELAINE I guess I'll just--
PETERMAN Oh, no Elaine, stay. Lubeck here is the world's foremost appraiser of vintage pastry.
PETERMAN All right, Lubeck. How much is she worth?
LUBECK I'd say about 219.
PETERMAN Ha ha ha ha ha!$219,000! Lubeck, you glorious titwillow. You just made me a profit of $190,000.
LUBECK No, $2.19. It's an Entenmann's.
PETERMAN Do they have a castle at Windsor?
LUBECK No. They have a display case at the end of the aisle.
PETERMAN Oh, good lord.
LUBECK You all right, Peterman? You look ill.
ELAINE Get well, get well soon, we want you to get well. Get well, get well soon we want you to get well.
GEORGE What are you guys doing?
SHLOMO Eat the fly. Eat the fly. Got him!
GEORGE You idiots. You're gonna wear down the battery.
SLIPPERY_PETE The batteries are fine. We've got...oh, god. only 3 minutes left.
GEORGE Quick. Get this thing back in the pizzeria
KRAMER George, they closed up.
GEORGE I need an outlet!
SLIPPERY_PETE A what?
GEORGE Holes! I need holes!
KRAMER The pharmacy's still open.
GEORGE All right. Kramer, you block off traffic. You to go sweet-talk the pharmacist.
SLIPPERY_PETE You owe me a quarter.
GEORGE Slippery Pete. Kramer, hurry up!
KRAMER Ahh! I'm out! No tape left!
JERRY Well, come on George, I'll help you push it across.
GEORGE Wait a minute. This looks familiar. This reminds me of something. I can do this.
JERRY By yourself?
GEORGE Jerry, I've been preparing for this moment my entire life.
SHLOMO He looks like a Frog.
SLIPPERY_PETE So do you.
JERRY Game over.
ELAINE Mr. Peterman, you wanted to see me, sir?
PETERMAN Elaine, up until a moment ago, I was convinced that I was on the receiving end of one of the oldest baker's grift in the books--The Entenmann's shim-sham.
ELAINE Ohh...
PETERMAN Until I remembered the videotape surveillance system that I installed to catch other-Walter using my latrine. But it also caught this.
ELAINE Mr. Peterman, I, uh...
PETERMAN Elaine, I have a question for you. Is the item still...with you?
ELAINE Um...as far as I know.
PETERMAN Do you know what happens to a butter-based frosting after six decades in a poorly ventilated English basement?
ELAINE Uh, I guess I hadn't--
PETERMAN Well, I have a feeling that what you are about to go through is punishment enough. Dismissed.
ELAINE I can't believe I'm going out with this guy. Wow! He's so cool. Maybe he'll write a song about me. That would be amazing. Oh, Elaine, you are so beautiful. So, so beautiful. Not so mention your personality which is so, so, interesting. If you want, you can quit your job and never work again.
ELAINE Jerry, you have got to come see him. He is so terrific.
JERRY Maybe he'll write a song about you.
ELAINE Yeah. Right. Like that really matters.
JERRY So I take it he's spongeworthy?
ELAINE Oh, yeah.
JERRY Well, he's a musician. I guess they're supposed to be very, you know, uninhibited and free.
ELAINE Well, actually, he's - he's not that way at all.
JERRY Oh, no?
ELAINE Yeah. In fact, he....
JERRY Come on. Come on.
ELAINE I don't wanna!
JERRY Elaine, you're among friends.
ELAINE Well, actually, he, um, doesn't really like to do... everything.
JERRY Oh.
ELAINE Yeah. It's surprising.
JERRY Yes, it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you?
ELAINE No. No, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it would be nice. I'm not gonna lie to you and say it wouldn't be nice.
JERRY Sure. Why not? You're there.
ELAINE Exactly.
JERRY But you said he was just coming out of a very serious relationship. Maybe he's, you know, still....kind of...he...not gonna happen.
KRAMER Hey, Jerry! Listen, I need you to come downstairs, help me get my stuff outta the car.
JERRY What stuff?
KRAMER I just came from the price club. I'm loaded up, baby.
JERRY All right. What are you, outta your mind? Look at this. What did you buy here? You will never be able to finish all this stuff.
KRAMER Course I will. These are staples.
JERRY A four-pound can of black olives? That's a staple?
KRAMER Lindsay olives, Jerry.
JERRY A forty-eight pack of Eggo waffles? A gallon of barbecue sauce? Ten pounds of cocktail meatballs?
KRAMER $17.50. You can't beat that.
JERRY Look...look at this can of tuna!
KRAMER Yeah. Star Kist, Jerry. Most tuna don't make their cut.
JERRY This isn't for a person. This is for Biosphere 3.
KRAMER Hey, Clyde!
CLYDE Hey, Kramer! What's happening, dude?
KRAMER Yeah. Ahh. Hey, this is Jerry here.
CLYDE How ya doin'?
JERRY Hi.
KRAMER You know, Clyde, he plays backup with John Germaine.
JERRY John Germaine? That is amazing. I was just talking about him upstairs with Elaine.
CLYDE Oh yeah?
JERRY Oh, yeah. My friend Elaine and him are goin' out. They're pretty hot and heavy.
CLYDE Is that right?
KRAMER Hey, how 'bout giving me a hand? You know, bring some of this stuff upstairs.
CLYDE Oh, sorry Kramer, I got to watch the hands. My hands are my life.
ESTELLE Georgie, can you zip me up?
GEORGE Yeah. Yeah, one second.
ESTELLE Well, come on!
GEORGE All right. All right. Let's not get into panic mode! Let's not make a big deal outta this thing or we're never gonna get through this night.
ESTELLE Well, I'm meeting your in-laws, I think I should look nice.
GEORGE My in-laws. Oh, my....
FRANK So, what do you think? Your old man can look pretty good when he wants to, huh?
ESTELLE I don't like that tie.
FRANK What's the matter with this tie? I've hardly worn it.
ESTELLE It's too thin. They're wearing wide now.
FRANK How do you know what kind of ties they wear?
ESTELLE Go to any office building on 7th Avenue and tell me if there's anyone there wearing a thin tie like that. Go ahead!
FRANK Oh, get the hell outta here. 7th Avenue.
ESTELLE George, do you think he should wear a tie like that?
FRANK Huh?
GEORGE I think he should wear whatever tie he wants.
FRANK We gotta stop off and pick up a marble rye from Schnitzer's.
ESTELLE It's out of our way. Why can't we pick up something at Lord's? It's right over here.
FRANK No! We have to go to Schnitzer's! I'll show these people something about taste!
GEORGE This is gonna be fun.
JERRY Hey, you'll never guess who I bumped into. This guy Clyde. He's in your friend John Germaine's band there.
ELAINE So what did he have to say?
JERRY Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy.
ELAINE Hot and heavy? You said hot and heavy?
JERRY Yeah.
ELAINE What did you do that for?
JERRY What?
ELAINE What if he tells John? Then John's gonna think that I think that we're hot and heavy. I don't want John thinking that I'm hot and heavy if he's not hot and heavy.
JERRY Oh
ELAINE I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me here. I don't wanna make any big, sudden movements. I'll frighten him away.
JERRY Well, Clyde might not tell him.
ELAINE How do you know that?
JERRY I should have helped Kramer with those packages.
ELAINE Ohh!
DENNIS Let me give you a hand. Hey, Kramer. I wonder, could you do me a favor? I'm taking the family to Disneyworld next week. I wonder...
KRAMER Uh-huh.
DENNIS I wonder, could you pick up my mail?
KRAMER Yeah. Sure. Sure.
DENNIS In fact, you know what, how would you like to take my hansom cab for the week?
KRAMER Drive the horse?
DENNIS It'll just be sitting there. You can really clean up. 500 bucks a day. I'll split it with ya.
KRAMER Oh, giddyup. Yeah.
GEORGE This is delicious, Mrs. Ross.
MRS._ROSS Oh.
MR._ROSS What are you complimenting her for? She didn't make it Rowenna did.
FRANK What is this thing anyway?
MRS._ROSS It's Cornish gamehen.
FRANK What is that, like a little chicken?
GEORGE It's, uh, it's not a little chicken. Little chicken. It's a gamebird.
FRANK Gamebird?
GEORGE Yeah.
FRANK What do you mean? Like, you - you hunt it?
MR._ROSS Yes.
FRANK How hard could it be to kill this thing?
ESTELLE I couldn't help but notice that you have quite a library in there.
MRS._ROSS If I had a dime for every book he's actually read, I'd be broke.
SUSAN More wine anyone?
FRANK Yeah. I'll take some.
SUSAN Hmmm?
FRANK Thank you.
SUSAN How do you like the Merlot?
ESTELLE Merlot? I never heard of it. Did they just invent it?
MRS._ROSS Oh, mother.
GEORGE She's, uh, she's heard of Merlot.
FRANK Let me understand, you got the hen, the chicken and the rooster. The rooster goes with the chicken. So, who's having sex with the hen?
GEORGE Why don't we talk about it another time.
FRANK But you see my point here? You only hear of a hen, a rooster and a chicken. Something's missing!
MRS._ROSS Something's missing all right.
MR._ROSS They're all chickens. The rooster has sex with all of them.
FRANK That's perverse.
GEORGE Did anybody see Firestorm?
MR._ROSS Firestorm, that's a hell of a picture.
GEORGE Yeah.
MR._ROSS Remember when they had the helicopter land on top of that car --
FRANK Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! I haven't seen it yet.
MR._ROSS It doesn't have anything to do with the plot!
FRANK Still! Still! I like to go in fresh!
GEORGE Oh mother of God.
KRAMER Of course, uh, this is Central Park. Uh, this was designed in 1850 by Joe Peppitone. Um, built during the Civil War so the northern armies could practice fighting on...on grass. Oh, yeah. Giddyup. On Rusty!
JOHN Thank you. Now, I'd like to play something th -- well, actually, it's my latest so it's nice and fresh. It's called " Hot And Heavy."
GEORGE Thank God that's over.
ESTELLE The mother seems to hit the sauce pretty hard. I didn't like that.
FRANK And who doesn't serve cake after a meal? What kind of people? Would it kill them to put out a pound cake? Something!
GEORGE So, they didn't give you a piece of cake? Big deal.
ESTELLE It is a big deal. You're supposed to serve cake after a meal. I'm sorry. It's impolite.
FRANK Not impolite...it's stupid, that's what it is. You gotta be stupid to do something like that!
ESTELLE Your father's absolutely right. We're sitting there like idiots drinking coffee without a piece of cake!
GEORGE What is this? The marble rye?
MRS._ROSS Oh, dear. I forgot to put out that - that bread they brought.
ESTELLE We forgot to bring it in.
FRANK No, I brought it in. They never put it out.
MRS._ROSS Where is it?
SUSAN I don't know. Where'd you put it?
MRS._ROSS Right over there.
SUSAN Well, it's gone.
GEORGE You stole the bread?
FRANK What do you mean stole? It's my bread. They didn't eat it. Why should I leave it there?
GEORGE Because we brought it for them!
FRANK Apparently, it wasn't good enough for them to serve.
MRS._ROSS Is it possible they took it back?
SUSAN Who would bring a bread and take it back?
MR._ROSS Those people, that's who. I think they're sick.
ESTELLE People take buses to get that rye.
GEORGE Maybe they forgot to put it out!
FRANK Aw, they didn't forget to put it out! It's deliberate! Deliberate, I tell ya!
JERRY He stole back the rye?
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY Why?
GEORGE Why? Why? 'Cause he's off his rocker! That's why.
JERRY So, do the Ross's know?
GEORGE I don't know. They're all very suspicious.
JERRY Why wouldn't they be? A rye bread doesn't just disappear.
GEORGE Now, because of that stupid rye bread, I gotta keep them all separated for the rest of my life.
JERRY Bad situation.
GEORGE I'll tell you what I'd like to do. I'd like to replace that rye.
JERRY What do you mean replace it?
GEORGE You know, you go out, you get another rye. Of course, it would have to be the same one from Schnitzer's. You put it in the kitchen somewhere and you say Ohh! There it is.
JERRY Well, there ya go. What's so hard about that?
GEORGE What's so hard about that? How am I supposed to get it in there? I can't just walk in with it. I have to get the Rosses out of the apartment!
JERRY All right. All right. Don't panic. Let's just think about it. Get the Ross's out of the apartment. That can't be so hard. Wait a minute. Wait a second. Wait a second! You know, Kramer's been driving that hansom cab.
GEORGE So?
JERRY Well, Kramer'll take them around for a while.
GEORGE And it's their anniversary Friday night. I could send them for a hansom cab ride. Y -- you think they'd like that?
JERRY Are you kidding? People love it. There's something about the clip clop, clip clop. They're nuts for it.
GEORGE So, they go off for the ride, by the time they come back the bread is there.
JERRY What about Susan?
GEORGE She's working late that night. We're - were supposed to have dinner with everybody at eight o'clock so I'll set up the ride for seven o'clock.
JERRY Beautiful!
GEORGE You think Kramer'll do it?
KRAMER Of course I'll do it. I'd be happy to. So, all I gotta do is be there at seven?
GEORGE Yeah. Just take 'em out and ride 'em around for about..half an hour.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY What the hell are you doing there?
KRAMER It's Beef-A-Reeno..and I got fifty cans. You want some?
JERRY No. No thanks.
KRAMER Jerry, I think I bought too much at that price club. I don't have any room for it all.
GEORGE Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute. How am I gonna get the rye bread into the apartment?
JERRY Just put it under your shirt.
GEORGE Have you ever seen a Schnitzer's rye? It - it's huge!
JERRY I'll tell ya what, I'll bring it over. I'll stop by Schnitzer's, I'll come by five after seven right after they leave.
GEORGE Oh, this is all locking in now. It is all locking in!
ELAINE Hey. Is that your horse outside?
KRAMER Yeah. That's Rusty.
GEORGE What? He's outside?
KRAMER Uh-huh.
GEORGE Aw, come on. I wanna go see him.
KRAMER You wanna go see him?
GEORGE Yeah. Hey! Hey!
KRAMER I'll show ya Rusty.
GEORGE Hey, Lainey, wanna see the horsey?
ELAINE Well, you really did me in this time, didn't ya? First guy I like in a really long time. I mean, we're getting along, everything is just great. I mean, all right, so he doesn't do... everything, and then you have to come along with your hot and your heavy.
JERRY So, you think Clyde told him?
ELAINE He wrote a song about it!
JERRY Well, maybe it's a good thing.
ELAINE No! It's not a good thing! It's a bad thing! Do you know what this is like? To have no control over a relationship? And - and you feel sick to your stomach all the time? Do you know what that's like?
JERRY No, but I've read articles and I must say it, doesn't sound very pleasant.
ELAINE You know, one of these days, something terrible is gonna happen to you. It has to!
JERRY No. I'm gonna be just fine, but as far as your situation, you're seeing him tonight so talk to him about it.
ELAINE I can't! He's got a big showcase for record producers at his late show tonight. I don't wanna upset him. Aw, what the hell, I'll upset him.
MR._ROSS Yeah George, I gotta tell ya, this is a very nice gesture. We really appreciate it.
GEORGE Aw, well, you know, it's your anniversary. It's - it's the least I can do. I - I just want you guys to go out and have a good time. Ha ha. So, you think we should, uh, we should get downstairs?
MR._ROSS Oh, we got about twenty minutes. You, uh, seem a little nervous George. Anything wrong?
GEORGE Oh, no. No. No. No. No. Nothing. I'm fine. Everything's fine. Fine. Just get a little nervous on the weekends, that's all. Could I, uh, could I get a glass of water?
MRS._ROSS We've got water. I don't think we have any bread, but we've got water.
KRAMER Yeah. There ya go. That's Beef-A-Reeno. I'm so keen-o On Beef-A-Reeno What a delicious cuisine-o Fit for a king and queen-o! Yeah. Eat up. I got thirty four more cans.
MR._ROSS Nice night for a hansom cab ride, 'ay George?
MRS._ROSS You know, George we haven't done anything romantic like this in ....years.
GEORGE Oh my God, it's 7:01. What have I done? My whole plan is depending on Kramer? Have I learned nothing? How could I make such a stupid mistake? He'll never show up!
KRAMER Ah ha!
GEORGE There he is. Right on time as usual.
COUNTER_WOMAN 53.
MABEL 53. I'd like a marble rye, no plastic, in a bag.
COUNTER_WOMAN Ah! You're lucky. It's our last one.
JERRY Wait a second, that's your last marble rye?
COUNTER_WOMAN That's right.
JERRY There's none left?
COUNTER_WOMAN That's what I said. Number 54.
JERRY Uh, excuse me. I know this is gonna sound crazy but I - I have to have that rye. It's a - it's a long story, but a person's whole future may depend on it.
MABEL Well, I'm sorry, but you should have got here earlier.
JERRY Yes. Well, be that as it may, if you could just find it in yourself to give it up.
MABEL You're not getting this rye --
JERRY All right. All right. I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do, I will give you double what you paid for it.
MABEL You're in my way!
KRAMER Ahh! Mr. Ross. Mrs. Ross. My name is Cosmo and I'll be your driver for this evening. We have blankets for your comfort. I also have hot chocolate if the mood should strike you.
MRS._ROSS My favorite.
KRAMER Well, if we're all set to go, why don't you two hop aboard and let me show you a little taste of old New York...the way it once was. Oh, happy anniversary. On, Rusty!
JERRY All right. Look, I'll tell ya what, I'll give you $50. Now, be reasonable you cannot turn down $50 for a $6 rye.
MABEL No? Watch me.
JERRY Give me that rye!
MABEL Stop it!
JERRY I want that rye, lady!
MABEL Help! Someone help!
JERRY Shut up, you old bag!
MABEL Stop thief! Stop him! He's got my marble rye!
ELAINE I'm sorry to just show up unexpectedly like this. I know you've got your big showcase coming up later and I know how important it is, I know how hard you work for this night, but I just had to tell you that I never told Jerry hot and heavy. I didn't think we were hot and heavy. I mean - I mean, who's hot and who's heavy?
JOHN Whoa. Hold on, Elaine I.....I'm kinda disappointed.
ELAINE Disappointed?
JOHN Yeah. I mean, I was excited when Clyde told me that.
ELAINE You were?
JOHN Absolutely.
ELAINE Ohh! Whew! I am so relieved!
JOHN Listen, uh, I've still got a couple of hours to kill before the next show. My place is only a few blocks from here.
ELAINE Really?
JOHN And you know what?
ELAINE What?
JOHN I've been thinking about what we do and I'm thinking..of...adding a new number to my, you know, repertoire.
ELAINE Ohh!
KRAMER Y'aah!
MRS._ROSS What is that?
MR._ROSS I think it's the horse.
MRS._ROSS Oh, God.
KRAMER Hey, how's everything? You..you need anything?
MRS._ROSS This is - this is...horrible.
MR._ROSS Excuse me,...what do you feed this animal?
KRAMER Oh, you know, oats and hay. You know, they like that stuff.
MRS._ROSS I can't take this. Let me out of this thing!
MR._ROSS Turn this thing around. We've had it. We can't breathe back here! And hurry it up!
KRAMER Rusty! Rusty!
GEORGE 
KRAMER Whoa!
GEORGE Wha - what happened? What are you doing back so soon?
MR._ROSS Ask Rusty.
KRAMER I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Ross. One never knows how the gastrointestinal workings of the equine are going to function.
MRS._ROSS Thanks for nothing! Come on, George. Let's go upstairs.
GEORGE What the hell happened?
KRAMER The horse is gassy. Must have been the Beef-A-Reeno.
GEORGE Beef-A-Reeno? You fed the horse Beef-A-Reeno?!
KRAMER Well, I overbought!
MR._ROSS George.
GEORGE 
MUSIC_GUY What's going on? Where is he?
MANAGER Uh...he'll be here soon.
MUSIC_GUY I'll give him ten more minutes. I'm not gonna stay here all night.
JERRY How much did you give him?
KRAMER Just a can. But he really liked it, though.
GEORGE Jerry! Up here!
JERRY Yeah. Hey, what do you want me to do with this?
GEORGE I can't come out. They're standing right by the door. Throw it up!
JERRY Really?
GEORGE Yeah. Yeah. It's the only way. Come on. What are you, kidding me?
JERRY Will you get this horse outta here. He's killing me. I can't get any oxygen.
KRAMER I don't wanna go back on there!
GEORGE Come on!
JERRY 
GEORGE Hey! Hey, wait a second. I got an idea.
ELAINE No. No. Don't be silly, John, you were very good. You just don't have to try so hard. Good luck, honey.
GEORGE Come on! Come on!
JERRY Wait a second! I never baited a hook with a rye before. Your hook is too small. This is for, like, a muffin. All right. Take it away.
GEORGE Come on. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Yeah.
MANAGER Ladies and gentlemen, John Germaine.
KRAMER Well, that was alright, huh?
EMILY Yeah.
KRAMER Well, um, goodnight.
EMILY Goodnight.
KRAMER Look at this.
HELEN Jerry, we can only stay four days.
JERRY Well, I'm upset, but we'll make the most of it.
MORTY Helen, did you pack my travel gym?
HELEN Yes. Oh, your father bought a exercise device off the television. He does it every morning at four.
MORTY Only twenty-five minutes a day, and you can attach it to any doorknob.
JERRY Huh. So, I guess your travel miles are about to expire.
HELEN Well, actually, Jerry, we wanted to talk to you about something.
JERRY Am I finally getting a baby brother?
HELEN Jerry, be serious.
MORTY How would you feel if we sold the Cadillac?
JERRY What? The Cadillac I bought for you?
MORTY It's too much car, Jerry.
JERRY Aw, c'mon, you love that car. What about the Northstar system?
MORTY I don't think we even use it.
JERRY Well, it's a gift and I want you to keep it.
HELEN We already sold it.
JERRY Wh..why didn't you tell me before you sold it?
MORTY Because we had a buyer, and we couldn't get a free flight until now.
HELEN Well, we could, but we wanted the bulkhead.
JERRY Ugh.
KRAMER Man, that Emily is wearing me out.
JERRY Kramer.
KRAMER No, no, no. It's not the sex, Jerry. Heyy! Seinfelds.
HELEN Hi Kramer.
MORTY Hiya Kramer.
JERRY We're in the middle of a discussion here.
KRAMER Oh yeah? What about?
HELEN Jerry's upset we sold the Cadillac.
KRAMER What'd you get for it?
MORTY Jack Klompus gave us six grand.
JERRY You sold my Cadillac to Jack Klompus?
MORTY And we want you to have the money.
JERRY I don't need the money.
MORTY What're you talking about? You had a cheque bounce at the bodega.
JERRY Oh, is that what this is all about?! I bounce a cheque and you sold a Cadillac?!
HELEN Well, also, Jerry, we read an article in the Sun Sentinel. It says standup comedy is not what it used to be, what with def jam and all.
KRAMER Yeah, that def jam is a force.
HELEN Jerry, you know, I hear wonderful things about Bloomingdales' executive training program.
JERRY Oh my god.
KRAMER Y'know you've given this comedy thing your best shot. Yeah, you had some good observations, but it's over. Now, this Bloomingdale thing, that could be the next wave.
GEORGE Uh, excuse me. Uh, pound of Arabian mocha java, please.
ELAINE So, you understand how my Peterman stock options are gonna work?
GEORGE I'm going to the bathroom.
ELAINE Just, very interesting.
JERRY Yeah, when it's your money, it's fascinating.
COUNTERPERSON Arabian mocha java?
ELAINE Mmm. Oh, um, I got it.
JERRY That Arabian is strong coffee.
ELAINE It's PLO blend.
ELAINE Ohh, I got your coffee.
GEORGE Oh Oh, here, lemme uh...
ELAINE Nah, nah, it's on me. Aww, man. Okay, listen guys, I'm gonna be late. I'll see you, okay?
GEORGE Yeah.
ELAINE Bye.
GEORGE Mmm.
GEORGE You see what just happened here?
JERRY What?
GEORGE She treated me to the Arabian mocha java.
JERRY And you misinterpret this how?
GEORGE She's stickin' it to me that she makes more money than me.
JERRY I'm sure she was just being nice, buying you the coffee.
GEORGE No, not nice. She's stickin' it to me.
JERRY You're crazy.
GEORGE Stickin' it to me, Jerry.
JERRY George.
GEORGE Stickin' it!
GEORGE So you're buying the car back for your parents?
JERRY I'm flying down to Florida tomorrow.
GEORGE Your parents'll never let you do it.
JERRY They lied to me about selling the car. I'll lie to them about buying it back. They think they can dump six grand on me? Think again.
GEORGE What kind of money you think your parents have?
JERRY Excuse me?
GEORGE I bet they have more money than mine.
JERRY Come on, your parents have money.
GEORGE You think?
JERRY When did they ever spend any money?
GEORGE Never.
JERRY What are their living expenses?
GEORGE Nothing.
JERRY Where do they ever go on vacation?
GEORGE Nowhere.
GEORGE How much money d'you think they have?
JERRY Few hundred grand?
GEORGE You're saying I stand to inherit three hundred thousand dollars, is that what you're saying?!
JERRY Course you may not see it for twenty years.
GEORGE Twenty years? That long?
JERRY Does your father still eat bacon and eggs every day?
GEORGE Fortunately, yes.
JERRY How's your family history?
GEORGE I have an aunt that died at seven.
JERRY Really?
GEORGE Aunt Baby.
KRAMER Elaine. Uh, you got a moment?
ELAINE Yeah, Kramer, come on in.
KRAMER I, uh, need to speak to you about some lady problems.
ELAINE Oh-kay.
KRAMER You know, after I have sex with Emily, uh, I don't want her in the bed any more.
ELAINE Ah.
KRAMER Yeah, because she's throwing off my whole sleep. She's got the jimmy legs.
ELAINE Jimmy legs?
KRAMER Jimmy leg.
ELAINE Ohh.
KRAMER So, uh, well, maybe I should just be honest with her, huh?
ELAINE Tell her after sex, you just want her outta there?
KRAMER Well, I'd say it nicely.
ELAINE I don't think so.
KRAMER Well, you know, I really like this girl and I, you know, I think if I could just work out this one thing...
ELAINE Yeah. I gotta be honest with you Kramer. You might be more than just a coupla tweaks away from a healthy relationship.
KRAMER Well you're not exactly zeroing in yourself, lady.
ELAINE Alright, get out.
ELAINE Get out!
JERRY So listen, I gotta go down to Atlantic City. I'm performing at Bally's.
MORTY You just heard about this today?
JERRY They had a cancellation and they instantly called me.
HELEN Who cancelled?
JERRY Carrot Top. I told you, my career's fine.
GEORGE I been, uh, thinking about the family. Tell me, uh, about Aunt Baby.
FRANK She's deceased.
GEORGE Yeah. Uhm, why did she die so young?
FRANK She had problems. Internal.
GEORGE Is that common in our family?
ESTELLE Well, your uncle Moe, he died a young man.
FRANK Also internal problems.
ESTELLE It's that temper on your side. They're yelling and yelling, and then one day, they're all gone.
FRANK What about your side? Your cousin Hennie. She was sickly from the moment I met her!
ESTELLE Don't you talk about Hennie!
GEORGE I guess you two are the lucky ones.
FRANK So far.
ESTELLE Frank, if Aunt Baby were alive today, how old would she be?
FRANK She'd never make it.
EMILY So let me get this straight. You enjoy the lovemaking...
KRAMER Shh, shh.
EMILY Well, do you?
KRAMER Oh yeah, like strawberry pie.
EMILY Okay, but you have a problem sharing a bed with me?
KRAMER I know it's not what the ladies like. But without some solid sack time, I'm a zombie.
EMILY I don't know.
KRAMER Aww, c'mon, man. Meet me halfway.
EMILY You're not easy, Kramer.
KRAMER I know.
JACK So, to what do I owe the pleasure of this, unannounced, visit?
JERRY I wanna buy back the Cadillac.
JACK You wanna buy it back? Why, you go drugs hidden in the trunk?
JACK I'm kidding.
JERRY Alright, I'll give you nine thousand for it.
JACK Nine thousand for a Cadillac? It's got no miles on it.
JERRY You bought it for six!
JACK You're not me.
JERRY How much d'you want for it?
JACK The Kelly blue book value. Twenty-two thousand dollars.
JERRY Fourteen thousand.
JACK Done. But, I get to drive it tomorrow, because Doris wants to go to Naples.
JACK Need a pen?
JACK Still works.
KRAMER Hey, where's Jerry?
HELEN He's performing at Bally's in Atlantic City.
KRAMER Aw, okay. Yeah, I need his shoeshine kit. He always hides it from me. Yeah, Bally's? Yeah, Jerry Seinfeld's room, please.
MORTY You know that number?
KRAMER I used to have a problem. Well, what d'you mean, he's not registered? Wha..s, e, i, n, v...
HELEN f. f, e, l , d.
KRAMER ...f, e, l, d. Well, I think you're wrong. Alright, you have a lucky day, too.
HELEN He's not there?
KRAMER No, they never heard of him.
ELAINE This is so nice of you to take us all out to dinner, George.
GEORGE Well, as much as I enjoy all the good-natured ribbing, nothing really makes me happier than spending money on the people I care about.
HELEN Where's Jerry?
GEORGE Oh, he'll be here. By the way, Elaine, thank you for laying out for the Arabian mocha java.
ELAINE George, you didn't have to do this. I'm president of a big company. I can afford to buy you coffee.
MORTY President?
ELAINE Yeah.
GEORGE Hey look, he's back.
JERRY I got your message, so I came straight from Atlantic City.
HELEN Jerry, Kramer called Bally's. You weren't registered.
JERRY Well, I can't stay under my own name. I was registered under Slappy White.
GEORGE Mom? Dad?
ESTELLE Well, look who's here. Hello, Seinfelds.
GEORGE Wh..what're you doing here?
FRANK We're having an upscale dinner.
GEORGE What?
ESTELLE Well, after talking to you, we realised we may not have much time left.
FRANK So, we're blowing it all.
FRANK Look George, it's a Pierre Cardin.
KRAMER That was alright.
EMILY Yeah.
KRAMER Well, I'll see you.
JERRY Hello.
JACK Jerry, I had a little mishap with the car.
JACK I'm down here in alligator alley. You better get down here.
JERRY Huh. Alright.
HELEN Who was that?
JERRY That was the Golden Nugget. Also in Atlantic City. They heard such good things about my show at Bally's, they want me for tonight. So I'll have to repack, and go.
MORTY That didn't sound like the Golden Nugget.
HELEN I'm worried. What happens if we have to support Jerry?
MORTY I'd have to go back to work.
HELEN Where would you work?
MORTY Maybe I should talk to Elaine.
ELAINE Well, Mr Seinfeld, I..I'm not sure I understand why you want a job here.
MORTY What's not to understand?
ELAINE Well, for one thing, you live in Florida.
MORTY I'm very comfortable working outta the house. I have a phone, we have a Kinko's nearby. You know, I think that my resume speaks for itself.
ELAINE Where is your resume?
MORTY I don't have it. I'll mail you one.
ELAINE Alright, Mr Seinfeld, I... What kind of position did you have in mind?
MORTY You sell clothes here, don't you?
ELAINE Yeah.
MORTY Well, I sold raincoats in the garment centre for thirty-eight years. In nineteen forty-nine...
ELAINE Alright. Alright, alright. You come in tomorrow, we'll find something for you to do.
MORTY You won't regret this, Miss Benes. What time should I be in? I get up at four, I could be here as early as four twenty-five.
ELAINE Uhm...
PETERMAN Oh, Elaine, this dry air is curing me like a Black Forest ham.
ELAINE Mr Peterman. You're back.
MORTY Who's Mr Fancy?
KRAMER I uh, I was thinking maybe I should spend the night.
EMILY Aww, that's sweet, but actually I, I think I'd prefer it if you left.
KRAMER What?
EMILY You were completely right. I sleep so much better when I'm alone. And you scream in your sleep.
KRAMER I do?
KRAMER There was a man, he was trying to get into my apartment last night. He was jiggling the doorknob for twenty-five minutes.
EMILY C'mon, it was probably the wind.
KRAMER No, no, no. It was a fearless cat burglar. Now listen, you gotta let me sleep here, huh? Y'know, I'll stay here on my side, and I'll stuff a sock in my mouth. 'Cos I don't wanna sleep alone.
EMILY Well, I do.
JACK What took you so long?
JERRY I live in New York. What the hell happened?
JACK This thing is a, is a behemoth.
JERRY What did you do?
JACK I was, I was making a, a simple lane change. I, I put on the blinker and it took off on me. And the next thing you know, I was submerged. I'm telling you, Jerry, I'm very lucky that those crocs didn't get me.
JERRY You are such an idiot. Well, we gotta get the car cleaned up for my parents.
JACK Do whatever you want. It's your car.
JERRY My car? You drove it into the swamp!
JACK It drove itself into the swamp! Besides, I think I lost my pen, too.
JERRY You know, that almost makes this all worthwhile.
GEORGE Why is there a Cadillac parked in front of the house?
FRANK That's your mother's new car.
GEORGE You bought that?
FRANK It's a Coupe de Elegance.
ESTELLE Your father wanted a Mercedes, but I won't ride in a German car.
KRAMER Mornin'.
KRAMER Oh, boy.
GEORGE What the hell is going on here?
KRAMER I had some trouble at my place, so I need a little company at night to sleep.
ESTELLE George, your mother and I, and Kramer have been talking.
GEORGE Oh god.
KRAMER Uh, George, your parents can't blow through their savings in this community. It's low-rent. Now, we feel that Florida is really the place where they should be.
FRANK You can drop a grand in Disneyworld, like that.
GEORGE Wait a minute. You're thinking of moving to Florida again?!
ESTELLE Well, it's either that or we stay here, near you, and just sit on the money. What do you think we should do, Georgie?
PETERMAN So, anyway, effective immediately, Miss Benes will return to her old position, at her original salary...
PETERMAN ...and I, of course, will return to mine. Kudos, Elaine, on a job... done.
ELAINE What about my stock options?
PETERMAN I think not.
PETERMAN Now, down to business. I have had this vision of a diaphanous rum-runner scarf.
ELAINE Well, we could fly some fabric in from our silk factories, for about a thousand dollars a bolt.
MORTY A thousand?! I know a coupla Chinamen over there on Forty-third Street, who'll do it for half that.
ELAINE It's, ah, Asian-Americans.
MORTY What?
PETERMAN Who are you?
ELAINE Don't worry, I...
MORTY Morty Seinfeld. I cut velvet for forty years with Harry Altman.
ELAINE Okay, Mr Seinfeld, this is not the t...
PETERMAN Elaine, did you hire this man?
ELAINE No, no. Well, I mean, you know, he's more like an intern, you know, at best.
ELAINE So, if your parents move to Florida, you're poor.
GEORGE But happy.
ELAINE Obviously. And if they stay, you're rich, but...
GEORGE Obviously.
ELAINE Quite a dilemma. You know, I have a bit of a dilemma of my own.
GEORGE No, no. No, no, no. We're staying on me. We haven't solved anything yet.
ELAINE Alright, this is easy. Let 'em go.
GEORGE What d'you mean, let 'em go? They're spending all my money.
ELAINE Alright, well, then they stay. Lemma ask you something...
GEORGE Could you put a little thought into this? Jerry's gone, you could humour me. He humours me.
ELAINE Speaking of Jerry, his father is driving me so crazy down at Peterman's.
GEORGE You know what I do at the Yankees, when one of these old guys is breathing down my neck?
ELAINE What?
GEORGE You schedule a late meeting.
ELAINE Huh? What does that do?
GEORGE These old guys, they're up at 4 a.m., by two thirty they're wiped. How did we get back onto you?!
ELAINE I gotta split.
GEORGE You know, I got nothing outta this!
KRAMER Hey Frank, you got two beds in here.
FRANK That's right. That's me on the left.
KRAMER So, you sleep in separate beds.
FRANK Thirty years ago, we came to an agreement. It was the only way I could get some rest.
KRAMER Really?
FRANK Estelle's got the jimmy arms.
KRAMER You can get that in your arms?
FRANK Like you wouldn't believe. m.
JACK Jerry, it's getting late. You've cleaned up the car. You've made all your phone calls. Why are you still here?
JERRY Well, I uh, maxed out my credit cards, and I don't have enough cash for a hotel room. So...
JACK You are uh, thinking of staying here?
JERRY Well...
JACK You've got some nerve. I almost break my neck in that death-trap of yours, and now you ask me for a favour!
JERRY You didn't like that crack about the pen.
JACK I did not.
GEORGE Well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've gotta say...
GEORGE As much as I'd like to see the two of you living it up in a warm, tropical, setting, I, I would just miss you too much. So, I've decided, I want you to stay.
FRANK It's too late. We bought a condo at Del Boca Vista. We're leaving tonight.
GEORGE But you said it was my call.
ESTELLE We were just being nice.
ESTELLE Cosmo, are you sure you're gonna be alright here alone?
KRAMER Oh, yeah, yeah. I got Emily coming over tonight.
GEORGE You're letting him have a woman over?!
FRANK He's not family. It's different, psychologically.
PETERMAN And so, I made an explosive out of chick peas, and I stopped that great rhino right in his tracks.
MORTY Well, it's getting kinda late, why don't we uh...
ELAINE Mr Peterman, that can't have been the only time that you faced mortal danger.
PETERMAN Ha ha ha. Funny you should ask, Elaine.
MORTY Look, if we're gonna stay here until all hours of the night, can we at least get some food here?
PETERMAN It's only five fifteen. So, later on that same day, I developed a great hankering for some wild honey...
MORTY Okay, I'm done. I'll be back in the morning, when he's close to finish with his story.
PETERMAN Morty. My stories are what sell these clothes.
MORTY Cheap fabric, and dim lighting. That's how you move merchandise.
PETERMAN Morty, you're out.
MORTY Ach, I never knew what the hell I was peddling with those stupid cartoons and that paper book, anyway.
KRAMER I don't know why I let you talk me into that corned beef at Snitzer's.
EMILY No-one held a gun to your head.
KRAMER Yeah.
EMILY Don't forget, we're eating dinner at the Feinerman's tomorrow night.
KRAMER Oh, why do I have to go? They're your friends.
EMILY You like 'em.
KRAMER I've had it with 'em.
EMILY Then we won't go.
KRAMER Okay, okay. What time?
EMILY Eight thirty.
KRAMER Ahh. That was alright.
ELAINE 'One bright note in today's market, was the stock of retailer J Peterman, whose founder's surprise return generated a rise of twelve and a half points.'
JERRY Mmm-mmm-mmm. That means, if you still had those stock options...
ELAINE Yeah.
GEORGE That's a shame.
ELAINE What, are you sticking it to me?
GEORGE What?
ELAINE I think you're sticking it to me.
JERRY Elaine, I'm sure George is just being sympathetic.
ELAINE Stickin' it!
JERRY You're not alone. I'm practically broke.
ELAINE Really?
JERRY No. But, I did blow over twenty thousand on that Cadillac.
GEORGE Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. Delicious.
JERRY Well, you seem happy.
GEORGE I am. The folks are twelve hundred miles away. I'm basking in the buffer zone. 'Nother piece of pie here!
ELAINE So, were your parents shocked to see the Cadillac?
JERRY Actually, I haven't heard from 'em yet.
ELAINE Hmm.
MORTY When are we gonna tell Jerry?
HELEN I don't wanna worry him. We'll tell him next time we go up.
MORTY He thought he could buy back that Cadillac for us? He's not getting away with that.
HELEN Besides, that condo was too much house.
ESTELLE How many times can you check the car?
FRANK I saw a bum sleeping in a Cadillac the other day.
ESTELLE Why would someone break into a car to take a nap?
FRANK They don't nap. They make it their home. They urinate in there!
ESTELLE You're driving me crazy!
FRANK That's it, we're going back to Queens. Where's my hat?
ESTELLE Nooh!
JERRY My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. They didn't want to move to Floriday, but they're in their sixties, and that's the law. You know how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front of the old people's house with a golf cart, jump out, "Let's go Pop, white belt, white pants, white shoes, get in the back. Drop the snow shovel right there, drop it!" I am not much for the family gathering. You know, you sit there, and the conversation's so boring. It's so dull. And you start to fantasize. You know, you think, what if I just got up and jumped out that window? What would it be like? Just crashed right through the glass.. You know. Come back in, there's broken glass, everybody's all upset. "No, I'm alright. I was just a little bored, there. No, I'm fine. I came back. I wanted to hear a little about that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose. Let's pick it up right there."
HELEN You have so many nice jackets. I don't know why you had to bring this jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? What's wrong with that nice gray one? You have beautiful clothes. They sit in your closet. Morty, you can't wear - this!
MORTY Are you getting that?
HELEN I thought you were getting it.
MORTY Should I pick up?
HELEN You want me to get that?
MORTY I'll get it!
HELEN I'll get it!
HELEN Hello?.. Hello?
JERRY Would you make this thing lower! I can hear it on the street!
MORTY So, how'd you do?
JERRY We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! We'll be in the championship game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment of my life.
HELEN This is your greatest moment? A game?
JERRY Well, no. Sharon Besser, of course.
MORTY You know what my greatest moment was, don't you? 1946. I went to work for Harry Flemming and I came up with the idea for the beltless trench coat.
HELEN Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party?
JERRY Well, the man's an individualist. He worked for Harry Flemming. He knows what he's doing.
HELEN But it's their 50th anniversary.
MORTY You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today. They invited you again. I think you should go.
JERRY First of all, I made plans with Elaine.
HELEN So bring her.
JERRY I don't even know them. What is she, your second cousin? I mean, I've met them three times in my life.
MORTY I don't know her either. She makes me fly all the way from Floriday for this, and then she criticizes my jacket.
HELEN At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then you'll leave.
MORTY How come he gets to leave?
JERRY If I wind up sitting nest to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. He's always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess it's because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation.
MORTY And it's always about Jeffrey, right?
JERRY Hey, he talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department.
KRAMER Morty, are you coming in?
MORTY Oh, yeah. I forgot all about it.
KRAMER Hey, how'd you do?
JERRY We won. We're in the finals on Wednesday..
KRAMER Yeah!
JERRY What is this about?
KRAMER I'm completely changing the configuration of the apartment. You're not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle.
JERRY What are you doing?
KRAMER Levels.
JERRY Levels?
KRAMER Yeah, I'm getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And I'm going to build these different levels, with steps, and it'll all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You know, like ancient Egypt.
JERRY You drew up plans for this?
KRAMER No, no. It's all in my head.
MORTY I don't know how you're going to be comfortable like that.
KRAMER Oh, I'll be comfortable.
JERRY When do you intend to do this?
KRAMER Ohh.. should be done by the end of the month.
JERRY You're doing this yourself?
KRAMER It's a simple job. Why, you don't think I can?
JERRY Oh, no. It's not that I don't think you can. I know that you can't, and I'm positive that you won't.
KRAMER Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is the lumber.
MORTY Hey, that's some big job.
JERRY I don't see it happening.
KRAMER Well, this time, this time you're wrong. C'mon. I'll even bet you.
JERRY Seriously?
HELEN I dont' want you betting. Morty, don't let him bet.
KRAMER A big dinner with dessert. But I've got till the end of the month.
JERRY I'll give you a year.
KRAMER No, no, no. End of the month.
JERRY It's a bet.
JERRY Seriously, do you wnat to switch chairs?
ELAINE No, no. I'm fine.
LEO Jerry, are you listening to this?
JERRY Yeah, Uncle Leo.
LEO So, so, now the parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey for a citation.
JERRY Right. For reducing the pond scum?
LEO No, for the walking tours.
JERRY Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life - the edible foliage tour.
LEO That's exactly right. He knows the whole history of the park. For two hours he's talking and answering questions. But you want to know something? Whenever he has a problem with one of these high-powered big shots in the Parks Department, you know who he calls?
JERRY Mickey Mantle?
ELAINE Jerry, Jerry. Did you taste these peas? These peas are great!
JERRY These peas are bursting with country-fresh flavor.
ELAINE Mmm.. phenomenal peas..
MORTY Are you ready for dessert?
JERRY Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going.
MANYA You're going?
ELAINE I don't really eat dessert. I'm dieting.
JERRY Yeah, I can't eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I can't dance.
MANYA Can't dance?
HELEN He's kidding, Manya.
MANYA Is that a joke?
HELEN So, did you hear Claire's getting married?
MANYA Yeah, yeah..
HELEN I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know, trotters, like at Yonkers.
JERRY Horses. They're like big riding dogs.
ELAINE What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies..
JERRY I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.
MANYA ..I had a pony.
JERRY ..Well, I didn't really mean a pony, per se.
MANYA When I was a little girl in Poland, we all had ponies. My sister had pony, my cousin had pony, ..So, what's wrong with that?
JERRY Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressting..
HELEN Should we have coffee? Who's having coffee?
MANYA He was a beautiful pony! And I loved him.
JERRY Well, I'm sure you did. Who wouldn't love a pony? Who wouldn't love a person that had a pony?
MANYA You! You said so!
JERRY No, see, we didn't have ponies. I'm sure at the time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars..
MANYA That's it! I've had enough!
ISAAC Have your coffee, everyone. She's a little upset. It's been an emotional day.
JERRY I didn't know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrant's going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sitting on a pony. Why would anybody come hre if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? It doesn't make sense.. am I wrong?
JERRY I'll drive you to the airport.
HELEN No, we're taking a cab.
JERRY I just hope that whole pony incident didn't put a damper on the trip.
HELEN Don't be rediculous. It was a misunderstanding.
MORTY Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony.
JERRY Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her I'm sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible.
HELEN You know, you should give Manya a call.
JERRY Maybe I will.
KRAMER Oh, hi. I just came to say goodbye. ..Need any help with those?
MORTY It's nothing. I got it. So, how are your levels coming along?
KRAMER Oh, well.. I decided I'm not gonna do it.
JERRY Really? What a shock.
HELEN Goodbye, Jerry.
JERRY Take care.
HELEN We'll call you.
MORTY Bye, Jer.
JERRY Bye, Dad. Take it easy.
MORTY Bye, Mr. Kramer.
KRAMER Yeah. So long, Morty.
JERRY So, when do I get my dinner?
KRAMER There's no dinner. The bet's off. I'm not gonna do it.
JERRY Yes. I know you're not gonna do it. That's why I bet.
KRAMER There's not bet if I' not doing it.
JERRY That's the bet! That you're not doing it!
KRAMER Yeah, well, I could do it. I don't want to do it.
JERRY We didn't bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done.
KRAMER And it could be done.
JERRY Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! But it only is done if it's done. Show me the levels! The bet is the levels.
KRAMER But I don't want the levels!
JERRY That's the bet! Hello? ..No, oh, hi.. no, they just left.. Oh my God.. hand on a second. Maybe I can still catch them. Ma!.. Ma!.. Up here! Don't get in the cab! .. Manya died! ..Manya died!!
HELEN Who did you talk to?
JERRY Uncle Leo.
HELEN And when's the funeral?
JERRY I don't know. He said he'd call back.
MORTY You know what this means, don't you? We lost the supersaver. Those tickets are non-refundable.
HELEN She just had a check-up. The doctor said she was fine. Unless..
JERRY What?
HELEN What? Nothing.
JERRY You don't think.. What? The pony remark?
HELEN Oh, don't be ridiculous. She was an old woman.
JERRY You don't think that I killed her?
MORTY You know what the flight back'll cost us?
JERRY It was just an innocent comment! I didn't know she had a pony!
MORTY Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base in Sarasota, I think.
JERRY The whole thing ws taking out of context. It was a joke. That's probably Uncle Leo.
HELEN Hello? ..Yes, I know.. Well, it's just one of those things.. Sure, sure, we'll see you then. The funeral's Wednesday.
JERRY Wednesday? What, what Wednesday?
HELEN Two o' clock, Wednesday. What?
JERRY I've got the softball game on Wednesday. It's the championship.
HELEN So? You're not obligated. Go play in your game.
JERRY I didn't even know the woman.
HELEN So don't go.
JERRY I mean I met her three times. I don't know her last name.
HELEN Jery, no one's forcing you.
JERRY I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? That's what I want to know. I mean, it's the championship. I'm hitting everything.
HELEN I don't have a dress to wear. And you. You don't have anything.
MORTY I got a sport jacket.
HELEN You're not wearing that to a funeral.
MORTY What's wrong with it?
HELEN It looks ridiculous.
MORTY What? I'm gonna buy a new jacket now?
JERRY I don't know what to do.
MORTY ..You know what this funeral's gonna wind up costing me? Oh boy!
JERRY We don't understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you can't stretch out and get some solid rest at that point, I don't see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. No is he going to a meeting, or is he catching forty winks? I mean, let's make up our mind where we think they're going.
ELAINE I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. What time's your game?
JERRY Two Forty-Five.
ELAINE And what time's the funeral?
JERRY Two o' clock.
ELAINE How long does a funeral take?
JERRY Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, even Oswald took forty-five minutes.
ELAINE So you cna't do both?
JERRY You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldn't expect her to go to my funeral. I would understand.
ELAINE How can you even consider not going?
GEORGE You know, I've been thinking.. I cannot envision any circumstances in which I'll ever have the opportunity to have sex again. How's it gonna happen? I just don't see how it could occur.
ELAINE You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how I'm actually going to die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that.
GEORGE They always make me take stock of my life and how I've pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting it.
JERRY I know, and then you say to yourself, "From this moment on, I'm not going to waste any more of it." But then you go, "How? What can I do that's not wasting it?"
ELAINE Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Can't you hae coffee with people?
GEORGE You know, I can't believe you're even considering not playing. We need you. You're hitting everything.
ELAINE He has to go. He may have killed her.
JERRY Me? What about you? You brought up the pony.
ELAINE Oh, yeah, but I didn't say I hated anyone who had one.
GEORGE Who's going to play left field?
JERRY Bender.
GEORGE Bender? He can't play left. He stinks. I just don't see what purpose is it going to serve your going? I mean, you think dead peole care who's at the funeral? They don't even know they're having a funeral. It's not like she's hanging out in the back going, "I can't believe Jerry didn't show up."
ELAINE Maybe she's there in spirit. How about that?
GEORGE If you're a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think she's going to want to hang around Drexler's funeral home on Ocean Parkway?
ELAINE George, I met this woman! She is not traveling to any other dimensions.
GEORGE You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? It's not like getting on a bus. One second. It's all mental.
JERRY Fifty years they were married. Now he's moving to Pheonix.
ELAINE Phoenix? What's happening with his appartment?
JERRY I don't know. They've been in there since, like, World War II. The rent's three hundred a month.
ELAINE Three hundred a month? Oh my God.
MAN Although this may seem like a sad even, it should not be a day of mourning.. for Manya had a rich, fulfilling life. She grew up in a different world - a simpler world - with loving parents, a beautiful home in the country, and from what I understand, she eve had a pony.. Oh, how she loved that pony. Even in her declining years, whenever she would speak of it, her eyes would light up. It's lustrous coat, it's flowing mane. It was the pride of Krakow.
JERRY Well, the game's starting just about now.
HELEN It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture.
INTERN I'm not a doctor yet, Uncle Morty. I'm just an intern. I can't write a note to an airline.
MORTY You've got your degree. They don't care. They just want to see something.
JERRY I just wanted to say how sorry I was..
LEO Jerry, you wanna hear something? Your cousin, Jeffrey, is switching parks. They're transferring him to Riverside - so he'll completely revamp that operation, you understand? He'll do in Riverside what he did in Central Park. It's more money. So, that's your cousin.
MORTY You don't understand, I've never paid a full fare.
JERRY Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am abou tthe other night.
ELAINE Oh, me too.
ISAAC Oh no, no, no. She forgot all about that. She was much mor upset about the potato salad.
ELAINE So, I understand you're moving to Phoenix?
ISAAC Yeah, my brother lives there. I think Manya would've liked Phoenix.
ELAINE Mmm.. gorgeous, exquisite town. Who, what's happening with your apartment?
ISAAC Of course it's very hot there. I'l lhave to get an air conditioner.
ELAINE Oh, you can have mine. I'll ship it out ot you.. but what about that big apartment on West End Avenue?
ISAAC Although they say it's a dry heat.
ELAINE Dry, wet.. what's happening with your apartment?
ISAAC I don't even know if I should take my winter clothing.
ELAINE I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and I'll watch it for you and I'll live there and I'll make sure that nothing happens to it.
ISAAC Oh, the apartment. Jeffrey's taking the apartment.
ELAINE Oh, Jeffrey.
JERRY You know Jeffery?
ELAINE Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department.
HELEN It's raining.
JERRY It's raining? It's raining. The game will be postponed. We'll play tomarrow.
MORTY Believe me, I wouldn't bother you if the army hadn't closed that base in Sarasota. Here, scribble a little something here.
INTERN I can't. I'll get in trouble.
MORTY Oh, for God's sakes!
GEORGE Who gets picked off in softball? It's unheard of.
JERRY It's never happend to me before.
ELAINE I remember saying to myself, "Why is Jerry so far off the base?"
JERRY I'll have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.
GEORGE And they in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly?
JERRY I thought there were two outs.
ELAINE I couldn't believe it when I saw you running. I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.
JERRY It was the single worst moment of my life.
GEORGE What about Sharon Besser?
JERRY Oh, well, of course. 1973.
ELAINE Makes you wonder, though, doesn't it?
JERRY Wonder about what?
ELAINE You know.. the spirit world.
JERRY You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?
ELAINE I never saw anyone play like that.
JERRY But I went ot the funeral.
ELAINE Yeah, but that doesn't make up for killing her.
GEORGE Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day.
JERRY Don't you think she would've heard I was there?
GEORGE Not necessarily.
JERRY Who figures and immigrant's gonna have a pony?
JERRY What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do we have these animals, these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides the pony ride. Why ponies? What are we doing with them? I mean, police don't use them for, you know, crowd control. "Hey, uh, you wanna get back behind the barricades. Hey! Hey, little boy. Yeah, I'm talking to you. Behind the barricades!" So somebody, I assume, genetically engineered these ponies. Do you think they could make them any size? I mean, could they make them like the size of a quarter, if they wanted? That would be fun for Monopoly, though, wouldn't it? Just have a little pony and you put him on the, "Baltic, that's two down, go ahead. Hold it. Right ther, Baltic. yeah, that's it. Fine. Right there, hold it right there."
JERRY I love it when people are complimented on something they're wearing and they accept the compliment as if it was about them. "Nice tie." "Well, thank you. Thank you very much." The compliment is for the tie, it's not for you, but we take it. That's kind of the job of clothes; to get compliments for us, because it's very hard to get compliments based on your human qualities. Right? Let's face it, no matter how nice a person you are, nobody's gonna come say "Hey, nice person." It's much easier to be a bastard and just try and match the colours up.
ELAINE Oh, look at this!
JERRY Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid. Something on the wall catches Elaine's eye. It's an old-fashioned girl's bicycle, with high handlebars, a pink frame and a basket on the front.
ELAINE Oh, cool! Look at that!
JERRY Yeah, I'm right there with ya.
ELAINE That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little.
ELAINE What d'you think Jerry? Jerry?
JERRY Huh?
ELAINE What d'you think?
JERRY Oh yeah, be great for your paper route.
ELAINE I love it. I'm getting it.
ELAINE Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry.
CHRISTIE I think your friend needs some help over there.
JERRY You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be.
ELAINE Hey!
SUSAN A little baby girl?
KEN Doctor says it could be any day now.
GEORGE So, Carrie, you and Susan are cousins. So your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, right? So what does that make me?
CARRIE Doesn't make you anything.
GEORGE Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter.
SUSAN So, have you picked out a name yet?
CARRIE Well, we've narrowed it down to a few. We like Kimberley.
SUSAN Aww.
GEORGE Hu-ho, boy.
KEN You don't like Kimberley?
GEORGE Ech. What else you got?
KEN How about Joan?
GEORGE Aw c'mon, I'm eating here.
SUSAN George!
CARRIE Pamela?
GEORGE Pamela?! Awright, I tell you what. You look like nice people, I'm gonna help you out. You want a beautiful name? Soda.
KEN What?
GEORGE Soda. S-O-D-A. Soda.
CARRIE I don't know, it sounds a little strange.
GEORGE All names sound strange the first time you hear 'em. What, you Telling me people loved the name Blanche the first time they heard it?
KEN Yeah, but uh... Soda?
GEORGE Yeah, that's right. It's working.
CARRIE We'll put it on the list.
GEORGE I solve problems. That's just what I do.
KRAMER Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good.
JERRY You're really going to town with that turkey there.
KRAMER Oh yeah, I got a big appetite.
KRAMER Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh.
JERRY It's on the door.
KRAMER What, this yellow stuff? No, I said mustard, Jerry. Dijon.
KRAMER Ah, 's no good.
KRAMER No. That's bush league.
JERRY Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there? That's like half a pound of turkey!
KRAMER No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without Dijon.
JERRY Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your favourites on hand.
KRAMER Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. What, are you unhappy with our arrangement?
JERRY What arrangement?
KRAMER Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I Wanted from your fridge, and you could take whatever you want from mine.
JERRY Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there and I will.
KRAMER Oh, hey.
ELAINE Hey.
JERRY Hey. What's with your neck?
ELAINE Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall. By myself.
JERRY Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number.
ELAINE Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow.
JERRY Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it.
ELAINE Ach, maybe.
JERRY Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.
ELAINE I don't know.
JERRY Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned it...
ELAINE You know what, why don't you just shut the hell up?
JERRY Awright.
ELAINE God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike to the first person who could make this pain go away.
KRAMER Aw, you really hurting, huh?
ELAINE Oh, Kramer, it's just awful.
KRAMER Uh hmm. Well, your arterioles have constricted. .
KRAMER Alright, lean forward, relax.
ELAINE What? What?
KRAMER Encounter shiatsu.
ELAINE Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?
KRAMER Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the Healing power of the body's natural pressure points.
ELAINE Ah hah.
KRAMER He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.
ELAINE Wha...?
KRAMER He's a genius. Here we go...
KRAMER From pain, will come pleasure.
KRAMER Uh? Voila.
ELAINE Oh my god!
KRAMER Yeah.
ELAINE Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!
JERRY What's even more amazing is his formal training is in paediatrics.
KRAMER Awright, my work is done here.
ELAINE Oh man! Kramer, thank you!
KRAMER Yeah, you can send that bike over any time.
ELAINE What? What, what is he talking about?
JERRY I dunno. Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to anyone who fixes your neck.
ELAINE You really think he wants the bike?
JERRY Oh yeah.
ELAINE It took him like ten seconds!
JERRY Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months.
GEORGE I think they really went for that Soda.
SUSAN What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring you.
GEORGE Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda.
SUSAN I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda.
GEORGE Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A Real original. You wanna hear what it is? Huh, you ready?
SUSAN Yeah.
SUSAN What is that? Sign language?
GEORGE No, Seven.
SUSAN Seven Costanza? You're serious?
GEORGE Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...
GEORGE ...especially a girl. Or a boy.
SUSAN I don't think so.
GEORGE What, you don't like the name?
SUSAN It's not a name. It's a number.
GEORGE I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all-around beautiful name, it is also a living tribute.
SUSAN It's awful. I hate it!
GEORGE Well, that's the name!
SUSAN Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to be named Seven!
GEORGE Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all crazy on me!
JERRY Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of school, seven beatings a day. Roughly seven stitches a beating, and eventually seven years to life. Yeah, you're doing that child quite a service.
GEORGE Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name than Seven.
JERRY Awright, let's see. How about Mug? Mug Costanza, that's original. Or uh, Ketchup? Pretty name for a girl.
GEORGE Alright, you having a good time there?
JERRY I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? Pimento. Gherkin. Sauce. Maxwell House.
GEORGE Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me, Jerry. I had this name for a long time.
JERRY Oh, I forgot to call Christie.
GEORGE Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?
JERRY Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop neck. She looked like some kinda superhero.
GEORGE And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do it!
JERRY I'm not engaged.
KRAMER Ah, I got it.
JERRY Got what?
KRAMER Got the answer, Jerry. Refrigerator problem, is solved.
JERRY Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want.
KRAMER Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I want.
KRAMER Here. I write it down. "One cupcake." And then I put it in the bowl. There. Very simple.
JERRY Sort of a mooching inventory.
KRAMER No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em all up, and you give me the bill.
JERRY Alright.
KRAMER Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When Elaine comes by with that bike, you hang onto it for me, alright?
JERRY Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike.
KRAMER Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other at our word, all is lost.
KRAMER Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab.
JERRY Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the best in the city. MAITRE D' May I take your coat, miss?
CHRISTIE Yes, thank you.
GEORGE The same outfit?
JERRY The exact same outfit.
GEORGE How many days was it between encounters.
JERRY Three.
GEORGE Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new wash cycle. You know, she did laundry the day after she met you, everything got clean and she started all over again.
JERRY Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at the end of the cycle?
GEORGE Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.
JERRY Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?
GEORGE Very curious.
JERRY Indeed.
GEORGE You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day.
JERRY Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide.
GEORGE Awright, I'm heading home.
JERRY Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?
GEORGE Not yet, but she's weakening.
JERRY You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't Destroy someone else's.
GEORGE It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry. My idol.
JERRY How about 'Mickey'?
GEORGE 'Mickey'? 'Mickey'!
KRAMER Hey buddy.
JERRY Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the fridge?
KRAMER No, that's yours. My half is gone.
JERRY What?
KRAMER Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your beef?
JERRY You cannot buy half a can of soda.
KRAMER Well, why not.
JERRY Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation with you here, but you know the sound a can makes when you open it?
KRAMER Yeah.
JERRY That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes for this, okay...
JERRY ...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought the whole fruit. Not a third of an apple, not a half of a banana...
KRAMER Alright.
JERRY ...You bite it, you bought it.
KRAMER Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright.
JERRY Thank you.
KRAMER Yeah.
ELAINE Hey.
KRAMER Oh. So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?
ELAINE Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even know why you ant it. I mean, it's a girl's bike.
KRAMER It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.
ELAINE No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like saying, you're hungry enough to eat a horse.
KRAMER Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He gets it from his butcher.
ELAINE This is not the point. The point is, you just can't have the bike.
KRAMER Boy, I am really surprised at you. You are the last person I figured would do something like this. I mean, George, yeah, I can see that. Even Jerry. But not you, Elaine...
KRAMER I always put you up here...
KRAMER ...They're over here. Now you're... aww-whawww.
ELAINE Alright.
KRAMER Digidi.
GEORGE Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody else is gonna have it and I absolutely love it.
SUSAN Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more.
GEORGE Why not?
SUSAN Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told them the name, they just loved it.
GEORGE So, what're you saying?
SUSAN They're gonna name their baby Seven.
GEORGE What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name, I made it up!
SUSAN I can't believe that they're using it.
GEORGE Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose all its cachet!
SUSAN I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with.
GEORGE Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the yin-yang!
ELAINE Oh god! Oh, god. Kramer!
MAN Watch your step. Elaine collides with a litter bin which is outside her field of vision.
ELAINE Oh, ah. Stupid Kramer.
CHRISTIE Excuse me. Elaine?
ELAINE Huh?
CHRISTIE Over here. I thought that was you. You're Jerry's friend, right?
ELAINE Yeah, yeah. Uh, Christie?
CHRISTIE Yes. How y'doing?
ELAINE I'm fine.
CHRISTIE Well, I gotta run. It was good to see you.
ELAINE Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you.
VOICE_1 Lookin' good.
VOICE_2 Hey Cosmo, nice wheels.
KRAMER You got that right!
KID Hey, you're riding a girl's bike.
ELAINE Kramer! Kramer!
KEN Hello.
GEORGE Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk.
ELAINE Kramer!
ELAINE Kramer!!
JERRY Hey
ELAINE Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?
JERRY Haven't seen him. How's the neck?
ELAINE His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was before.
JERRY Boy, I'm surprised. I would think Kramer would have a knack for moving pieces of a person's spine around.
ELAINE Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the antique store. What's her name, Christie?
JERRY You saw her? What was she wearing?
ELAINE I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of my neck.
JERRY Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression?
ELAINE What d'you care?
JERRY Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
ELAINE Did you have a nice ride?
KRAMER Oh, great ride.
ELAINE Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!
KRAMER What're you talking about?! We had a deal!
ELAINE You better give me back that bike! Look at this! Look! Ow. I couldn't even crawl out of bed this morning.
KRAMER Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a week.
ELAINE What? You never told me that.
KRAMER Well, it's common sense.
ELAINE Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous.
KRAMER Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should settle this.
ELAINE Yeah Jerry.
JERRY Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but unfortunately, my friendship to each of you precludes my getting involved. What you need is an impartial mediator.
ELAINE Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?
KRAMER Alright, I'm down.
JERRY Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story before. Someone who is unencumbered by any emotional attachment. Someone whose heart is so dark, it cannot be swayed by pity, compassion, or human emotion of any kind.
ELAINE So, that's the situation.
NEWMAN Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly has a legitimate claim to the bicycle, and yet the bicycle can have only one rightful owner. Quite the conundrum. As a federal employee, I believe the law is all we have. It's all that separates us from the savages who don't deserve even the privilege of the daily mail. Stuffing parcels into mailboxes where they don't belong!!...
KRAMER Newman!
NEWMAN ...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, no Matter how unjust it may seem to either of you. Do I have your word?
KRAMER Uh, yeah.
ELAINE Yeah.
NEWMAN Alright, let's begin.
NEWMAN Ooh, my cocoa!
KEN Why can't we use Seven?
GEORGE It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it.
CARRIE Well, it's not as if Susan's pregnant. You've already postponed The wedding. Who knows if you'll ever get married.
GEORGE Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't waffle!
KEN Right, we're both big Mickey Mantle fans, and we love the name. It's very unusual.
GEORGE What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on Soda.
KEN Well, we don't care for Soda.
GEORGE You don't care for Soda?!
CARRIE No, no. We don't like Soda at all!
GEORGE How d'you not like Soda?! It's bubbly, it's refreshing!
CARRIE Oh!
KEN What is it?
CARRIE I felt something.
KEN Are you okay, honey?
CARRIE I think I'm going into labour.
KEN Oh god, oh god. Okay, let's not panic. Let's just get to the hospital...
CARRIE Okay.
KEN ...Alright? I got the suitcase packed, right here.
GEORGE What about Six?
GEORGE Nine. Thirt... thirteen's no good.
GEORGE Fourteen. Fourteen!
CHRISTIE Are you okay, Jerry? You seem quiet.
JERRY No, I'm just a little uh, worn out.
CHRISTIE I know exactly what you mean.
JERRY Oh, I'm sure you do.
JERRY What in god's name is going on here? Is she wearing the same thing over and over again? Or does she have a closet full of these, like Superman? I've got to unlock this mystery.
CHRISTIE Oh my god!
JERRY Oh.
CHRISTIE Ahh. I can't go to the movies like this. Do you mind if we go back to my apartment, so I can change?
JERRY Change? Yes, I think that's a super idea.
CARRIE Are we almost there?
KEN Just keep breathing, okay.
CARRIE Okay, okay.
KEN Okay.
GEORGE You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow Mantle that I would name my baby Seven.
KEN Now's not the best time, George!
GEORGE It's just that, I know her, and boy...
KEN George! She's in labour!
GEORGE So am I!
NEWMAN Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the one hand, Elaine, your promise was given in haste. But was it not still a promise? Hmm?
NEWMAN And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for compensation. But, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer to some assurance Of reliability? Hmm? Huh? Ahh. These were not easy questions to answer. Not for any man...
NEWMAN ...But I have made a decision. We will cut the bike down the middle, and give half to each of you.
ELAINE What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!
ELAINE Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. Cut the stupid thing in half.
KRAMER No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another than see it destroyed. Newman, give it to her, I beg you.
ELAINE Yeah, yeah, y-yeah.
NEWMAN Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather give it away than see it come to harm. Kramer, the bike is yours!
ELAINE What?!
KRAMER Sweet justice. Newman, you are wise.
ELAINE But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still hurting me, and now you have the bike?!
KRAMER Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride.
CHRISTIE Here we are.
JERRY Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude.
CHRISTIE Well, I guess I'll go change.
JERRY Yes, change. By all means, change.
JERRY August seventeen, nineteen-ninety-two. The same dress! She never changes! Oh my god. She's gotta have hundreds of these dresses.
JERRY There must be a secret stash around here somewhere.
CHRISTIE Ahem! Are you looking for something?
JERRY What're you doing? I thought you were changing.
CHRISTIE No, I, I'm thinking we should just call it a night.
JERRY No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out.
CHRISTIE If it's all the same to you, I think I'm just gonna go to bed.
JERRY You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on The couch. Then in the morning, you'll get dressed, we'll walk out together. Both dressed, different clothes. Well, I'll be in the same clothes. You'll of course be in different clothes, because it's your apartment. But we'll go downstairs, me in my same clothes, you in your different clothes.
CHRISTIE Jerry. I don't think so.
JERRY You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?
CHRISTIE Get out.
JERRY Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you lay it out on the bed.
KEN Okay, breathe, honey. Breathe.
GEORGE You know, you're really being very selfish. It would be nice if you would think of someone other than yourself every now and then!
CARRIE I'm having a baby!!
KEN George, you're not getting Seven! Now get outta here!!
GEORGE Please! I have so little!
ORDERLY Sorry sir, it's family only.
GEORGE I'm family. I'm having sex with the cousin!
GEORGE Seven!!
JERRY Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again? Oh really? Well you can't break up with me over the phone. C'mon, you gotta do this in person. It doesn't even have to be one on one, you can bring a group of friends. I just wanna see you. Wait, don't hang up on me. Why d'you wear the same dress all the time? Hello.
KRAMER Hey, Jerry, if you're gonna be snacking On these, you can't expect me to pay for the whole box.
JERRY Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little Smorgasbord here, but it's the end of the week, so I added up your tab.
KRAMER Yikes.
JERRY I know. Pretty steep.
KRAMER Well, I don't have this kind of cash.
JERRY Few do.
KRAMER I'm good for it.
JERRY Yeah, well, until this bill is paid...
JERRY ...the food court is closed.
KRAMER Alright. I'll get that money for you in five minutes. And, don't eat any more.
ELAINE Hey, that's my bike!
NEWMAN Gangway!
ELAINE This is my bike!
NEWMAN Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from Kramer. He was hard up for cash. Fifty bucks! Can you believe it? Of course, I had to make some minor modifications, you know. Solid tyres, reinforced seatpost, heavy duty shocks. But, baby, this is one sweet ride.
ELAINE No, you better gimme back that bike. Newman, gimme...
NEWMAN Hey!! Help me!
JERRY I love it when people are complimented on something they're wearing and they accept the compliment as if it was about them. "Nice tie." "Well, thank you. Thank you very much." The compliment is for the tie, it's not for you, but we take it. That's kind of the job of clothes; to get compliments for us, because it's very hard to get compliments based on your human qualities. Right? Let's face it, no matter how nice a person you are, nobody's gonna come Say "Hey, nice person." It's much easier to be a bastard and just try and match the colours up.
JERRY All right. How 'bout this one: let's say you're abducted by aliens.
GEORGE Fine.
JERRY They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now: would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?
GEORGE I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.
JERRY But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!
GEORGE I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..
JERRY At least it's show business..
GEORGE But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.
JERRY What if she's got no interest in you?
GEORGE W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.
KRAMER George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?
GEORGE Krama, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!
KRAMER Wha??
JERRY He knows.
GEORGE {Anyway,} on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! Ha ha!
KRAMER Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.
GEORGE You sure?
JERRY He knows.
GEORGE Wow. Nice.
JERRY Why don't you try your engagement story?
GEORGE Won't work.
JERRY Are you sure?
GEORGE He knows.
ELAINE Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends.
KEVIN Friends?
ELAINE Well. I mean. Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.
KEVIN Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!
MAN Damn thing is jammed again..
KRAMER You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em.
MAN_2 Hey Leland wants everyone in the conference room right now.
MAN Come on, let's go.
KRAMER Oh, yeah--yeah..
ELAINE Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.
JERRY I don't know, do you have a--
JERRY Not bad. Wuh--what does she--
ELAINE I put her stats on the back.
JERRY Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president: James Polk!"
GEORGE Hnn! Let me see that.
JERRY So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel-toe his ass back to Kentucky?
ELAINE You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.
JERRY Why would anybody want a friend.
ELAINE Uh. It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.
JERRY I mean all that stuff is so small.. stupid..
GEORGE You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiance..
JERRY What?
GEORGE Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been inside in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!
ELAINE Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city.
GEORGE Can I keep this?
ELAINE No, I need it.
GEORGE Thanks.
GEORGE Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..
AMANDA I'm sorry sir, there is no Mr. Vandelay here..
GEORGE Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh!
AMANDA Oh! She's beautiful! Who is she?
GEORGE Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiance, Susan. May she rest in peace.
AMANDA Oh, sorry.. She was lovely. I'm Amanda.
GEORGE I'm George.
MAN_3 Good work today, K-man!
KRAMER Well, you know what they say, you don't sell the steak, you sell the sizzle.
MAN_3 Heh, heh!
KRAMER You want a drink? I'm buyin'
MAN_3 In that case, make mine a double!
GILLIAN Jerry?
JERRY Gillian. Hiii..
GILLIAN Very nice to meet you.
JERRY It's nice to meet you!
JERRY She had man-hands.
ELAINE Man, Hands?
JERRY The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.
ELAINE {Look,} would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?
JERRY Would she have hooks?
ELAINE Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?
JERRY Kinda cool lookin'..
ELAINE Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my {place tomorrow}--
JERRY Yeah. Yeah.
ELAINE Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of {buttons}.
JERRY Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--
ELAINE Jerry!
JERRY Kramer?!
KRAMER Hey buddy! Hey!
JERRY It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!
KRAMER Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.
JERRY Why??
KRAMER Because I'm workin' there, that's why.
JERRY How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?
KRAMER Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?
JERRY Now that you mention it.
KRAMER But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.
JERRY How much are they payin' you?
KRAMER Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay. I'm doin' this just for me.
JERRY Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?
KRAMER tcb. You know, takin' care o' business. Aa--I gotta go.
JERRY All right.
KRAMER I'll see you tonight, huh? Forget my briefcase.
JERRY W-w-wha' you got in there?
KRAMER Crackers.
JERRY So the picture worked. Amazing!
GEORGE Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?
JERRY I don't know, but you don't have it.
GEORGE Right. Bye.
ELAINE Where were you today?
JERRY What?
ELAINE Pick. Up.
JERRY Damn.
ELAINE So? Where were you?!
JERRY Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.
ELAINE I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!
JERRY So? What are friends for?
ELAINE Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.
JERRY So he's Bizarro Jerry!
ELAINE Bizarro Jerry?
JERRY Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.
ELAINE Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?
JERRY No. It's still a goodbye.
ELAINE Uh. Does he live underwater?
JERRY No.
ELAINE Is he black..
JERRY Look. Just, forget it, {already}. All right?
KRAMER Wow. Man. What a day. Could I use a drink.
JERRY Tough day at the office?
KRAMER Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.
JERRY Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.
KRAMER Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast..
GEORGE This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!
MODEL_1 Hey! Amanda!
AMANDA These are my friends. Anabelle, Justina, and Nikki. We used to model together.
GEORGE Oh! Modelling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
AMANDA So Nikki, uh, how was Paris this time?
MODEL_2 A bore.
GEORGE You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fianc�e, Susan.. In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her..
MODEL_3 Wow.. She was beautiful.. Do you wanna dance?
GILLIAN Would you like some bread, Jerry?
JERRY No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.
GILLIAN Well, then at least drink your beer..
JERRY Oh. Twist off..
GILLIAN You have a little something on your face.
JERRY I can get it.
GILLIAN Eh, no-no, No-no.. You're missing it, it's higher.
GILLIAN It's an eyelash. Make a wish.
JERRY I don't want to.
GILLIAN Make a wish.
JERRY Okay. Didn't come true.
GILLIAN Don't you just love lobster?
KEVIN That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.
ELAINE I know, he's so tiny!
KEVIN Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call "Feldman!"
ELAINE Bizarro world..

JERRY Then it does exist.
GEORGE Yes. The legends are true.
JERRY So when are you goin' out with this girl again?
GEORGE I'm not! I'm inside the walls!
JERRY So you're gonna burn that bridge.
GEORGE Flame on!
GENE I got it.
KEVIN No. You got it last time.
GENE Don't worry about it.
ELAINE This is unbelievable..
FELDMAN Hey Elaine, what do you think of an alarm clock, that automatically tells you the weather when you wake up?
ELAINE Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!
FELDMAN Nah, it's not--it's just not practical.
KEVIN Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library.
ELAINE What are you gonna do down there?
KEVIN Read!
ELAINE Hello?
JERRY So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.
KRAMER Uh-huh.
JERRY Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George the Animal, {steer}.
KRAMER Yeah..
JERRY Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.
KRAMER That's nice..
JERRY Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!
KRAMER Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?--
JERRY I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--
KRAMER Oh here we go--
JERRY An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!
KRAMER What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!
JERRY It's your third day..
KRAMER I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later.
JERRY Well. Call if you're gonna be late!
ELAINE What? What is goin' on with you two?
JERRY Oh, I don't wanna talk about it..
ELAINE All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later.
JERRY Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.
ELAINE Well, I. I guess I been at Reggie's..
JERRY The Bizarro coffeeshop?
ELAINE Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..
JERRY I read.
ELAINE Books, Jerry.
JERRY Oh. Big deal..
ELAINE Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..
JERRY {What's goin' on,} like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--
ELAINE I'll see you later man. I gotta go.
JERRY The whole system is breakin' down!
GEORGE Hello? Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends. Yeah. Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now. Bye-bye. No! No!
GILLIAN Friends. Just friends.
JERRY Yeah.
GILLIAN Yeah. All right. Well, do you still want to see a movie later?
JERRY I wish I could, but, we're friends..
GILLIAN I'm just gonna go, wash my hands.
JERRY Good idea. There's a beach towel on the rack.. Yeah.

JERRY Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, was, for two.
KRAMER You cooked?
JERRY I ordered in. It's still effort.
KRAMER Ow! Jeez!
JERRY What's wrong?
KRAMER {Ow!} It's my stomach.
JERRY You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.
KRAMER You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.

KEVIN {Here ya are.}
ELAINE Guys. I gotta go. Take it easy.
GEORGE Elaine? Can I come?
ELAINE I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..
KRAMER What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?

KRAMER Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..
LELAND No, no, I don't think that's going to, do it, uh. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all.. I don't know what this is supposed to be!
KRAMER Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead..
LELAND Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on.
KRAMER I don't even really work here!
LELAND That's what makes this so difficult.
GEORGE Hi. George.
MODEL_4 Are you sure you're supposed to be here?
GEORGE Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiance, back when it was a meat-packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture.
MODEL_4 What'd you do? Cut this out of a magazine or something?
GEORGE Huh?
MODEL_5 That's me? It's from a Clinique ad I did..
GEORGE Ha! Heh.
BOUNCER Let's go. Private party.
KEVIN Who is it?
ELAINE It's Lainey!

ELAINE Hi {?}. Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh!
KEVIN Come on in!
ELAINE Okay. Hi Gene! Uh-ha!
ELAINE What's up?
KEVIN Just reading..
KEVIN Hey.. What're you doing?
ELAINE Eatin' olives.
KEVIN Have you ever heard of asking? Who is it?
FELDMAN Feldman.. From across the hall.
KEVIN Hold on. Hey.
FELDMAN He-ey, Kevin!
KEVIN Hi.
FELDMAN Look who I ran into.
VARGUS Hello, Kevin..
KEVIN Hello, Vargus..
KEVIN Ya wanna catch a ballgame this weekend?
VARGUS Great! I'll see ya later!
KEVIN Okay. Vargus.. {So?}
FELDMAN I got 'em..
KEVIN All right! Hey, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!
ELAINE Oh!
KEVIN Fourth row, center.
ELAINE Get out!
GENE What is the matter with you?
ELAINE Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?
GENE Haven't you done enough already?
ELAINE It's locked..
JERRY So this is it, huh?
GEORGE But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..
JERRY I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw? Get out of here George.
GENE At work today, I discovered there's a payphone in the lobby that has free long distance.
KEVIN Oh, so what did you do?
GENE I called the phone company an' immediately reported the error.
KEVIN Nice. Who is it?
FELDMAN Feldman.. From across the hall.
KEVIN Hold on.
FELDMAN Kevin! Brought some groceries.
KEVIN Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!
FELDMAN Hey, what are friends for?
KEVIN You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.
KEVIN Oh. Me so happy. Me want to cry.
JERRY You know, why we're here? To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about "We should go out"? This is what they're talking about...this whole thing, we're all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, we're all out! There are people tryin' to find us, they don't know where we are. "Did you ring?, I can't find him." "Where did he go?" "He didn't tell me where he was going". He must have gone out. You wanna go out: you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...There you're staring around, whatta you do? You go: "We gotta be getting back". Once you're out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, it's my feeling, you've gotta go.
JERRY Seems to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it: it's too high! It's in no-man's-land, you look like you live with your mother.
GEORGE Are you through?
JERRY You do of course try on, when you buy?
GEORGE Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I don't actually recall considering the buttons.
JERRY Oh, you don't recall?
GEORGE Uh, no, not at this time.
JERRY Well, senator, I just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it.
WAITRESS Mister Seinfeld. Mister Costanza.
GEORGE Are, are you sure this is decaf? Where's the orange indicator?
WAITRESS It's missing, I have to do it in my head: decaf left, regular right, decaf left, regular right...it's very challenging work.
JERRY Can you relax, it's a cup of coffee, Claire is a professional waitress.
WAITRESS Trust me George: no one has any interest in seeing you on caffeine.
GEORGE How come you're not doin' the second show tomorrow?
JERRY Well, there's this uh, woman might be comin' in.
GEORGE Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?
JERRY I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?
GEORGE No, you didn't!
JERRY I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing... There's no milk in here, what...
GEORGE Wait wait wait, what is she, what is she like?
JERRY Oh, she's really great. I mean, she's got like a real warmth about her and she's really bright and really pretty and uh...the conversation though, I mean, it was...talking with her is like talking with you, but, ya know, obviously much better.
GEORGE So, ya know, what, what happened?
JERRY Oh, nothing happened, ya know, but it was great.
GEORGE Oh, nothing happened, but it was...
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE This is great!
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE So, ya know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!
JERRY Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe we'll get together.
GEORGE Ho ho ho, "Had to"? "Had to come in"?
JERRY Yeah, but...
GEORGE "Had to come in" and "maybe we'll get together"? "Had to" and "Maybe"?
JERRY Yeah!
GEORGE No...no...no, I hate to tell you this: you're not gonna see this woman.
JERRY What, are you serious...why, why did she call?
GEORGE How do I know, maybe, ya know, maybe she wanted to be polite.
JERRY To be polite? You are insane!
GEORGE All right, all right, I didn't want to tell you this, you wanna know why she called you?
JERRY Yes!
GEORGE You're a back-up, you're a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan of contingency!
JERRY Oh, I get it, this is about the button.
GEORGE passes the table; George stops her and writes something on his note-block Claire, Claire, you're a woman, right?
CLAIRE What gave it away, George?
GEORGE Uhm...I'd like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, ya know, from a female point of view.
JERRY Oh, come on now, what are you asking her? Now, how is she gonna know?
GEORGE Now, a woman calls me, all right? She says she has to come to New York on business...
JERRY Oh you are beautiful!
GEORGE and, and maybe she'll see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?
CLAIRE I'd have to say: uuhh, no.
GEORGE So why did she call?
CLAIRE To be polite.
GEORGE To be polite, I rest my case.
JERRY Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what you're talking about, now, come on, come with me , I, I gotta go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway.
GEORGE I'm not gonna watch you do laundry.
JERRY Oh, come on, be a "come-with-guy".
GEORGE Come on, I'm tired.
CLAIRE Don't worry, I gave him a little caffeine: he'll perk up.
GEORGE Right, I knew I felt something...!
GEORGE Jerry? I have to tell ya somethin':...this is the dullest moment I've ever experienced.
JERRY Well, look at this guy! Look, he's got everything, he's got: detergents, sprays, fabric softeners; this is not his first load.
GEORGE I need a break, Jerry, ya know, I gotta get out of the city, I feel so cramped...
JERRY And you didn't even hear how she sounded.
GEORGE What?!
JERRY Laura.
GEORGE I can't believe: WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!
JERRY Yeah, but how could you be so sure?
GEORGE 'Cause it's signals, Jerry , it's signals! Don't you....all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin' tomorrow night, if you were busy?
JERRY No.
GEORGE She calls you today and she doesn't make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? It's Saturday night!
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE What is that? It's ridiculous! You don't even know, what hotel she's staying at, you can't call her. That's a signal, Jerry, that's a signal! Signal!
JERRY Maybe you're right.
GEORGE Maybe I'm right? Of course I'm right.
JERRY This is insane. You know, I don't even know where she's staying! She, she's not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.
GEORGE I know, I know. Listen, your stuff has to be done by know, why don't you just see if it's dried?
JERRY No no no, don't interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what it's doing, just let it finish.
GEORGE You're gonna "overdry" it.
JERRY You, you can't "overdry".
GEORGE Why not?
JERRY Same as you can't "overwet". You see, once something is wet, it's wet. Same thing with dead: like once you die you're dead, right? Let's say you drop dead and I shoot you: you're not gonna die again, you're already dead. You can't "overdie", you can't "overdry".
GEORGE Any questions?
JERRY How could she not tell me where she was staying?
GEORGE Look at that: they're done! It's a miracle!
JERRY "Laundry-day" is the only exciting day in the live of clothes. It is...no, think about it: the washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. Ya know, it's dark, there's bubbles happening, they're all kind a dancing around in there...shirt grabs the underwear: "C'mon babe, let's gather". You come by, you open up the lid and they'll: ...Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, they're in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers...the dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper, the night before: "Tomorrow, the dryer, I'm goin'...you wait here!" The dryer-door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. They hope you don't see him and then he goes down the road . They got buttons sewed on their faces: join the puppet show...So they're showing me on television the detergent for getting out blood-stains...Is this a violent image to anybody? Blood-stains? I mean, I, come on, you got a T-shirt with blood-stains all over it, maybe laundry isn't your biggest problem right now...Maybe you oughta get the harpoon out your chest first.
JERRY If you know what happened in the Mets-game, don't say anything, I taped it, hello... Yeah, no, I'm sorry, you have the wrong number...Yeah, no Yeah?
KRAMER Are you up?
JERRY Yeah... Yeah, people do move! Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem .
KRAMER Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh?
JERRY Ooohhhh, what are you doing? Kramer, it's a tape! I taped the game, it's one o'clock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this.
KRAMER Hey, I'm sorry, I...ya know, I, I thought you knew... You got any meat?
JERRY Meat? I don't, I don't know, go...hunt! Well what, what happened in the game anyway?
KRAMER What happened? Well, they STUNK, that's what happened! Ya know, I almost wound up going to that game.
JERRY Yeah you almost went to the game. You haven't been out of the building in ten years!
KRAMER Yeah. Are you done with this?
JERRY No.
KRAMER When you're done, let me know.
JERRY Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow.
KRAMER I thought I wasn't allowed to be in here this weekend.
JERRY No, it's OK now, that, that girl is not comin' uh, I, I misread the whole thing.
KRAMER You want me to talk to her?
JERRY I don't think so.
KRAMER Oh, I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost... a lawyer.
JERRY That close, huh?
KRAMER You better believe it.
JERRY Hello...Oh, hi, Laura.
KRAMER Give me it...let me talk to her .
JERRY No believe me, I'm always up at this hour. How are you?...great...sure...What time does the plane get in?...I got my friend George to take me......
KRAMER A SLIDE!...Wow!
JERRY ...No, it's, it's just my neighbour...uhm...yeah, I got it ten-fifteen...No, don't be silly, go ahead and ask...Yeah, sure...OK, great, no no, it's no trouble at all...I'll see you tomorrow...great, bye. I, I don't believe it...That, that was her. She wants to stay here!
JERRY If my father was moving this he'd had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. Have you got your end?...Your end's got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your end's got to come down.
GEORGE Ya know, I can't believe you're bringin' in an extra bed for woman, that wants to sleep with you. Why don't you bring in an extra guy too?
JERRY Look, it's a very awkward situation, I, I don't wanna be presumptuous.
GEORGE All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the EXACT phrasing of the request?
JERRY All right, she said she couldn't find a decent hotel- room...
GEORGE A decent hotel-room...
JERRY Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.
GEORGE You can't be serious. This is New York city: there must be eleven million decent hotel-rooms! Whatta ya need? A flag? This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!
JERRY This is the signal. Thank you, mister Signal, where were you yesterday?
GEORGE I think I was affected by the caffeine.
KRAMER He really likes you, George.
GEORGE Well, that's flattering.
KRAMER Oh, he's getting' a drink of water. Is this for that girl?
JERRY Yeah.
KRAMER Why even give her an option?
JERRY This is a person I like, it's not: "How to score on spring break".
GEORGE Right, can we go? 'Cause I'm double-parked, I'm gonna get a ticket.
JERRY Yeah, OK. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I, I forgot to clean the bathroom.
GEORGE So what? That's good.
JERRY Now, how could that be good?
GEORGE Because filth is good...Whatta you think: rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin' around the bathroom? They, they have a woman comin' over: "I've gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.
JERRY This is how you operate?
GEORGE Yeah, I wish.
JERRY Let me just wipe the sink.
KRAMER WHY EVEN GIVE HER AN OPTION FOR? It's unbelievable.
GEORGE Yeah.
KRAMER ...How's the real estate-business?
GEORGE ... It's uh, not bad, it's comin' along...Why? Did you need something.
KRAMER Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?
GEORGE Well, I might be getting in to that.
KRAMER You keep me posted!
GEORGE I'm aware of you, all right, let's go , let's go! You're on stage in 25 minutes.
JERRY The dating world is not a fun world...it's a pressure world, it's a world of tension, it's a world of pain...and ya know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, 'cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I don't know what they need. I know I don't have it, I know that...Ya know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one I'm, always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, we're all human beings, what is the story? I've never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, I've never been in a situation, when I thought to myself: "I could use a cotton-ball right now"...I can certainly get out of this mess...Women need them and they don't need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, they're like peat-moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? They're huge and two days later, they're out, they're gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin' with them? The only time I ever see'em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, there's two or three, that look like they've been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I don't know what happened to them...I once went out with a girl who's left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over my house. I don't know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town: "Let's move on"... The dating world is a world of pressure. Let's face it: a date is a job-interview, that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job-interview is: not many job-interviews is there a chance you'll end up naked at the end of it...ya know: "Well, Bill, the boss thinks you're the man for the position, why don't you strip down and meet some of the people you'll be workin' with?".
JERRY Wouldn't it be great if you could ask a woman what she's thinking?
GEORGE What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what she's thinkin'.
JERRY Ya know, instead, I'm like a detective: I've gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.
GEORGE Listen, listen, don't get worked up, 'cause you're gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.
JERRY Really? How?
GEORGE 'Cause it's all in the greeting.
JERRY Uh-huh.
GEORGE All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, that's a good sign.
JERRY Right.
GEORGE Ya know, anything in the, in the "lip-area" is good.
JERRY "Lip-area".
GEORGE Ya know a hug: definitely good.
JERRY Hug is definitely good.
GEORGE Sure.
JERRY Although what if it's one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?
GEORGE That's so brutal, I hate that.
JERRY Ya know how they do that?
GEORGE That's why, ya know, a shake is bad.
JERRY Shake is bad, but what if it's the "two-hander"? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?
GEORGE Hand-sandwich.
JERRY Right.
GEORGE I see, well, that's open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes...
LAURA Guess who?
JERRY Hey, hey.
LAURA_AND_JERRY Heeeey!
JERRY It's good to see you.
LAURA Hi.
JERRY This is my friend George.
LAURA Hi, how nice to meet you.
GEORGE Hi, how are you?
JERRY This is Laura.
GEORGE Laura, sure.
JERRY I can't believe you're here.
GEORGE_AND_JERRY Ooh yeah, the bags, sure.
LAURA Oh, thank you.
JERRY Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?
GEORGE Yes, the "surprise-blindfold-greeting". That wasn't in the manual, I don't know.
JERRY So uh, what do ya think?
LAURA Ooohhh, wow! This place isn't so bad.
JERRY Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road...So uh, make yourself at home. So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?
LAURA Actually uhm, do you have any wine? JERRY; Uh, yeah, I think I do.
LAURA Oh, do, do you mind if I turn this down?
JERRY Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead.
LAURA Uh, Jerry, uh, I was wondering: would it be possible, and if it's not, fine, for me to stay here tomorrow night too?
JERRY Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why don't you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin' anything?
LAURA No, I'd love to do something, uh, I have my seminar in the morning, then after that I'm right open.
JERRY Really? What would you like to do?
LAURA Well...now I know this sounds touristy, but I'd just love to go on one of those five-hour-boat-rides around Manhattan.
JERRY Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. I'm just, I'm really glad you're here. Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. Uhm, it's for you.
LAURA Hello?...Hi!...no no it was great, right on time...no, I, I'm gonna stay here tomorrow...yes, yes it's fine..no, we're goin' on a boat-ride...don't be silly...I'm not gonna have this conversation...look I, I'll call you tomorrow...OK, bye . Never get engaged.
JERRY You're engaged?
LAURA You, you really have no idea what it's like until you actually do it and I'm on this emotional roller coaster.
JERRY You're engaged?
LAURA Ya know, I can't believe it myself sometimes. You have to start thinking in terms of "we", uh, it's a very stressful situation.
JERRY You're engaged!
LAURA Yeah...yeah, he's a great guy...
JERRY Yeah.
LAURA You'd really like him...ya know, I can't wait to get on that boat.
JERRY Me too!
JERRY I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I don't get it, OK? I, I, I admit, I, I'm not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, they're so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle...men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, that's it!...It's the only thing we know for sure, it really is: we want women. How do we get them? Oh, we don't know 'bout that, we don't know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas we've had so far...The car-horn-honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks: .
JERRY I'm always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice.. Never quite sure, "Is this the best lane for me? For my life?" They're always a little bit ahead of you, "Can I get in over there? Could I get in over here? Could I get in there?" "Yeah, come on over here, pal. We're zoomin' over here. This is the secret lane, nobody knows about it.." The ultimate, I think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop. Not even rolling. And you look out the window, you can see gum clearly. So we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that. I mean, what will happen? Will it start moving backwords, I wonder? I mean, is that possible? That someday we'll be going "Boy, this is some really bad traffic now, boy. This, is really bad. I'm gonna try to get off and get back on going the other way."
GEORGE She can't kill me right?!
JERRY No, of course not.
GEORGE People break up all the time.
JERRY Everyday.
GEORGE It just didn't work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldn't.
JERRY You tried.
GEORGE I kept looking at her face. I'd go: "C'mon, love her. Love her!"
JERRY Did you tell her you loved her?
GEORGE Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! She'd tell me she loved me. Alright, at first, I just look at her. I'd go "Oh, really?" or "Boy, that's, that's something." But, eventually you have to come back with "Well, I love you." You know, you can only hold out for so long!"
JERRY You're a human being.
GEORGE And I didn't even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? I can't do that to someone.
JERRY You're too nice a guy.
GEORGE I am. I'm a nice guy.. And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, I'm sitting on the couch, she's on the chair - I get up to go to the bathroom, I come back, she's on the couch. What am I supposed to do? Not do anything? I couldn't do that. I would've insulted her.
JERRY You're flesh and blood.
GEORGE I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, I didn't want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But they were everywhere! They kept popping up, all over the place. "This is Nancy, this is Susan, this is Amy.. This is my cousin.. this is my brother.. thisis my father." It's like I'm in quicksand.
JERRY I told you when I met her..
GEORGE My back is killing me.
JERRY You gotta go to my chiropractor, he's the best.
GEORGE Oh yeah, everybody's guy is the best.
JERRY I'm gonna make an appointment for you. We'll go together.
GEORGE Please. They don't do anything.. Look, do I have to break up with her in person? CAn't I do it over the phone? I have no stomach for these things.
JERRY You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right off!
ELAINE Hi.
JERRY Hi.
ELAINE Hey, what are you doing?
GEORGE I'm letting you in.
ELAINE Oh no. No. I don't want to sit in the back. I'll be left out of the conversation.
GEORGE No, you won't.
ELAINE Yes, I will, George. I'll have to sick my chin on top of the seat.
GEORGE Okay..
ELAINE Why can't you sit in the middle?
GEORGE Please, it doesn't look good. Boy, boy, girl.
ELAINE I think you're afraid to sit next to a man. You're a little homophobic, aren't you?
GEORGE Is it that obvious?
ELAINE Hello, Jerry.
JERRY Hello.
ELAINE Did you get a haircut?
JERRY No, shower. So, where are we eating?
ELAINE Tell me if you think this is strange: There's this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. He's a teacher, or something. Anyway, after we met, whenever we'd run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little.. Nothing much. Little pleasantries. He was a nice guy, he's got a family.. then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way. polite nodding. Then one day, he doesn't nod. Like I don't exist?! He went from nods to nothing.
GEORGE "You know, I'd go from nods to nothing.."
ELAINE And now, there's this intense animosity whenever we passs. I mean, it's like we really hate each other. It's based on nothing.
JERRY A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened to The Blob.
GEORGE I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him.
ELAINE Really?
GEORGE Yes.
ELAINE You would do that?
GEORGE If I was a different person.
JERRY Hello.. hello. Is Glenn there? I'm sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?.. Yes, I know I have the wrong number. But I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if..
KRAMER Come on up.
JERRY Oh, it's you again. See? Now if you had answered me, I wouldn't have had to do this. Now that's too long distance calls I made to you why can't you.. . Why? Why do they just hang up like that?! Thank you very much.
KRAMER Taste this.
JERRY No, I just had a sandwich.
KRAMER No, taste it. Taste it.
JERRY I don't want cantaloupe now.
KRAMER You've never had cantaloupe like this before.
JERRY I only eat cantaloupe at certain times.
KRAMER Jerry. This is great cantaloupe.
JERRY Alright..
KRAMER Ah, huh. It's good?
JERRY It's very good.
KRAMER Good, huh?
JERRY Good.
KRAMER I got it at Joe's.
JERRY Uh-Huh.
KRAMER Forty-nine cents a pound. That's practically half than what you're paying at the supermarket. I don't know why you don't go to Joe's.
JERRY It's too far.
KRAMER It's three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..
JERRY I'm not pulling a shopping cart. What am I suppose to wear? A kerchief? Put stockings on and roll 'em down below my knee?
KRAMER See, the other thing is, if you don't like anything, he takes it right back.
JERRY I don't return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.
GEORGE I'm outta there. I did it! It's over.
JERRY You did it? What happened?
GEORGE I told her. In the kitchen - which was risky 'cause it's near all the knives. I started with the word "Listen."
JERRY Ah ha.
GEORGE I said, "Listen Marlene," and then the next thing I know, I'm in the middle of it. And there's this voice inside of me going: "You're doing it! You're doing it!" And then she started to cry, and I weakened a bit. I almost relented, but the voice, Jerry. The voice said "Keep going, keep going. You're almost out!" It's like I was making a prison break, you know. And I'm heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get the front door. I opened it up, I'm one foot away, I took one last look around the penitentiary, and I jumped!
JERRY See, it's never as bad as you imagine.
KRAMER I liked Marlene. What's her number?
GEORGE No, I, I don't think so.
JERRY Could you stop that smacking?
KRAMER George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe.
GEORGE Oh no, thank you.
KRAMER It's the best cantaloupe I ever had.
GEORGE No, really. No, no, thanks.
KRAMER Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.
JERRY It's very good cantaloupe. So that's it? You're out?
GEORGE Except for one small problem. I left some books in her apartment.
JERRY So, go get them.
GEORGE Oh, no. No, I can't go back there. Jerry, it's so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous - sexually. Something could happen, I'd be right back where I started.
JERRY So forget about the books. Did you read them?
GEORGE Well, yeah.
JERRY What do you need them for?
GEORGE I don't know. They're books.
JERRY What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses - like they're trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?
GEORGE They're MY books.
JERRY So you want me to get those books? Is that it?
MARLENE ..So, it must've been ninety-five degrees that night, and everyone's just standing around the pool with little drinks in their hands. I was wearing my old jeans and T-shirt. And I don't know, I was just in one of those moods - so I said to myself, "Marlene, just do it," and I jumped in. And as I'm getting out, I feel all these eyes on me, and I look up and everyone is just staring at me.
JERRY So what'd you do?
MARLENE Well, nothing. It's not skin off my hide if people like to look. I just didn't see what the big attraction was.
JERRY Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess.
MARLENE Hey, you know, Jerry, just because George and I don't see each other anymore, it doesn't mean we shouldn't stay friends.
JERRY No.
MARLENE Good enough. I'm really glad we got that settled.
JERRY I don't know how this happened.
GEORGE Jerry, it's not my fault.
JERRY No, no. It's not your fault. Books, books, I need my books. Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know, it's not like Marlene's a bad person or anything, but, my God! I mean, we've had like three lunches and a movie. And she never stops calling. And it's these meaningless, purposeless, blather calls. She never asks if I'm busy or anything. I just pick up the phone and she's in the middle of a sentence.
GEORGE That's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?
JERRY Ohh.. you know, and sometimes she'll go, "Hello, Jerry?" and I'll go "Oh, hi Marlene." And then it's "Jerry.."
GEORGE What about getting off the phone?
JERRY Ohhhh.. you can't. It's impossible. There's no break in the conversation where you can go, "Alright, then.. " You know, it just goes on and on and on with out a break in the wall. I mean, I gotta put a stop to this.
GEORGE Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion, right off! She is sexy though. Don't you think?
JERRY Yeah. Yes, she is.
RECEPTIONIST Mr. Costanza?
GEORGE Yeah.
RECEPTIONIST The doctor'll see you now.
GEORGE Yeah, doctor. I'm going to have to wait in that little room by myself, aren't I? I better take this. I hate the little room. "Oh, hello, Doctor."
JERRY Waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. 'Cause it says "Waiting room." There's no chance of not waiting, 'cause they call it the waiting room, they're going to use it. They've got it. It's all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and you've got your little magazine. You pretend you're reading it, but you're really looking at the other people. You know, you're thinking about about them things like "I wonder what he's got. As soon as she goes, I'm getting her magazine." And then, they finally call you and it's a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room. "Well, I guess I've been chosen. I'll see you all later." You know, so you think you're going to see the doctor, but you're not, are you? No. You're going into the next waiting room. The littler waiting room. But if they are, you know, doing some sort of medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest room that they have, I think. You don't wnat to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I mean? You ever see these operating theaters, that they have, with like, stadium seating? You don't want them doing antying to you that makes other doctors go, "I have to see this!" "Are you kidding? Are they really gonna do that to him?" "Are there seats? Can we get in?" Do they scalp tickets to these things? "I got two for the Winslow tumor, I got two.."
JERRY So, how was it?
GEORGE I was in there for two minutes. He didn't do anything. Touch this, feel that. Seventy-five bucks.
JERRY Well, it's a first visit.
GEORGE What's seventy-five bucks? What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?! Amd I being entertained? I don't understand this. I'm only paying half.
JERRY You can't do that.
GEORGE Why not?
JERRY He's a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.
GEORGE Oh, no, no, no. I pay what I say.
MARLENE Are you feeling weird?
JERRY No, I'm fine.
MARLENE Nothing really happened.
JERRY Yeah, I know.
MARLENE We just kissed a little. People kiss.
JERRY Yeah.
MARLENE Well.. night.
JERRY Good night.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER I got it! This time, I got it!
JERRY Alright.
KRAMER Hips! See, it's all hips.
JERRY Uh-huh.
KRAMER You gotta come through with the hips first.
JERRY That is out there.
KRAMER Joe's?
JERRY No, supermarket.
KRAMER Well, is it good?
JERRY It's okay.
KRAMER Let me taste it. See, that stinks. You can't eat that. You should take it back.
JERRY I'm not taking it back.
KRAMER Alright, I'll take it back. I'm going by there.
JERRY I don't care about it.
KRAMER Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation.
JERRY Alright. Take it back.
JERRY Leave a message, I'll call you back.
MARLENE Jerry, have you ever taken a bath in the dark? If I'm not talking into the soap right now, call me back.
KRAMER Well?
JERRY Marlene
KRAMER Oh. Oh, Marlene.
JERRY Yeah, I took her home one night - we kinda started up a little bit in the car.
KRAMER I thought you were trying to get rid of her?
JERRY I was. She's got me, like, hypnotized.
KRAMER Does George know?
JERRY No, he'd go nuts.
KRAMER Yeah, no kidding.
JERRY I feel terrible. I mean, I've seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I can't go any further, but.. I've just got this like, psycho-sexual hold over me. I just want her, I can't breathe. It's like a drug.
KRAMER Woah, psycho-sexual.
JERRY I don't know how I'm going to tell him.
KRAMER Man, I don't understand people. I mean, why would George want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?
JERRY It's partially you, yeah.
KRAMER You're his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else. Some jerk that he doesn't even know.
JERRY Well, he can't kill me, right?
KRAMER You're a human being.
JERRY I mean, she called me. I haven't called her. She started it.
KRAMER You're flesh and blood.
JERRY I'm a nice guy.
ELAINE Hi.
JERRY Oh, my little airplane lamp.
ELAINE You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones.
JERRY Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don't have to be home on time.
ELAINE Unless you're married to a dictator..
JERRY Yeah.. because they would be very demanding people.
ELAINE Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point, somebody's going to offer me some cantaloupe.
KRAMER Nope. No good.
JERRY Well, you know what they say: Luck in love, Unlucky with fruit.
KRAMER Well, I'm taking this back.
ELAINE So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.
JERRY Really? That guy who stopped saying hello?
ELAINE Yep.
JERRY You talked to him?
ELAINE Yep. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought "no, no, no, no. Do not be afraid of this man."
JERRY Right.
ELAINE So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, "Hi, remember me?" And he furrows his brow as if he's really trying to figure it out. So I said to him, I said, "You little phony. You know exactly who I am."
JERRY "You little phony"?
ELAINE I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, "Oh, yeah. You're Jeanette's friend. We did meet once." And I said, "Well, how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by?"
JERRY Amazing.
ELAINE And he says, he says, "Look, I just didn't want to say hello anymore, alright?" And I said, "Fine. Fine I didn't want to say hello anymore either, but I wanted you to know that I'm aware of it."
JERRY You are the Queen of Confrontation. You're my new hero. In fact, you've inspired me. I'm gonna call George about something right now.
ELAINE This cantaloupe stinks.
GEORGE I don't care.
JERRY You're kidding.
GEORGE No, I don't care.
JERRY You mean that?
GEORGE Absolutely.
JERRY You don't care?
GEORGE No.
JERRY How could you not care?
GEORGE I don't know. But I don't. I'm actually almost happy to hear it.
JERRY I thought you'd be upset.
GEORGE I guess I should be but I'm not.
JERRY Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?
GEORGE No, you're a fine person. You're a humanitarian. She's very sexy.
JERRY That voice. That voice. She's driving me crazy.
GEORGE I know, I know.
JERRY So I can see her tonight, and you don't care?
GEORGE See her tonight. See her tomarrow. Go. Knock yourself out. She's too crazy for me.
JERRY Alright. As long as you're okay. Because I can't stop thinking about her.
GEORGE I'm okay. I'm fine. I'm wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life.
JERRY Good. And I'll tell you what.. You don't have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill.
GEORGE You paid that crook?!
JERRY I had to.
GEORGE He didn't do anything, Jerry. It's a scam! Who told you to do that?
JERRY It was embarrassing to me.
GEORGE I was trying to make a point.
JERRY Why don't you make a point with your own doctor? What's wrong?
GEORGE I think I swallowed a fly! ..I swallowed a fly! What do I do? What can happen?
JERRY ..So, you want to come up for a few minutes?
MARLENE ..I'm sorry, Jerry. I just don't think this is going to work.
JERRY Really? I thought..
MARLENE I know, I'm sorry.
JERRY I guess I just didn't expect it from the way you've been acting.
MARLENE You sure you want to talk about this? 'Cause I sure don't.
JERRY Of course I want to talk about it.
MARLENE Well, okay. I guess things changed for me on Tuesday night.
JERRY Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night?
MARLENE ..I saw your act.
JERRY My act? What does that have to do with anything?
MARLENE Well, to be honest, it just didn't make it for me. It's just so much fluff.
JERRY I can't believe this. So what are you saying? You didn't like my act, so that's it?
MARLENE I can't be with someone if I don't respect what they do.
JERRY You're a cashier!
MARLENE Look, Jerry, it's just not my kind of humor.
JERRY You can't go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible.
MARLENE I heard the material.
JERRY I have other stuff. You should come see me on the weekend.
JERRY Women need to like the job of the guy they're with. If they don't like the job, they don't like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony bogus names for the jobs that we have. "Well, right now, I'm the regional management supervisor." "I'm in development, research, consulting." Men on the other hand, if they are physically attracted to a woman are not that concerned with her job. Are we? Men don't really care. Men'll just go, "Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that where you work? That sounds interesting. So whatdya got a big cleaver there? You're just lopping their heads off? That sounds great! Listen, why don't you shower up, and we'll get some burgers and catch a movie."
JERRY So why don't you get a locksmith?
GEORGE I was going to, but then I found out that the auto club has this free locksmith service, so I signed up. Just waiting for the membership to kick in.
JERRY How long has your car been sitting in the Yankee parking lot?
GEORGE I don't know, about three days.
JERRY Y-you're not playin' golf?
KRAMER Yes, indeed. The calendar says winter, but he gods of spring are out.
GEORGE Are the courses open?
KRAMER No, no........I'm sneaking in with Stan the Caddy, we've been going through the caddies entrance. George. Huh, No kidding?
KRAMER Yeah, and I'll tell ya something else. Stan's advice has transformed my game. He's never wrong. Oh, he thinks eventually I'll have a shot at making it big on the senior tour. Oh, that's my dream, Jerry.
JERRY Really, you're getting that good?
KRAMER Oh, I'm the real deal.
KRAMER Yeah, here, Stan, in here!
KRAMER There he is, yeah - Jerry, George, this is Stan the Caddy.
GEORGE How ya doin'?
JERRY Hi.
STAN Nice to meet you. Ready to hit the links, Kramer?
KRAMER Oh yeah, you betcha.
STAN What are those, ah, cotton pants?
KRAMER Yeah...Why, is it too cold out?
STAN Here's what you do: you bring a lightweight jacket, that way the sun comes out, you play the jacket off the sweater.
KRAMER Ah, that makes sense, that's a good call, Stan. Alright, we'll see you guys later, huh?
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY Yeah, we'll see ya.
JERRY_AND_GEORGE Stan The Caddy.
SUE_ELLEN Elaine?
SUE_ELLEN Hi!
ELAINE Oh, great. It's the bra-less wonder. Who does she think she's kidding? Look at her, she's totally out of control.
SUE_ELLEN I was thinking that woman looks like Elaine Benes.
ELAINE Yeah, ha ha ha. What have you been up to?
SUE_ELLEN I've just been hanging out.
ELAINE I see.
SUE_ELLEN Oh, listen! I'm having a birthday party tomorrow evening, I'd love it if you came by.
ELAINE Tomorrow...? I don't know if I can.
SUE_ELLEN Nooo?
ELAINE Yeah, I'm just really, really busy.
SUE_ELLEN Oh, that's too bad.
ELAINE Yeah.
SUE_ELLEN Well, I hope you can get me a gift anyway.........ha ha ha.
ELAINE Ha ha ha.
WILHELM George!?
GEORGE Mr. Wilhelm!
WILHELM I'm sorry to interrupt you, but Mr Steinbrenner and I really want you to know we appreciate all the hours you've been putting in....And, ah, confidentially, Sozonkel, our Assistant to the General Manger, hasn't really been working out. And the boos thinks, you're the man for the job! So, keep it under your hat!
GEORGE Assistant to the General Manager!! You know what means?!? He'd could be askin' my advice on trades! Trades, Jerry, I'm a heartbeat away!
JERRY That's a hell of an organization they're running up there. I can't understand why they haven't won a pennant in 15 years.
GEORGE And, it is all because of that car. You see, Steinbrenner is like the first guy in, at the crack of dawn. He sees my car, he figures I'm the first guy in. Then, the last person to leave is Wilhelm. He see my car, he figures I'm burning the midnight oil. Between the two of them, they think I'm working an 18 hour day!
JERRY Locking your keys in your car is the best career move you ever made.
ELAINE Hey.
JERRY Hey.
GEORGE Hey, how ya doing?!?
ELAINE Better, now.
JERRY yeah, what happened?
ELAINE You know Sue Ellen Mishke?
JERRY Sue Ellen Mishke?
ELAINE Yeah, the woman I grew up with in Maryland, she moved here last year...
JERRY Sounds familiar.
ELAINE The heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune--
JERRY Oh, yeah, you mentioned her.
ELAINE Yes. I ran into her today. This woman has never, not once, ever, as long as I have known her, worn a bra.
GEORGE Ah, that is disgusting--
JERRY That is just shameless, I don't know, There's no--
GEORGE The woman's a pig, what wrong with her--
JERRY It's wrong, it's rude, and it's--
GEORGE It's disgusting--
ELAINE Alright, there's no---
GEORGE Come on! Come-on.
JERRY We're only kidding!
ELAINE You don't understand. See, she hasn't changed at all. She stole my boyfriend when I was in high school. I was at this party, and I was dating this really cute guy, his name was Tom Cosley, by the way, and she goes walking by, in this little floozy outfit, and he follows her, right out the door!
JERRY She's your Lex Luthor!
ELAINE Her birthday's comin' up, so I decided to get her a little present.
JERRY What are you going to get her?
ELAINE A very traditional, a very supportive, brazier.
JERRY There's nothing subtle about that.
GEORGE No, no, she might just think its a gift.
JERRY Have I ever bought you a jock strap as a gift?
GEORGE Ahhh, Hey-Ho.
JERRY What the hell are you doing here, aren't you supposed to be at work?!?
GEORGE Yeah, well I'm thinking about getting out of town with Susan for a few days....Her parents rebuilt the cabin!
JERRY So, you're just taking off from work?
GEORGE They won't know. I got the car there.
JERRY Do you think this is such a good idea, with you being on the verge of this big promotion?
GEORGE My presence, in that office, can only hurt my chances.
ELAINE Sue Ellen Mishke? Ah, alright, send her in.
SUE_ELLEN Hi Elaine.
ELAINE Hellllloo.
SUE_ELLEN I happened to be in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd stop in, and thank you for your lovely gift.
ELAINE Ohhhhh. You're....welcome.
SUE_ELLEN Is anything wrong?
ELAINE Well, Sue Ellen, it's a, it's not a top, it's a bra.
SUE_ELLEN Oh, I know. Thanks again.
GEORGE This is the life! Isn't it, huh, kid?
SUSAN Wanna check out a swap meet?
GEORGE Yeah, maybe. Where'd you get that?
SUSAN Oh, it was on the windshield of the car when we came out of that rest stop.
JERRY Yello.
GEORGE Hey, hey, it's George, I need ya to do me a favor.
JERRY What's goin' on?
GEORGE I just remembered, there's this Chinese restaurant out near Yankee Stadium, that puts flyers on all the cars.
JERRY Yeah, so?
GEORGE Alright, this is what ya gotta do: I need ya to go out to the parking lot at Yankee Stadium, and take the flyers off my car.
JERRY You know last time you had me throwin' a rye bread up three floors to you, now you want me to go up to the Bronx, take flyers off your car, where does it end?!?
GEORGE Alright, alright. I'll drive the 4 hours each way, 6 hours all together, and take 'em off myself!!
JERRY Alright, alright, I'll do it!!
JERRY Hey, what are ya up to? Kramer. Nothin'.
JERRY Do ya wanna go with me up to the Bronx and see if there's any flyers on George's car.
KRAMER Sure!
JERRY I guess I coulda said just about anything there, couldn't I?
KRAMER yep.
JERRY Oh, man, look at this mess! You know what's gonna happen if they see this? What are we gonna do?
KRAMER I don't know.
JERRY Well, we gotta get it washed....Ah, the keys are locked inside!
KRAMER Wait a second....
JERRY What are ya gonna do?
KRAMER I'll just snag the lock with this. Here we go...
JERRY Yeah, this quite a life I lead here, huh?
KRAMER George has gotta be happy about this.
JERRY Yeah, yeah, yeah...
JERRY Oh my God, Kramer, is that woman just wearing a bra?
KRAMER Oh, mama.
JERRY Kramer!!!
ELAINE My God, are you okay?
KRAMER I got a cut on my head and I banged my shoulder.
JERRY I guess I have to bring his car back up to the stadium, if it can make it.
ELAINE So how did this happen?
JERRY He was starin' at some woman!
KRAMER I couldn't help it, you saw what she was wearing.
ELAINE What woman?
JERRY There was this beautiful woman walking down the street wearing just a bra. I can't get that image out of my mind.
ELAINE Oh...my God.
JERRY What?
ELAINE Was it a tall woman, in a black blazer?
JERRY Yeah!
ELAINE Ohhh! That's Sue Ellen Mishke!
JERRY Sue Ellen Mishke?
ELAINE That's the bra I gave here, she's wearing it as a top! The woman is walking around in broad daylight with nothing but a bra on, she's a menace to society.
KRAMER You know, my arm really hurts. I wonder if its gonna affect my golf swing.
STAN I got your message, how's the shoulder?
KRAMER Yeah, it's my left arm, I can't swing it!
STAN No, no. Not the left arm!
KRAMER What happens if I can't play like I was? What about the tour, and all my dreams?
ELAINE Oh! I got it! Let's sue her!
KRAMER Sue her?
ELAINE Yeah, she's loaded. She's the heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
KRAMER No, no, no, I can't. I learned my lesson from that coffee company.
ELAINE Kramer, listen to me. Listen! This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Your dreams have been shattered, somebody's got to be held accountable. Come on, we'll take for every penny she's got!
KRAMER What do you think, Stan?
STAN Let's go for the green! You know a good lawyer?
JACKIE So you're driving in the car, you're with your friend, minding your own business?
KRAMER Yeah.
JACKIE Then what happened?
KRAMER The we saw this woman, and she was wearing a bra with no top.
JACKIE No top? She didn't have a top on?
KRAMER No. So I got distracted and I crashed the car.
JACKIE Well how would you describe this woman? Would you say she was an attractive woman?
KRAMER Oh, yeah.
JACKIE So we got an attractive woman, wearing a bra, no top, walkin' around in broad daylight. She's flouting society's conventions!
KRAMER She was flouting.
JACKIE That's totally inappropriate. It's lewd, vesivius, salacious, outrageous!
KRAMER It was outrageous. And she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
JACKIE Could you repeat that?
KRAMER I said she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
JACKIE O'Henry? That's one of our top-selling candy bars. It's got chocolate, peanuts, nougat, it's delicious, scrumptious, outstanding! Have you been to a doctor?
KRAMER No.
JACKIE Susie, call Dr. Bison, set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer, tell him it's for me.
KRAMER So whadda ya think, Jackie? I mean we got a case?
JACKIE Like taking candy from a baby.
GEORGE I think I got it. How 'bout this? How 'bout this? We trade Jim Leyritz and Bernie Williams, for Barry Bonds, huh? Whadda ya think? That way you have Griffey and Bonds, in the same outfield! Now you got a team! Ha ha ha.
SUSAN I don't know, George. I'm still worried about this car thing.
GEORGE Would ya stop worrying?
SUSAN Well, what about the flyers?
GEORGE Jerry took the flyers off the car, I got the whole thing covered.
STEINBRENNER Come in!
STEINBRENNER Ah, Wilhelm.
WILHELM Mr. Steinbrenner, I am very concerned about George Costanza.
STEINBRENNER How 'bout a 'good morning'?
WILHELM Yes sir, good morning, good morning, sir.
STEINBRENNER Good morning to you, Wilhelm.
WILHELM Anyway, his car's in the parking lot, the front end is based in, and there's blood in the car, and we can't find him anywhere. Obviously he was in some sort of terrible car accident, and, trooper that he is, he tried to make it into work, sir.
STEINBRENNER Alright, Wilhelm, listen to me. I want the stadium scoured. He could be bleeding to death in the bullpen. Put everyone on alert, check all the area hospitals, clinics, shelters, we've gotta find that kid.
WILHELM Yes sir, yes sir.
STEINBRENNER We must find George, find him, Wilhelm!
SUE_ELLEN Excuse me, do you happen to know the gentleman across the hall?
JERRY Yes, yes, I do.
SUE_ELLEN Do you happen to know if he'll be back anytime soon?
JERRY No, I don't.
SUE_ELLEN Oh...
JERRY Is there something I can help you with?
SUE_ELLEN No, I really just needed to speak with him.
JERRY Well, you can wait for him in here if you like.
SUE_ELLEN Oh, maybe I will.
SUE_ELLEN If you don't mind.
JERRY No, no, not at all.
SUE_ELLEN Thanks.
JERRY I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
STEINBRENNER What is with these people, all day long. Come in, come in.
WILHELM Ah, Mr. Steinbrenner, you know, we've searched everywhere, there's no sign of him. Not even anyone who remotely fits his description, sir.
STEINBRENNER Oh my God, do you know what this means, Wilhelm?
WILHELM What, sir?
STEINBRENNER He's dead! Costanza's dead!
WILHELM Well, no, no, you see, I don't think--
STEINBRENNER As quickly as he came here, he's gone. The poor little guy! Easy. Easy, big Stein, get it together. Ok, Wilhelm.
WILHELM Yessir?
STEINBRENNER Find out where his parents live.
WILHELM Parents.
STEINBRENNER I'm gonna personally notify them. ...and, ah, line up some candidates to fill that assistant to the General Manager position, we can't grieve forever! We gotta get back to business! Back to Business Wilhelm!
KRAMER Well, buddy, he's taking the case! Jackie Chiles is right on it! Right on it, he's all over it!
JERRY Oh, really?
KRAMER Why, wh-wh-what's wrong, come on?
JERRY I don't know, so the woman was walking around in a bra, I mean it's no big deal. You're still drivin'. You should have been watching the road.
KRAMER Well, your attitude has certainly changed.
JERRY I don't think my attitude has changed.
KRAMER Now listen, Jerry, I'm gonna need you to testify.
JERRY Well, I don't know if I....
KRAMER Jerry, Jerry, you gotta testify!
JERRY I don't think I--
KRAMER Listen, this is a million dollars we're talkin' about, Jerry, now this is the big league, the big time, now I need you on my team, Jerry!
JERRY Well, I'm just not sure how I feel about it, Kramer.
KRAMER Alright what's gotten into you, what's happened?!?
JERRY Nothing's happened.
KRAMER Goohhhhck.
KRAMER Ohhhh, what's this?
JERRY Oh, no, no, no, wait a second, wait a second,...
KRAMER I see....Yessss. Little Miss Candy Bar paid a visit, didn't she?
JERRY Kramer, it is not what you think.
KRAMER Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh! I know what I think. I think you're gaga over this dame. She's twisted you around her little finger, and now, you're willing to sell me, and Elaine, and whoever else you have to, right down the river.
JERRY And what about yooou?!? Tryin' to bilk an innocent bystander out of a family fortune, built on sweat and toil, manufacturing quality O'Henry candy bars, for honest, hard-working Americans!
KRAMER You're just out for sex!
JERRY You're just out for money!
KRAMER_AND_JERRY Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh!
STEINBRENNER Mrs. Costanza?
ESTELLE Yesss?
STEINBRENNER My name is George Steinbrenner, I'm afraid I have some very sad new about your son.
ESTELLE I can't believe it, he was so young. How could this have happened?
STEINBRENNER Well, he'd been logging some pretty heavy hours, first one in in the morning, last one to leave at night. That kid was a human dynamo.
ESTELLE Are you sure you're talking about George?
STEINBRENNER You are Mr. and Mrs. Costanza?
FRANK What the hell did you trade Jay Buhner for?!? He had 30 home runs, over 100 RBIs last year, he's got a rocket for an arm, you don't know what the hell you're doin'!!
STEINBRENNER Well, Buener was a good prospect, no question about it. But my baseball people love Ken Phelps' bat. They kept saying 'Ken Phelps , Ken Phelps'.
FRANK Jerry, it's Frank Costanza, Mr. Steinbrenner is here, George is dead, call me back!
JERRY Hello?
GEORGE Hey, it's George.
JERRY Where have you been?!?
GEORGE What?
JERRY I just got the most bizarre message from you father, Steinbrenner is at you house, they think you're dead!
GEORGE Dead?
JERRY Yeah, and we had an accident with your car, it's a little crumpled.
GEORGE My car is a little crumpled?!?
JERRY Yeah, yeah, I didn't know what to do so I put it back at the stadium. Oh, wait a second, wait a second, they saw the car, they saw the blood, they couldn't find ya, and now that's why Steinbrenner thinks you're dead!
GEORGE Okay, I gotta head back right away, I'll -- I gotta figure something out here.
JERRY Well you gotta call your parents.
GEORGE I can't, Steinbrenner might still be there!
JERRY Aren't you gonna tell your parents you're still alive?
GEORGE Nnnooo! They could use the break!
PETERMAN Elaine, do you see this? Do you see what I'm holding is my hands?
ELAINE Yeah, it's a bra.
PETERMAN I saw a woman in our hallway wearing one of these as a top. What exquisite beauty, I ran down the hallway to talk to her, but the elevator door closed. It was not to be. Perhaps our paths will cross again some day.
ELAINE What is this all about?
PETERMAN I wanna market this item as a new direction in women's Fitzgerald, aaaand, somebody in the 20s, wearing this at wild parties, driving all the men crazy.....Have it on my desk by the end of the week.
STEINBRENNER Come in, come in.
GEORGE Mr. Steinbrenner--
STEINBRENNER Ahhh, Ahhh! Ah, ah ah! Is it you?
GEORGE Yeah, it's me sir. It's been a harrowing few days. After the car accident, I crawled into a ditch and managed to survive on grubs and puddle water, until a kindly old gentleman picked me up.
STEINBRENNER Grubs, huh? Gotta admit, I never tasted one of those.
GEORGE Anyway, as I was lying in the puddle, I think I may have found a way for us to get Bonds and Griffey, and we wouldn't have to give up that much.
STEINBRENNER Well, don't tell it to me George, tell it to the new Assistant to the General Manager.
GEORGE I didn't get the job?
STEINBRENNER Well, once you were dead, we couldn't just sit on our hands. We had to make a move...
STEINBRENNER But, you still have your old job. Of course, we'll have to dock you for the time you missed. We're running a ball club here. If I give special treatment to you, everyone will want it. Next thing you know its chaos! And I can tell you this, chaos does not work for the New York Yankees! Not as long as I'm running the show!
JACKIE So it was the meeting on the street that prompted you to buy the bra for Miss Mishke, would you say that was correct?
ELAINE Yes...ummm, yes, that's correct.
JACKIE And you have also brought with you, another bra, exactly like the one that she so flagrantly exhibited herself in!
ELAINE Yes, that's correct.
JACKIE What was you golf score, the last round you played...before you shoulder was injured?
KRAMER Three under par.
JACKIE Oooohhhh, three under par...That's what the professionals shoot, isn't it?
KRAMER If they're lucky.
JACKIE Would you tell this jury exactly what you saw on the corner of 83rd Street and Columbus?
JERRY I...don't remember.
JACKIE Well, did you, or did you not, see the defendant, wearing the bra?
JERRY I don't know. Maybe.
JACKIE Mr. Seinfeld, I might remind you that you are under oath. Now I ask you again, did you or did you not, see this woman wearing the bra?!?
JERRY ....Alright, alright, I saw her! And she was beautiful in that bra! I'm crazy about her! I love her whole free swinging, free wheeling attitude!
JUDGE This court will come to order!
JACKIE No further questions, your honor.
JUDGE You may step down.
JACKIE I think we got this wrapped up.
KRAMER Yeah, yeah...What's your read, Stan?
STAN You're close, you're on the green. You just have to go for the cup.
KRAMER What do you mean?
STAN Have her try on the bra, see if it fits.
JACKIE No, no, no, no!
KRAMER Do it, Jackie. Stan's the man.
JACKIE Stan? Who the hell is Stan?
KRAMER He's my caddy.
JACKIE You're caddy?!? This is a big mistake!
KRAMER G- cada-
JACKIE Your honor, we request at this time, that Miss Mishke...try on the bra.
JUDGE This court will come to order! Go ahead Miss Mishke, try it on.
SUE_ELLEN Ah, it doesn't fit...I can't put it on.
JACKIE Damn fools! Look at that! We got nothin' now, nothin'! I've been practicing law for 25 years, you're listenin' to a caddy! This is a public humiliation! You can't let the defendant have control of the key piece of evidence. Plus, she's trying it on over a leotard, of course a bra's not gonna fit on over a leotard. A bra gotta fit right up a person's skin, like a glove!
WOMAN_1 Oh, hey, Elaine, how 'bout some lunch?
ELAINE Oh, no, I don't think so.
WOMAN_2 Great job on the Gatzby Swing Top. It's a winner.
ELAINE Yeah, yeah, thanks.
WOMAN_1 Are you sure you don't wanna go? We have reservations.
ELAINE Oh, I don't think you'll have any trouble gettin' a table.
WOMAN_1 Ciao.
WOMAN_2 Ba-bye.
GEORGE Well, you got no place to go. I'll tell you what your problem is: You brought your queen out too fast. What do you think? She's one of these feminists looking to get out of the house? No, the queen is old fashioned. . Likes to stay home. Cook. Take care of her man. Make sure he feels good.
LIZ Checkmate.
GEORGE I don't think we should see each other any more.
ELAINE Shut up! Shut up! You stupid mutt.
JERRY And you broke up with her 'cuz she beat you at chess? That's pretty sick.
GEORGE I don't see how I could perform sexually in a situation after something like that. I was completely emasculated. Anyway, it's not the only reason.
JERRY Yeah, what else?
GEORGE All right. You wanna know what one of her favorite expressions is? Happy, Pappy?
JERRY Happy, Pappy? What does that mean?
GEORGE Like if she wants to know if I'm pleased with something, she'll say, "Happy, Pappy?"
JERRY Oh, you're "Pappy".
GEORGE I'm "Pappy".
JERRY Oh, I get it. Why don't you just say it?
GEORGE Oh, come on. What, are you kidding?
GEORGE I'm much more comfortable criticizing people behind their backs. Anyway, look who's talking. You just broke up with with Melanie last week because she "shuushed you" while you were watching TV.
JERRY Hey, I got a real thing about "shushing"!
GEORGE What is this? Did you ever get the feeling like you've had a haircut but you didn't have one? I'm all itchy back here.
JERRY Ahh.
GEORGE What?
JERRY What is this? What are we doing? What in god's name are we doing?
GEORGE What?
JERRY Our lives! What kind of lives are these? We're like children. We're not men.
GEORGE No, we're not. We're not men.
JERRY We come up with all these stupid reasons to break up with these women.
GEORGE I know. I know. That's what I do. That's what I do.
JERRY Are we going to be sitting here when we're sixty like two idiots?
GEORGE We should be having dinner with our sons when we're sixty.
JERRY We're pathetic.. you know that?
GEORGE Yeah, like I don't know that I'm pathetic.
JERRY Why can't I be normal?
GEORGE Yes. Me, too. I wanna be normal. Normal.
JERRY It would be nice to care about someone.
GEORGE Yes. Yes. Care. You know who I think about a lot? Remember Susan? The one that used to work for NBC?
JERRY Hmm. I thought she became a lesbian.
GEORGE No. It didn't take.
JERRY Oh.
GEORGE Did I tell you I ran into her last week? Ho-ho, she looked great.
JERRY Hmm.
GEORGE You thought she was good looking, right?
JERRY See, there you go again. What is the difference what I think?
GEORGE I was just curious.
JERRY Well, this is it. I'm really gonna do something about my life, you know? You know, I think I'm gonna call Melanie again. So what if she shushed me.
GEORGE I am really gonna make some changes.
GEORGE Yes. Changes.
JERRY I'm serious about it.
GEORGE Think I'M not?
JERRY I'm not kidding.
GEORGE Me too.
JERRY Melanie, you can shush me at every opportunity. Oh, it was just an expression. All right, well, that's very sweet of you. Okay, I'll call you later. All right, bye. Hey!
KRAMER What?
JERRY I had a very interesting lunch with George Costanza today.
KRAMER Really?
JERRY We were talking about our lives and we both kind of realized we're kids. We're not men.
KRAMER So, then you asked yourselves, "Isn't there something more to life?"
JERRY Yes. We did.
KRAMER Yeah, well, let me clue you in on something. There isn't.
JERRY There isn't?
KRAMER Absolutely not. I mean, what are you thinking about, Jerry? Marriage? Family?
JERRY Well...
KRAMER They're prisons. Man made prisons. You're doing time. You get up in the morning. She's there. You go to sleep at night. She's there. It's like you gotta ask permission to use the bathroom. Is it all right if I use the bathroom now?
JERRY Really?
KRAMER Yeah, and you can forget about watching TV while you're eating.
JERRY I can?
KRAMER Oh, yeah. You know why? Because it's dinner time. And you know what you do at dinner?
JERRY What?
KRAMER You talk about your day. How was your day today? Did you have a good day today or a bad day today? Well, what kind of day was it? Well, I don't know. How about you? How was your day?
JERRY Boy.
KRAMER It's sad, Jerry. It's a sad state of affairs..
JERRY I'm glad we had this talk.
KRAMER Oh, you have no idea.
GEORGE La-la-la...
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey.
ELAINE Three hours of sleep again last night.. Three hours of sleep because of that dog.
KRAMER What dog?
KRAMER Yeah. What dog?
ELAINE This dog in the courtyard across from my bedroom window that never never stops barking..
KRAMER Don't...
ELAINE I lost my voice screaming at this thing. I can't sleep. I can't work. I mean, I just moved. I can't move again. What am I gonna do? What? What am I gonna do?
KRAMER Well, there is something you can do.
ELAINE What? Kramer:, I'll do anything.
KRAMER Well, what if there should be an unfortunate accident?
JERRY You're going to rub out the dog?
KRAMER No, no. Not me. I just happen to know someone who specializes in exactely these kinds of sticky situations.
ELAINE Uh-huh.
JERRY What, you're considering this?
KRAMER Look, just meet with him. ?????.
ELAINE I don't really know why I'm here. Kramer talked me into coming up here. But, obviously, I could never really do anything.
NEWMAN Of course. Obviously.
ELAINE Uh, so, anyway, I'm sorry for wasting your time.
NEWMAN What kind of dog did you say it was?
ELAINE Um, I don't know. I've never really seen it.
NEWMAN I see many dogs on my mail route. I'll bet there's not one type of mutt or mongrel I haven't run across.
NEWMAN If you ask me, they have no business living amongst us. Vile, useless beasts.
KRAMER Newman! Stop it!!
NEWMAN Anyway.
ELAINE Yeah. Well um, I was just curious if I were interested in availing myself of your services, um, what exactly would you do?
NEWMAN Well, Elaine, there's any number of things I could do. But, I can promise you this, though, this vicious beast will never bother you again. So, what's it going to be?
ELAINE No, I'm sorry. I can't hurt a dog. I can't hurt a dog. I can't.
KRAMER I got it. We'll kidnap him . and we'll drop him off Upstate and this way he won't bother you anymore and he won't get hurt.
NEWMAN Yeah, I suppose.
KRAMER Huh?
ELAINE I'd have to think about it. I doubt it, though. I doubt it. I'll let you know.
NEWMAN Of course. Take your time. I'll be here. is still at the pier. His thoughts shift somewhat.
GEORGE La-la-la-la-la-la-la!
ELAINE All right. Let's do it.
NEWMAN Excellent. Excellent.
JERRY How come you're eating your peas one at a time? Melanie I'm sorry.
SUSAN Who is it?
GEORGE It's George:.
SUSAN George:? George:, what is it?
GEORGE Will you marry me?
GEORGE Ma, guess what!
ESTELLE Oh, my god!
GEORGE No, it's nothing bad. I'm getting married.
ESTELLE You're what?
GEORGE I'm getting married?
ESTELLE Oh, my god! You're getting married?
GEORGE Yes!
ESTELLE Oh, I can't believe it. Frank, come here.
FRANK You come here.
ESTELLE Georgie's getting married.
FRANK What?
ESTELLE Georgie's getting married.
FRANK Get the hell out of here. He's getting married?
ESTELLE Yes.
FRANK To a woman?
ESTELLE Of course to a woman. What's she look like?
FRANK I'm sure she's pretty gorgeous.
GEORGE What difference does it make what she looks like?
ESTELLE Is she pretty?
GEORGE Yes, she's pretty. What difference does it make?
ESTELLE Oh, I'm just curious.
FRANK She's not pretty?
ESTELLE Let me talk to her.
GEORGE She wants to talk to you.
SUSAN Uh, hello?
ESTELLE Congratulations!
SUSAN I just want you to know that I love your son very much.
ESTELLE You do?
SUSAN Yes.
ESTELLE Really?
SUSAN Yes.
ESTELLE May I ask why?
FRANK Okay...
ESTELLE Will you stop. I'm on the telephone.
FRANK Can I talk to her, please?
JERRY Hey!
KRAMER Hey!
JERRY What are you up to?
KRAMER Nothing.
JERRY What's the rope for?
KRAMER Oh! Well, How do you like that. I got rope. Um, I gotta go.
JERRY The dog. You're getting the dog.
GEORGE Hey, Kramer:, where are you going?
KRAMER Out.
GEORGE Don't go. Kramer! Come back. I got great news. Well, I did it.
JERRY Did what?
GEORGE I got engaged. I'm getting married. I asked Susan: to marry me. We're getting married this Christmas.
JERRY You're getting married?
GEORGE Yes!
JERRY Oh, my god!
GEORGE I'm a man. Jerry:, I'm a man. And do you know why? It's because of that talk we had. You were my inspiration. Do you believe it? You. That lunch was the defining moment of my life.
JERRY I'm blown away.
GEORGE You're blown?
JERRY Wow!
GEORGE You like that?
JERRY And she said "Yes"?
GEORGE It took a couple of hours of convincing. I was just like those guys in the movies. And it worked! She said "Yes"! I can't believe my luck that she was still available . A beautiful woman like that. You think she's good looking, right?
JERRY You're gonna have gorgeous kids.
GEORGE Yes. She's got great skin - a rosy glow..
JERRY Pinkish hue?
GEORGE Oh, she's got the hue. So, what's going on with you and Melanie? I mean, I know you're not getting married, but uh, things are happening?
JERRY Well...actually, we kind of broke up.
GEORGE You what?
JERRY Well, you know, we were having dinner the other night, and she's got this strangest habit. She eats her peas one at a time. You've never seen anything like it. It takes her an hour to finish them. I mean, we've had dinner other times. I've seen her eat Corn Niblets. 4But she scooped them.
GEORGE . . . she scooped her niblets?
JERRY Yes. That's what was so vexing.
GEORGE Uh-huh. Uh-huh. What about the pact?
JERRY What?
GEORGE What happened to the pact? We were both gonna change. We shook hands on a pact. 9Did you not shake my hand on it uh?
JERRY You stuck your hand out, so I shook it. I don't know about a pact. Anyway, you should be happy you're engaged. You're getting married.
GEORGE Well, it's not that. I just, you know, I thought that we were both uh...
JERRY You thought I was gonna get married?
GEORGE Well, maybe not married, but...
JERRY I mean, you love Susan: , right?
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY You want to spend the rest of your life with her
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY So?
GEORGE Yeah. It doesn't make any difference.
JERRY No. So, we're still on to see uh, Firestorm tonight?
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY I'll pick you up at your apartment. We'll go to the Eight.
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY Hey, wait a second. Wait a second. ! How about some champagne?
GEORGE Champagne?
JERRY Yes, come on! How often do you get engaged? Come on!
GEORGE Okay! Alright!
JERRY You know what? No champagne. . . . I'll see you later.
GEORGE Yeah.
ELAINE That's it. That's it. Stop right here.
NEWMAN All right, give me the rope.
ELAINE What? What do you need a rope for?
NEWMAN Look, I don't have time to explain every little thing to you.
ELAINE I don't know. Now, I'm thinking maybe we shouldn't do this.
NEWMAN I knew you'd back out.
ELAINE Kramer:, are we doing a bad thing?
KRAMER Well, Look at it this way. We drop the dog off in front of somebody's house in the country. They find it and adopt it. Now the dog is prancing in the fields. Dancing and prancing. Fresh air. . Dandelions. We're doing this dog a real favor.
ELAINE Yeah. That's him.
NEWMAN All right. I'm going in. Keep the motor running.
JERRY Ready?
GEORGE Um, I don't uh, really think I can go.
JERRY Oh, how come?
GEORGE Well, I didn't really tell Susan: about it, and she doesn't really have anything else to do.
JERRY Well, she could come.
GEORGE Well, she doesn't really want to see Firestorm.
JERRY Oh.
GEORGE She um, she wants to see The Muted Heart.
JERRY Oh, The Muted Heart. Glen Close. Sally Field. Well, that should be good.
GEORGE Yeah. see you later.
JERRY Hey, wait a second. You know, we could share a cab. They're playing at the same Cineplex.
SUSAN George, better get read
GEORGE I am ready.
SUSAN You wearing that shirt?.
GEORGE Okay, I guess I'll see you down there.
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE Okay.
ELAINE What time you got?
KRAMER Oh, no. I don't wear a watch.
ELAINE What do you do?
KRAMER Well, I tell time by the sun.
ELAINE How close do you get?
KRAMER Well, I can guess within an hour.
ELAINE Tsk. Well, I can guess within the hour, and I don't even have to look at the sun.
KRAMER Yeah.
ELAINE Well, what about at night? What do you do then?
KRAMER Well, night's tougher but it's only a couple of hours.
NEWMAN Let's go. Let's go. Move!
KRAMER You got it?
NEWMAN What do you think? Drive. Drive.
ELAINE Where is it? Where is it? This? This is the dog?
NEWMAN Yep.
ELAINE But he's so small.
NEWMAN Yeah, but he's a fighter.
ELAINE That can't be the dog. Are you sure you got the right one?
NEWMAN Look, you said the one in the second courtyard. He was in the second courtyard.
ELAINE How could that be the dog?
KRAMER Well, get him to bark.
ELAINE Yeah. Yeah. I'll know if he barks.
NEWMAN All right. Bark.
ELAINE Bark.
NEWMAN Bark.
SUSAN Did you like it?
GEORGE Yes, it was very, very good.
SUSAN Oh, do you think he'll ever find her again?
GEORGE Oh, I sure hope so.
JERRY How about when Harrison Ford jumped out of that plane, and he was shooting back at them as he was falling?
FRIEND What about that underwater escape?
JERRY Oh, man!
KRAMER Let's turn the radio on. Maybe there's a news report about it.
ELAINE You think we're far enough.
NEWMAN We're practically to Monticello.
KRAMER Yeah. This looks right. All right. Give me the dog. Okay, boy. This is it. This is your new home. Let go of my shirt. Come on. Let go of my shirt. This shirt is from Rudy's.
GEORGE Hello?
JERRY Hey, is rerunning the Yankee game. You watching this?
GEORGE They are?
SUSAN George:, you coming to bed? I'm taping mad About You.
GEORGE Uh, yeah, I'll be there in a minute.
JERRY What was that?
GEORGE Uh, nothing. I got to go.
JERRY Oh, Mattingly just singled .
GEORGE You know, it was really wrong of you to back out on that deal.
JERRY I didn't make a deal. I just shook your hand.
GEORGE Yeah, Well that's a deal where I come from.
JERRY We come from the same place.
SUSAN George:, I'm starting it.
GEORGE I got to go. Lady Roxy! Where have you been? We've been worried sick about you. What's this? Hmm. Rudy's.
ELAINE No! No! It's impossible. It's impossible.
ELAINE I don't know. I don't know how it happened. We were practically in Monticello. I mean, how could that thing have found its way back? There's no way.
JERRY Very strange.
ELAINE I know.
JERRY So, tell me anyway. Who was the big mastermind?
ELAINE Oh, I can't Jerry:. I'm sworn to secrecy.
JERRY All right. But then I can't tell you the big news.
ELAINE News? What news?
JERRY Sorry!
ELAINE What? What?
JERRY All right, Elaine but this is beyond news. This is like Pearl Harbor. Or the Kennedy assassination. It's like not even news. It's total shock.
ELAINE Oh, come on, Jerry:. Please, please, please, please, please!
JERRY George Costanza...
ELAINE Yeah?
JERRY Is getting married!
ELAINE Get out!
KRAMER Hi.
COP You Cosmo Kramer?
KRAMER Uh, yes. Yeah.
COP You recognize this piece of fabric?
KRAMER Oh, yeah, that's
COP What?
KRAMER What?
COP You're under arrest.
KRAMER Arrest?
COP I have a receipt for a rental car with your signature. Including a report with some damage to the rear seat. It seems the spring was so compressed it completely collapsed the right side..
NEWMAN What took you so long?
KRAMER Hey, what do you think they'll do to us?
NEWMAN Ah, don't worry about a thing. In twenty minutes that place'll be swarming with mailmen. We'll be back on the street by lunch.
ELAINE I gotta make some changes. I'm not a woman. I'm a child. What kind of life is this?
JERRY I don't know about you, but I'm getting sick of pretending to be excited every time it's somebody's birthday, you know what I mean? What is the big deal? How many times do we have to celebrate that someone was born? Every year, over and over... All you did was not die for twelve months. That's all you've done, as far as I can tell. Now those astrology things where they tell you all the people that have the same birthday as you? It's always an odd group of people too, isn't it? It's like Ed Asner, Elijah Muhammed and Secretariat.
ALLISON I don't want to live! I don't want to live!
GEORGE Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldn't want to live because of me? I'm nothing!
ALLISON No... You're something.
GEORGE You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me. I'm no good!
ALLISON You're good. You're good!
GEORGE I'm bad. I'm bad!
ALLISON You're killing me!
GEORGE So what could I do? I couldn't go through with it. She threatened to kill herself.
ELAINE Over you?
GEORGE Yes. Why, is that so inconceivable?
GEORGE I got two tickets to see "Guys And Dolls".
ELAINE I got him a two-line phone.
JERRY Unbelievable! She's not there.
GEORGE What paper does she write for?
JERRY The works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student in journalism. Never been to a comedy club. Never even seen me, has no idea who I am.
ELAINE Never even seen you? Gotta kinda envy that...
JERRY Y'know, you've been developing quite the acid-tongue lately...
ELAINE Really?
ELAINE Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?
JERRY Living or all time?
ELAINE All time.
JERRY Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev.
ELAINE I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?
GEORGE Lyndon Johnson was uglier than Degaulle.
ELAINE I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up a tree.
ELAINE Y'know, just because you two are homosexuals, so what? I mean you should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already.
GEORGE So, whaddya say? You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love.
JERRY What's the matter with you?
GEORGE C'mon, go along...
JERRY I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose stepping past me. "C'mon Jerry, go along, go along..."
JERRY Y'know I hear that all the time.
ELAINE Hear what?
JERRY That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.
ELAINE Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too.
JERRY Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat.
ELAINE And you get along well with women.
GEORGE I guess that leaves me in the clear...
GEORGE I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become a porno actor.
JERRY Oh yeah, what? "Buck Naked"?
GEORGE Yeah, how did you know that?
JERRY You told me that already like two months ago.
GEORGE Allison bought it for me.
JERRY How you gonna get out of that one?
GEORGE I dunno. I guess I have to wait for her to die.
JERRY He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?
SHARON Sure, I'd like to talk to him, too.
GEORGE Jerry did you wash this pear?
JERRY Yeah, I washed it.
GEORGE It looks like it hasn't been washed.
JERRY So wash it.
GEORGE You hear the way he talks to me?
SHARON You should hear how my boyfriend talks to me...
GEORGE Let me ask you something. What do you think of this shirt?
SHARON It's nice.
GEORGE Jerry said he didn't like it.
JERRY I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was O.K...
GEORGE No, you said you didn't like it...
JERRY Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that like the end of the world, or something?
SHARON So how did you two meet?
JERRY Actually, we met in the gym locker room.
GEORGE Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb the ropes and Jerry was spotting me. I kept slipping and burning my thighs and then finally I slipped and fell on Jerry's head. We've been close ever since.
SHARON Do you guys live together?
JERRY Live together?
GEORGE No, I got my own place.
SHARON And do your parents know?
JERRY Know what?
GEORGE My parents? They don't know what's goin' on...
JERRY Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us. I knew you looked familiar!
JERRY There's been a big misunderstanding here! We did that whole thing for your benefit. We knew you were eavesdropping. That's why my friend said all that. It was on purpose! We're not gay! Not that there's anything wrong with that...
GEORGE No, of course not...
JERRY I mean that's fine if that's who you are...
GEORGE Absolutely...
JERRY I mean I have many gay friends...
GEORGE My father is gay...
SHARON Look, I know what I heard.
JERRY It was a joke...
GEORGE Look, you wanna have sex right now? Do want to have sex with me right now? Let's go! C'mon, let's go baby! C'mon!
KRAMER Hey, C'mon! Let's go! I thought we were going to take a steam!
GEORGE No!
JERRY No steam!
KRAMER Well I don't want to sit there naked all by myself!
KRAMER Happy birthday paruba!
JERRY Today's not my birthday.
KRAMER Well, I beg to differ...
JERRY Look at this! A phone! A two-line phone!
JERRY Hey, where you going?
ELAINE I gotta go return something...
SHARON Jerry, it's Sharon from NYU. I'm just calling to tell you that I'm not going to play up that angle we talked about and I'm sorry.
JERRY Thank you very much, that's great- clickclick click I guess we fooled her. I'll get rid of her, hold on... Sharon? Hello? Sharon, are you there? I'm back...
GEORGE Y'know... I could hear you on the other line...
JERRY What are you talkin' about?
GEORGE I heard what you said: "Sharon, are you there?".
JERRY You heard me talkin' on the other line, are you sure?
GEORGE Yes, I heard you!
JERRY Well, maybe she was disconnected.
GEORGE Maybe she wasn't! Maybe she heard the whole conversation!
JERRY Alright, hang on. Let me call Kramer and see if you can hear anything, hold on.
KRAMER Yello?
JERRY Kramer, there may be a problem with the phone, hold on. click click Ma?
MRS._SEINFELD Jerry?
JERRY Ma!
GEORGE Oh, my God! My MOTHER!!!
MRS._SEINFELD Jerry?
JERRY Ma, it's not true!
MR._SEINFELD It's those damn culottes you made him wear when he was five!
MRS._SEINFELD They weren't culottes, they were shorts.
MR._SEINFELD They were culottes! You bought them in the girl's department.
MRS._SEINFELD By mistake! By mistake, Jerry! I'm sorry!
MR._SEINFELD It looked like he was wearing a skirt, for crying out loud!
JERRY Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes!
MRS._SEINFELD Not that there's anything wrong with that, Jerry.
MRS._COSTANZA I open up the paper, and this is what I have to read about? I fell right off the toilet. My back went out again, I couldn't move... The super had to come and get help me up. I was half naked!
GEORGE It's not true!
MRS._COSTANZA Every day it's something else with you. I don't know anything about you any more. Who are you? What kind of life are you leading? Who knows what you're doing? Maybe you're making porno films.
GEORGE Yeah. I'm Buck Naked.
MRS._COSTANZA Jerry, I can see. He's so neat and thin. Not that there's anything wrong with it.
GEORGE Of course not...
NURSE 6:30, Scott. Time for your sponge bath.
GEORGE Alright, now the play is tomorrow night. So do you want to have dinner first, or do you just want to meet at the theatre?
SAILOR Excuse me, sir? I don't mean to bother you. I just wanted you to know that it took a lot of guts to come out the way you did, and that you've inspired me to do the same, even though that may mean a discharge from the service. Thanks.
JERRY Y'know, I think I'll pass on the "Guys And Dolls"...
GEORGE No. Just imagine her reaction.
ELAINE Yeah...
GEORGE Oh, my God...
JERRY What?
GEORGE She hasn't seen the article! When she sees it, she's gonna think-- I'm out baby!! I'm out!!!!!
ALLISON Yeah? So?
GEORGE Yeah so??
ALLISON Well this is nice. They mention your name.
GEORGE Don't you see what it says here? Don't you understand what that's implying?
ALLISON No, what?
GEORGE I'm gay! I'm a gay man! I'm very, very gay.
ALLISON You're gay?
GEORGE Extraordinarily gay. Steeped in gayness.
ALLISON I don't believe it.
GEORGE You don't believe me? Ask Jerry.
ALLISON I will.
GEORGE What do you mean you will? That's a bad idea. Jerry is a very private person.
ALLISON I want to hear it from Jerry...
SHARON Oh, can you ever forgive me?
JERRY I dunno... Alright, I forgive you...
SHARON Y'know the funny thing is, I was attracted to you immediately.
JERRY I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane.
GEORGE Jerry! Oh, my God! What are you doing!?!
JERRY What!?
GEORGE You're with a woman!
JERRY I know! What are you doin' here?!?
GEORGE I leave you alone for two seconds, and this is what you do! I trusted you!
JERRY Would you get the Hell out of here!
SHARON What's going on?
ALLISON Yeah, what's going on?
GEORGE Alright, tell her. Go ahead.
JERRY Tell her what?
GEORGE Y'know. About us.
GEORGE Alright, I'll tell you the truth. I'm not gay. My name's Buck Naked, I'm a porno actor.
ALLISON Really?
KRAMER We'll see you later...
KRAMER He's the phone man!
KRAMER Not that there's anything wrong with that...
JERRY I am not gay. I am, however, thin, single and neat. Sometimes when someone is thin, single and neat people assume they are gay because that is a stereotype. They normally don't think of gay people as fat, sloppy and married. Although I'm sure there are, I don't want to perpetuate the stereotype. I'm sure they are the minority though within the gay community. They're probably discriminated against because of that, people say to them "Y'know Joe, I enjoy being gay with you but I think think it's about time, y'know that you got in shape, tucked the shirt in and lost the wife". But if people are even going to assume that think Joe might be a little... ", they should vacuum "Y'know I think Joe might be . Yeah, I got a feeling he's a little"
JERRY Hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs? Pepcid AC, Tagemat HB.
ELAINE Ugh, the whole country's sick to their stomach.
JERRY Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get sick?
ELAINE What is this, a 'bit'?
JERRY No.
ELAINE 'Cos I'm not in the mood.
JERRY We're just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? If you feel good, you're supposed to take one!
ELAINE Yeah, I know that tone. This is a bit.
JERRY They've opened up a whole new market. Medication for the well.
ELAINE Alright, are you done with your little amusement?
JERRY Then you admit it was amusing?
ELAINE It was okay, but move the 'medication for the well' to the front, and hit the word 'good' harder.
JERRY Great. Thanks.
ELAINE So, your firm designed all the furniture in here?
BRETT We manufacture it. The original designs are by Karl Farbman.
ELAINE Oh, Farbman.
BRETT You know Farbman?
ELAINE Mm, love Farbman.
BRETT Most people go their whole lives without sitting in a Farbman.
ELAINE Wuh, if you call that living. Ahaha.
ELAINE Wouldn't it be great if Farbman designed shoes?
ELAINE Brett? Don't you think that would be great?
ELAINE Brett?
BRETT After the song, babe.
ELAINE Huh?
BRETT The song.
JERRY So when do I meet this jerk?
ELAINE He's not a jerk, Jer. He only works with Karl Farbman.
JERRY Who?
ELAINE I dunno, some designer. Anyway, Brett is so generous, and sensitive. Last night he was moved just listening to a song.
JERRY What song?
ELAINE Desperado.
JERRY Desperado?
ELAINE Uh huh.
JERRY And you're still dating him? I tell you who sounds a little desperado.
JERRY See that salesman, twirling that umbrella.
ELAINE Uh huh.
JERRY I invented that.
ELAINE That, had to be invented?
JERRY When I started out as a comedian, I sold umbrellas. It was my idea to twirl it, to attract customers.
ELAINE Oh hoh, really? Well, why don't we ask him about it?
JERRY Elaine.
ELAINE Excuse me. Hey, how you doing. Uhm, my, uh, friend here says that he invented that little twirl you're doing.
JERRY Elaine, please, it was a long time ago. The man doesn't want a history lesson.
CLICKY Teddy Padillac came up with this twirl.
ELAINE Ohh.
JERRY I know Teddy Padillac. I worked with him on Forty-eighth and Sixth.
CLICKY Yeah, that's where he come up with it.
JERRY In his dreams.
ELAINE Alright, can we go?
JERRY By the way, you're doing it too fast. You'll disorient the customers.
JERRY It's the twirling that dazzles the eye.
GEORGE I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway? Y..you get 'em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans.
JERRY Those belong to people.
KRAMER Hey. Well. This was downstairs for you. Ker-ching.
JERRY Oh no, not more checks. They're coming faster than I can sign 'em.
GEORGE What checks?
KRAMER Oh, you didn't hear? Jerry's a big star in Japan.
JERRY I don't know why. There's a one-second clip of me in the opening credits of some Japanese comedy show.
KRAMER Yeah, the Super Terrific Happy Hour.
JERRY They run it all the time, and now I'm starting to get all these royalty checks.
GEORGE Look at all of those! You're rich!
JERRY Naw. Each one is for like twelve cents. It's barely worth the pain in my hand to sign 'em.
KRAMER Hey, Jerry, you need any new furniture?
JERRY Why?
KRAMER Yeah, well, Elaine's new boyfriend, you know. He's giving me this oversize chest of drawers. It's a Farbman.
GEORGE He's giving you furniture? Who is this guy?
JERRY Ah, who are any of her losers?
GEORGE You're on that list.
GEORGE Alright, I gotta go home and open up with the house for the carpet cleaners. You know they're doing my whole place for twenty-five dollars.
KRAMER Oh, no, no, no. Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
EGO Yeah, you heard of 'em?
KRAMER They're a crazy religious cult. The carpet cleaning is just a means for them to get into your apartment.
GEORGE So? For a twenty-five dollar cleaning, I can listen to some pointless blather.
JERRY I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning.
JERRY Signed over a hundred checks this morning.
KRAMER Hello, twelve dollars.
MR_OH Excuse me. Would you take picture please?
KRAMER Oh, yeah, sure.
JERRY I'm gonna ask this guy something.
JERRY Hey. Nice twirl you got there. You know who invented that, don't you?
KRAMER Hey, are you folks from Japan.
MR_YAMAGUCHI Hai.
MR_OH Yes.
KRAMER You recognise that mug?
KRAMER That's the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the Super Terrific Happy Hour.
MR_OH Ahh, Super Terrific Happy...
KRAMER Ah, yeah. Yeah, that's him.
MR_OH What is he doing?
KRAMER Well, I don't know. But something super terrific, I'm sure.
MR_OH He's funny.
KRAMER Oh yeah, very funny. And it wouldn't be impolite to laugh at his antics.
KRAMER Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Because everybody laughs at Jerry here in America.
CREW_LEADER We're pretty much finished.
CREW_LEADER There's just one more thing.
GEORGE Here it comes.
CREW_LEADER You forgot to sign your check.
GEORGE Sorry. You're sure, uh, there isn't anything else?
CREW_LEADER No.
GEORGE So, that's it?
CREW_LEADER Unless you need a receipt.
GEORGE I wish that was all needed. Life can be so confusing. I..I'm searching for answers, anywhere.
CREW_LEADER Good luck with that.
JERRY Hey.
ELAINE What's with the claw?
JERRY Super terrific carpal tunnel syndrome.
BRETT There's no sign of Kramer.
ELAINE Oh, Brett. This is Jerry.
JERRY Hi.
BRETT That's very funny. Elaine told me you were some kinda comedian.
JERRY Ah, I'm one kind.
ELAINE Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer?
JERRY The Fleckman.
BRETT Farbman.
JERRY Right.
ELAINE You gotta see 'em. Beautiful.
JERRY Oh, I'm sure they are.
BRETT I'd be happy to get you some if that's what you're driving at.
JERRY No. I'm fine, thank you.
BRETT Don't worry. It's no charge to you.
BRETT Looks like what you really need is a decent desk for writing your skits.
JERRY I don't write skits.
BRETT Well, of course you don't. You don't have a proper workstation. I'll fax you over my catalogue.
ELAINE Mmm. Brett, uhm, Jerry doesn't have a fax machine.
BRETT Oops.
BRETT Well, I'm sure things'll pick up for you soon. Elaine, maybe we should get going.
ELAINE Oh. Jerry, you wanna join us?
JERRY Oh, where you going? The coffee shop?
BRETT Coffee shop? I think we can do a little better than that. You look like you could use a solid meal at a real restaurant.
JERRY You look like you could use a...
ELAINE Jerry.
KRAMER Three hundred dollars. Hey, Mr Oh, how much would these run you in Tokyo?
MR_OH Ahh, about, uh, thirty thousand yen.
KRAMER Thirty thousand?! These are practically free.
KRAMER Giddyup. You're a cowboy now.
BRETT I feel terrible about your friend Jerry. He's upset that I gave Kramer that chest of drawers, isn't he?
ELAINE Why? Why d'you think he's upset?
BRETT How could he not be? Living in that cramped little apartment. And outdated furniture, so terribly... un-Karl Farbman-like.
ELAINE We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, are we?
BRETT I hope not.
ELAINE Brett? Everything alright?
ELAINE Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside?
BRETT Elaine, the song.
ELAINE Oh. Oh, oh, phew. You know, for a minute there I thought it was like that urban legend about the guy with the hook who's hanging on the fender...
BRETT Elaine, could you just not talk for one minute?
ELAINE Sorry.
JERRY No spiel?
GEORGE Not a peep. They just cleaned the carpets and left. Call themselves a cult!
JERRY So you're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to abduct you?
GEORGE They could've at least tried!
JERRY You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed?
GEORGE Please.
JERRY Too dumb?
JERRY Well! Mack is back in town! Nice duds.
KRAMER Konichi-wa. Yeah, it's a gift from my Japanese friends. They're known as gift-givers. And tonight we're going dancing at the Rainbow Room.
JERRY Sounds like you're throwing a lot of their money around.
KRAMER Well, Jerry, they're Japanese. I mean, that TV you watch, that sushi you eat, I mean, even that kimono you wear. Where to you think all that money goes, hmm?
KRAMER That's right.
GEORGE How'd you hook up with these guys?
KRAMER Well, they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. See now, you should be doing your own show in Japan. Now, they get you.
JERRY What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan?
KRAMER Alright, what'd you do with that pilot you did.
GEORGE Yeah, the pilot!
KRAMER That's right, I think that had marvellous production values.
GEORGE And, you know, I do a lotta business with Japanese TV. They broadcast a lot of American baseball. They got an office here in New York!
JERRY Forget it! The pilot was awful. It failed.
GEORGE It failed here! Because, here, every time you turn on a TV, all you see is four morons sitting round an apartment, whining about their dates!
KRAMER George is right, Jerry. See, here, you're just another apple, but in Japan, you're an exotic fruit. Like an orange. Which is rare there.
TV_JERRY You had a date? You went out with my butler?! Who said you could go out with my butler?!
TV_ELAINE Well, why do I need your permission?
TV_JERRY Because he's my butler.
GEORGE So? What d'you think?
EXECUTIVE_1 We're bit confused. Why was this man Jerry's butler?
GEORGE Ah. You see, the man who was the butler, uh, had gotten into a car accident with Jerry, and because he didn't have any insurance, the judge decreed that the man become Jerry's butler.
EXECUTIVE_1 Is this customary in your legal system?
JERRY No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation.
EXECUTIVE_1 Are you following any of this?
EXECUTIVE_2 I'm still trying to figure out why they gave us a bag of oranges.
EXECUTIVE_1 I'm sorry. I'm sure Mr Seinfeld is very funny to Americans, but I'm not sure this butler show would work in Japan.
GEORGE Oh, I, uh, I disagree. You've, uh, you've been living in America too long. You've forgotten what it's like to have no oranges.
EXECUTIVE_1 Again with the oranges
JERRY Sorry. My hand is numb.
GEORGE Yes. From endorsing checks for the Super Terrific Happy Hour.
EXECUTIVE_1 You must go now.
ELAINE Ah, I think I'm on the outs with Brett. I got shushed during Desperado.
JERRY What does he listen to? The all Desperado station?
ELAINE He is just in his own world when he hears that song. It's like, I'm sitting there in the car, and he's.. out riding fences.
JERRY You know, what you need is a song you can share.
ELAINE Yes. You're right. We need to find 'our' song.
JERRY Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly about?
ELAINE I like Witchy Woman.
JERRY Witchy Woman?
ELAINE You know, Witchy Woman. 'Ooo-ooh, wit-chay woman'.
JERRY Ahh. Wit-chay Woman.
KRAMER Hey, man.
ELAINE Hey.
JERRY Hey. How was the Rainbow Room?
KRAMER Uh, well, we, uh, we had to leave early. There was a, uh, slight monetary discrepancy regarding the bill.
JERRY Ah.
KRAMER Uh, listen, uh, can I borrow some pillows?
JERRY What for? Kramer wanders into Jerry's bedroom.
KRAMER Yeah, well, uh, my Japanese friends're gonna stay with me.
JERRY I thought they all had suites at the Plaza?
KRAMER Well, I'm sorry, Jerry, we all don't have checks rolling in like you do.
JERRY Well, what about all that money from the kimonos I wear?
KRAMER Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with fifty thousand yen.
ELAINE Fifty thousand yen? Isn't that only a few hundred dollars?
KRAMER Evidently. Oh, by the way, tell Brett that his chest of drawers are a big hit. My guests are very comfortable in them.
ELAINE In them?!
JERRY You have them sleeping in drawers?!
KRAMER Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in tiny stacked cubicles all the time. They feel right at home.
JERRY This has 'international incident' written all over it.
KRAMER Oh yeah, yeah.
KRAMER Goodnight, Mr Tanaka.
MR_TANAKA Goodnight.
KRAMER Goodnight, Mr Oh.
MR_OH Goodnight.
KRAMER Goodnight, Mr Yamaguchi.
MR_YAMAGUCHI Oh, yes. Goodnight.
JERRY What is this?
KRAMER Rice Crispies. East meets West, Jerry.
JERRY Ah. It's a lovely little bureau and breakfast you're running. Well, I'm off to the bank.
KRAMER Sayonara.
JERRY Konichi-wa.
BRETT Elaine, I...
ELAINE Shh-shh! What d'you think?
ELAINE What are you doing? That's Witchy Woman. That could be our song.
BRETT Witchy Woman is okay for you, but I've already got a song.
ELAINE Oh. Oh, then how about Desperado? We can share it.
BRETT No. It's mine.
KRAMER Here you go. Snap, crackle and pop.
KRAMER Good morning, Mr Oh. I gotta make up the drawer.
MR_OH Ach, come back in half hour.
JERRY Hey, I'll take one.
CLICKY Well, look who's back!
CLICKY Teddy! This's the guy says he invented the twirl.
TEDDY Jerry Seinfeld!
JERRY Teddy Padillac. Long time, no see. What've you got in a push-button mini.
TEDDY Same thing we had, when you bailed on us, fifteen years ago.
JERRY Bailed? C'mon, you knew I wanted to be a comedian. Besides, we had some good time. Remember Tropical Storm Renee?
TEDDY Oh, yeah, sure. But where were you during the poncho craze of eighty-four? I almost lost my house.
CLICKY Umbrella, buddy? Now we got that damn 'urban sombrero' to contend with.
TEDDY Easy, there. I hear you're taking credit for the twirl.
JERRY Aw, it was so many years ago. Who cares?
TEDDY I care. Clicky cares.
JERRY So, could I...
JERRY Could I just buy an umbrella?
TEDDY Yeah, sure. Two hundred dollars.
JERRY What?!
TEDDY Special price, for a real foul-weather friend.
KRAMER Hey, George. How about that tour, huh? These guys are ready to run the bases.
GEORGE Kramer, it's, it's raining. They got the tarp on the field.
KRAMER Ah, listen, George, what else can I do with these guys? Now, bear in mind, they're a little light on the yen.
GEORGE Well, I, I got the pilot of the Jerry show.
KRAMER That's perfect. Hey, how would you guys like to watch Super Terrific Happy star Jerry Seinfeld?
MR_OH But, we are also very hungry.
KRAMER Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, you guys just watch the tape and, uh, I'll get you some food.
KRAMER Hey, peanuts!
WILHELM George. George.
WILHELM Uh, George, uh, did you call some carpet cleaners?
GEORGE Are they here?
WILHELM They're in my office, right now.
GEORGE They haven't said anything to you, have they?
WILHELM About what?
GEORGE What kind of a snobby, stuck-up, cult is this?!
BRETT Hey Jerry!
JERRY Oh, hi Brett.
BRETT Haven't you ever heard of an umbrella?
JERRY Ah, I didn't have enough money.
BRETT I'm sure things'll pick up for you.
JERRY No, it's not that, it's the...
JERRY Oh no, look at the checks! Hours of hard work ruined!
BRETT Ah, don't worry, I can spot you the twelve cents?
JERRY No, it's not the money. It's my hand. It's crippled from writing and writing.
BRETT Nothing's working for you, is is?
JERRY Not at the moment, Brett.
BRETT I'd give you a ride, but I got Karl Farbman here.
JERRY Thanks for stopping!
ELAINE Brett said you ran away from him, as if he were the boogetyman.
JERRY Boogeyman.
ELAINE Boogey?
JERRY I'm quite sure. Anyway, any luck getting together on a song?
ELAINE No. He blew out my Witchy Woman, and he won't share Desperado. Hey, what d'you think of Oye Como Va?
JERRY Eehh.
ELAINE Well, I'm running outta guys here in this city, Jer!
JERRY Hey.
GEORGE Great news! I showed the pilot to Kramer's Japanese friends. They loved it!
JERRY Really? They bought the butler character?
GEORGE Did I tell you that story's relatable?! That was a great show! That is why I'm bringing it back to NBC.
JERRY nbc?
GEORGE Nakahama Broadcast Corporation.
JERRY Ah. But they told us we must go now.
GEORGE But now I have my own market research. Actual Japanese viewers, that love the show! I'm gonna talk to Kramer.
JERRY Hey, George, do me a favour. If they make you an offer, whatever it is. Just take it!
GEORGE Hey, by the way, what'd you think of Miss Yoshimura?
JERRY Who?
GEORGE The network executive. You think she liked me?
KRAMER Heyy! Look who's here. The Japanese whoop and wave at George.
KRAMER Come on, I want you to come in here. All the Japanese gesture and shout that George should get in the tub with them.
MR_OH Come on in, fat boy! George waves away their appeals with a smile.
GEORGE Get a good night's sleep, alright fellas. Big day tomorrow!
JERRY Last one. Uugh! Ahh.
KRAMER There you are. George jumps, surprised by Kramer.
GEORGE Uh. Where's the boys?
KRAMER Uh, no, I let 'em sleep in.
KRAMER I'm on my way to cash in their plane tickets for them. They need a little food money.
GEORGE But that meeting starts in ten minutes!
KRAMER No, well, I set their alarm. But they did have a lot of sake in that hot-tub.
GEORGE I'm calling Jerry.
JERRY Yeah?
GEORGE Jerry! The Japanese guys had sake in the hot-tub! You gotta get 'em outta the drawers and get 'em down here, or I don't have a focus group to sell the pilot to Japanese TV!
JERRY Uncle Leo?
GEORGE Jerry!!
JERRY Alright, alright. I'll wake 'em up.
JERRY Hmm, testy.
JERRY Hello?
MR_OH Mr Jerry! Open the drawer, please!
JERRY It's stuck. Oww! The steam from the hot-tub musta warped the wood.
MR_OH Pull harder.
JERRY I'm trying. I can't get a grip. My hand's had kind of a bad week.
MR_OH Very funny, but no joking, please.
JERRY Don't worry, I'll get you out.
ELAINE Brett, believe me. You don't have to do this.
BRETT Elaine, I know he'll appreciate this. Granted, it's not as nice as Kramer's cabinet, but it's start.
ELAINE Uh, I promise you, Jerry is not jealous of Kramer's cabinet.
JERRY Move to the back of the drawers!
ELAINE Jerry?
ELAINE Jerry.
BRETT Not the Farbman!!
MR_OH Jerry Seinfeld is a dangerous lunatic. He wouldn't let us out of the drawers. Then he came at me with an axe.
EXECUTIVE_1 We suspect his friend here is also unbalanced.
GEORGE So, uh, gentlemen, do we have a deal?
MR_OH Could we have a couple of those oranges?
MR_OH We are very hungry and have survived many hardships.
GEORGE Excuse me. Did you hire the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
EXECUTIVE_1 Yes. Cleaned up the coffee stain, left by Jerry Seinfield.
GEORGE Mr Wilhelm? Wha..what're you doing here?
WILHELM I'm here to clean the carpets. Most of the world is carpeted. And, one day, we will do the cleaning.
GEORGE Him you brainwashed! What's he got that I don't have?!
GEORGE Mr Wilhelm, listen. You've been abducted! Please, Mr Wilhelm, you gotta listen to me!
WILHELM Wilhelm? My name is Tanya.
EXECUTIVE_1 With these two idiots I don't know how the Yankees won the World Series.
JERRY Brett, I'm, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hit you in the head with.. an axe.
JERRY At least it was just the handle!
BRETT It was a beautiful cabinet. What am I gonna tell...
BRETT I can't remember his name!
JERRY Fleckman?
ELAINE Calm down Brett, okay. You could have a concussion. Calm down. 'Desperado, mmm-mm-mmm. You better...' ELAINE/
JERRY '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you, before it's too...'
NURSE His pulse is fine.
DOCTOR Hmm. Looks like a minor concussion. Let me see what I can do to relieve the swelling.
NURSE Doctor?
NURSE Doctor?
NURSE Doctor?
NURSE Doctor, I think we're losing him!
JERRY You know at the movies, they show that little ad for the concession stand?
ELAINE Where the cartoon candy's dancing and the Milk Dud's playing the banjo?
JERRY He's wailing on that banjo.
ELAINE Yeah.
JERRY I just don't understand the raisinettes.
ELAINE The sax player?
JERRY Yeah.
ELAINE Yeah.
JERRY The box of raisinettes runs up to the concession stand, buys another box of raisinettes.
ELAINE So?
JERRY Box of raisinettes eating another box of raisinettes? It's perverse.
ELAINE He's not gonna eat them. He's buying 'em for his Pepsi girlfriend.
JERRY Why's he dating a Pepsi? They're not having children.
ELAINE He's a musician.
JERRY Musicians. Get a real job.
WAITRESS What d'you want?
GEORGE Ah, I've had everything on the menu. Uh, surprise me.
DANIELLE Neil.
DANIELLE Neil.
DANIELLE Oh, I am sorry. I'm supposed to meet my boyfriend here. He looks just like you.
GEORGE Really?
DANIELLE Yeah.
GEORGE Like me?
DANIELLE Uh-huh. Sorry.
GEORGE Like me? But how?
WAITRESS Here's your halibut omelette. Surprised?
GEORGE Yes, yes, I am.
KRAMER Look what I got for you, for your Florida trip. Crazy Shirts was closing 'em out. I got a dozen for a buck.
KRAMER Saved a fortune. Look at that. Heyy.
JERRY Ohh, 'Number 1 Dad'.
KRAMER Yeah.
JERRY Ooh, and it's in medium. Perfect.
KRAMER Hey.
GEORGE Hey.
JERRY Hey.
GEORGE Hey. You ready?
JERRY Almost.
KRAMER Okay, look, uh, when you're in Florida, can my cigar guy drop off some Cubans for me at your parents' house?
JERRY Kramer, I'm helping my parents move into their new condo. I'm gonna be busy.
KRAMER Aw, c'mon man. Help a brother out.
JERRY Alright.
KRAMER Yeahh. I owe you one.
JERRY We're even.
GEORGE Jerry, figure this out. I'm in the coffee shop, and this beautiful girl I could never even talk to, mistakes me for her boyfriend.
JERRY That's a nice four seconds.
GEORGE I look just like him. I. Me. This! This is what her boyfriend looks like. How is that possible?
JERRY Maybe he has money.
GEORGE Maybe he doesn't. Maybe he and I are exactly the same, except for one minor, yet crucial, detail. You never know.
JERRY Sometimes you do.
GEORGE Maybe it's some small thing I could change. Like a moustache. Or wearing a top hat, or a monocle, or a..or a cane.
JERRY Who's she dating? Mr Peanut?
GEORGE She could do a lot worse than Mr Peanut, my friend.
BLAINE So, what d'you wanna see?
ELAINE What about Sack Lunch?
BLAINE How about The English Patient? It's up for all those Oscars.
ELAINE Oh, c'mon Blaine. I mean, look at the poster for Sack Lunch.
BLAINE It's a family in a brown paper bag.
ELAINE Don't you wanna know how they got in there?
BLAINE No.
ELAINE Aww. Sold out.
BLAINE Oh, two for The English Patient.
ELAINE So d'you think they got shrunk down, or is it just a giant sack?
GEORGE Uh, hi. Uhm, remember me? I..I'm the guy who looks like Neil?
DANIELLE Hi.
GEORGE Huh-Hi. Uhm, is Neil here?
DANIELLE Oh, no. He got held up at work.
GEORGE Oh, that's too bad. I kinda wanted to meet him, seeing as how we look so similar.
DANIELLE Well, you know, you don't look that much like him.
GEORGE Oh. Course not.
DANIELLE No, you're a little taller.
DANIELLE You look like you're in better shape than Neil. Do you work out?
GEORGE Listen, I..I..I don't mean to seem forward...
GEORGE ...but is there any way that I could possibly have Neil's phone number?
ELAINE Why is everyone talking about "The English Patient, it's so romantic". God, that movie stunk!
BLAINE I kinda liked it.
ELAINE No you didn't.
CAROL Elaine. Elaine, did you just see The English Patient?
GAIL Didn't you love it?
LISA How could you not love that movie?
ELAINE How about, it sucked?
CAROL That Ralph Fiennes, I would give up my firstborn for him.
ELAINE Huhh, getting the short end of that stick.
MORTY Jerry, this is Del Boca Vista's new physical fitness room. They got medicine balls, you can bike ride, anything you want.
JERRY Stairmaster?
MORTY What?
JERRY Nothin'.
MORTY See what I'm wearing?
JERRY Oh, did you get that outta my bag?
MORTY No, your mother found it. Son, this is the most wonderful and thoughtful thing you've ever done for me.
JERRY You know, I bought you a Cadillac. Twice.
MORTY Hoh, here he is. This is the man I wanted you to see. Izzy Mandelbaum. He's eighty years old, but strong as an ox. Watch this.
MORTY See that? You couldn't do that.
JERRY I could, but I choose not to.
SID Hey Morty. Who's this?
MORTY This is my son Jerry, from New York. He thinks he can lift more than Izzy.
JERRY I..I didn't say that.
SID Hey, Izzy, this kid says he can lift more than you can.
IZZY Your kid's pretty funny, Morty. Should be a comedian.
JERRY Actually, I am a comedian.
SID That's not so funny.
IZZY Think you're better than me, huh?
MORTY Izzy used to work out with Charles Atlas in the fifties.
JERRY Eighteen-fifties?
IZZY Yeah, that's it. It's go time. Let's see you lift that.
JERRY Mr Mandelbaum, I...
IZZY C'mon, c'mon. Pump it!
JERRY Alright.
IZZY Yeah, wrong attitude. you're not bringing that trash into my house.
JERRY There. Alright?
IZZY Step aside, stringbean.
IZZY I'll show you. We're gonna take it up a notch.
IZZY Ah! My back. Ugh.
IZZY Aaaahh.
SID Somebody, call an ambulance.
MORTY There's already an ambulance here for Mrs Glickman. There's room for one more.
ELAINE Okay, one for Sack Lunch. It's good, right? Yeah, good.
ELAINE Hey, what're you guys doing here?
LISA We just saw The English Patient again.
GAIL It's even better the second time.
ELAINE They make it longer?
BLAINE Got my umbrella.
ELAINE Blaine!?
BLAINE Elaine.
ELAINE I thought you were busy tonight.
BLAINE Well, to tell you the truth Elaine. I don't know if I can be with someone who doesn't like The English Patient.
ELAINE It's just a stupid movie.
BLAINE That's what I'm talking about.
CAROL Come on, Blaine. Let's go.
BLAINE Enjoy Sack Lunch!
ELAINE I will!
HELEN How could you do that to Mr Mandelbaum? You should be ashamed of yourself.
JERRY He egged me on.
HELEN You should be more mature.
JERRY He's eighty!
MORTY Okay. Tomorrow, Jerry and I will visit Izzy and apologise. Now, goodnight.
HELEN You're not sleeping in that shirt. It's too tight.
MORTY This shirt will never leave my body.
HELEN Goodnight.
JERRY Alright. Seven-thirty, got the place to myself.
GUILLERMO Jerry Seinfeld please.
JERRY Ah, you must be Kramer's guys. Come on in. You got the cigars?
GUILLERMO What cigars?
JERRY Kramer said I was supposed to bring him back some Cubans.
GUILLERMO We are the Cubans.
KRAMER Yeah, hello, Jerry's place.
JERRY They're real Cubans?! They're human beings, from Cuba?!
KRAMER I said Cubans. What'd you think I meant?
JERRY Cigars!
KRAMER Jerry, Cuban cigars are illegal in this country. That's why I got these guys.
JERRY You're making your own cigars now?
KRAMER Yeah, yeah. I got investors all lined up.
JERRY Hold on a second. Hiya dad.
MORTY Who are they?
JERRY They're Cuban cigar rollers.
MORTY Don't tell your mother.
JERRY What is that bubbling sound? Are you making your tomato sauce?
KRAMER Hot and spicy.
JERRY You're not wearing a shirt, are you?
KRAMER Yes I am.
JERRY What colour is it?
KRAMER Damn!
GEORGE You know, you could've just given me Neil's number. You..you didn't have to take me out to dinner.
DANIELLE I wanted to give it to you in person.
DANIELLE You know, I don't have to be up in the morning, and I know a great breakfast place, right around the corner.
GEORGE Does Neil like to eat a big breakfast?
DANIELLE Why don't you come in? We'll take about it.
GEORGE I really should get going. Y'know, I..I wanna be home in case Neil calls.
DANIELLE Well, goodnight.
GEORGE I'll see you.
WAITRESS Rough night?
ELAINE Ugh. You wouldn't believe it. My boyfriend dumped me. My friends, who I don't even like, they won't talk to me. All because I don't like that stupid English Patient movie.
WAITRESS Really? I thought it was pretty good.
ELAINE Oh, come on. Good? What was good about it? Those sex scenes! I mean, please! Gimme something I can use!
WAITRESS Well, I liked it.
ELAINE Hey. You forgot about my piece of pie. Hello? You know, sex in a tub. That doesn't work!
JERRY This is quite a condo.
MORTY The Mandelbaums own the Magic Pan restaurants.
JERRY The crepe place?
MORTY Yeah. This is all big crepe money.
JERRY There's crepe money?
IZZY What are you doing here?
JERRY Aw, Mr Mandelbaum, I just wanted to come by and tell you how sorry I was that you hurt yourself.
IZZY What the hell is that?
JERRY What?
IZZY That shirt. You think that you are the number one dad?
MORTY This was a gift from my son.
IZZY Oh, I see how it works now. He knocks me outta commission, so you can strut around in your fancy number one shirt. Well, I'll show you who's number one.
JERRY Mr Mandelbaum, please.
IZZY It's go time.
IZZY Ahh. My back. I can't move.
MORTY Call an ambulance.
JERRY I think I saw one a coupla doors down.
JERRY So she wanted you to come up, but you left because you thought some guy might be calling you?!
GEORGE Some guy. Some guy? Neil! I have got to find out how he could get a girl like Danielle.
JERRY George, you've got Danielle. Forget about Neil. You've out-Neiled him.
GEORGE So, I'm Neil? How did I do that?
JERRY I don't know, but you better keep it up.
GEORGE I'm gonna go meet Danielle. There's a new Neil in town! Hahaha!
JERRY I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole operation's a shambles. Hello.
MORTY Hey Jerry. Number One here. Did you go see Izzy at the back specialist?
JERRY I will, I just walked in the door.
HELEN You have to go see him.
JERRY Ma.
MORTY Helen, will you stop bothering him.
HELEN Jerry, that shirt is gone right to his head.
MORTY Number One, signing off.
KRAMER Jerry, I just picked up the Cubans at the bus station. What's going on!?
JERRY What?
KRAMER They're not real Cubans. They're Dominicans.
JERRY So?
KRAMER So, Jerry, if my investors don't get Cubans, the whole deal's off.
JERRY What's the difference?
KRAMER Jerry, once you've had real Cubans, there's just nothing else like it.
JERRY We're talking about people, right?
KRAMER Yes, yes. The quality, the texture, the intoxicating aroma. These guys don't have it.
JERRY I thought they smelled pretty nice.
KRAMER Jerry, your palate's unrefined.
JERRY Is not.
KRAMER Is too.
JERRY Is not.
KRAMER Is too.
JERRY I'm not having this conversation.
KRAMER Are too.
JERRY Am not.
KRAMER Are too.
JERRY Am not.
KRAMER Are too.
PETERMAN Another productive meeting. By the way, I saw that English Patient film last night. It was extraordinary.
DUGAN Oh yes. It was so romantic. It ravished me.
PETERMAN Elaine, what'd you think?
ELAINE Well, uh, act..actually, I haven't seen it. So, I couldn't tell you whether I liked it, or whether it really sucked.
PETERMAN You haven't seen it?
ELAINE No.
PETERMAN That's it! Drop everything. We're going right now.
JERRY Again, Mr Mandelbaum, this back specialist is supposed to be the best. So if there's anything else I can do, please don't hesitate to, uh, try and find my number.
IZZY Uh, oh, wait.
IZZY How 'bout that, huh? The World's Greatest Dad. My son made it for me.
JERRY That's very nice.
IZZY The best in the world. Which means I'm better than just number one.
JERRY Well, I don't know how official any of these rankings really are.
IZZY Hi, son.
IZZY_JR Hi daddy.
JERRY This is your son?
IZZY I got married in high school.
IZZY_JR Hey, who are you?
IZZY This is Seinfeld's kid.
IZZY_JR Oh, you think you're tough, picking on an old man? Maybe you'd like to try taking on somebody your own age.
JERRY You got any kids?
IZZY_JR Oh, you think you're better than me? Go ahead, pick out anything in the room here. I'll lift it up over my head.
JERRY Look, no-one is lifting anything.
IZZY The television.
JERRY Oh no.
IZZY_JR This one's for you, Pop. It's go time. Ohh! My back!
IZZY Call an ambulance.
JERRY We're already in a hospital.
HAFFLER Awright, partner. Let's get down to business.
KRAMER Okay, well, uh, I'll uh, I'll get the Cubans.
KRAMER They're right out here.
KRAMER Hey, here they are. The Cubans. Real Cubans.
HAFFLER You wouldn't be trying to sell old Earl Haffler Dominicans in a Cuban wrapper now, would you?
KRAMER Oh, now, come on. Look at these boys. If they were any more Cuban, Castro would've smoked them himself. Huh.
HAFFLER We're talking about people, right?
KRAMER I think so.
HAFFLER I thought he quit smoking cigars.
KRAMER Well, yeah, yeah. But they also rolled for his brother... ...Dennis.
HAFFLER Dennis Castro?
KRAMER Uh, Dwayne.
HAFFLER Get the hell outta my office.
KRAMER What!?
DANIELLE You know, Neil called me today.
GEORGE Really?
DANIELLE Yeah. He's pretty upset that I broke up with him to go out with you.
GEORGE Ah, I guess I showed Neil who's Neil.
DANIELLE He wants to get together tomorrow night and have coffee.
GEORGE Coffee? I can beat that. Move in with me.
DANIELLE What?
GEORGE Beats the hell out of coffee.
PETERMAN And I thought I knew what love was.
ELAINE Yuh.
JERRY You asked her to move in with you?
GEORGE I gotta stay one step ahead of Neil.
JERRY What if it's Neil Armstrong?
GEORGE Then I'm going to Mars!
JERRY What if it's Neil Diamond?
GEORGE Aw, shut up Jerry! Just shut up!
JERRY Alright, I gotta go back to the hospital.
GEORGE What, to see the old guy?
JERRY No, I got into a thing with the son, and now he's laid up too.
GEORGE How old's the son?
JERRY I think he's the same age as the father.
GEORGE What is with this family?
JERRY I dunno. It's like, if one of 'em dies, the other one wants to bench press the casket.
KRAMER Hey, Jerry.
KRAMER Datiditadit.
JERRY You're cold?
KRAMER No. Ditadidatidat.
JERRY Something wrong with your chest?
KRAMER Dijadidatjd. There.
JERRY Where?
KRAMER No, no. Don't look. Don't look.
KRAMER Over there. The Dominicans.
JERRY Aren't they supposed to be rolling cigars?
KRAMER Well, it didn't quite work out, and now I've got nothing for them to do.
GEORGE So?
KRAMER So, I taught 'em all about Cuba, and they really took to it. You know, Marxism, the Worker's Revolution, the clothing.
JERRY Boy, they seem pretty angry about something.
KRAMER Yeah. I'm a little worried. When there's no work, and the people get restless, who do you think they come after? El Presidente!
JERRY I swear to you, I didn't know they
TV was bolted to the table.
IZZY_JR I bet you pulled that trick on my daddy, in Florida.
JERRY He couldn't handle the weight.
IZZY Oh, so now you think you're better than me?
IZZY_JR You think you're better than him?!
JERRY Look, let me just state for the record, I think you're both better than me.
IZZY Okay.
IZZY_SR My boys.
IZZY My dad.
IZZY_JR My grandpa.
JERRY Oh, come on!
IZZY_SR What happened to him?
JERRY He was trying to lift the TV.
IZZY_SR That TV? Izzy Sr. strides purposefully toward the TV.
JERRY Oh no. It's go time.
IZZY_SR Oohh!
IZZY_SR Why didn't anybody tell me? It was bolted down!
IZZY I still thought you could do it.
IZZY_JR Me too. Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...
JERRY Fellas, fellas, look, I gotta go.
IZZY Oh yeah, that's right. Go. Put us all in the hospital. And you've ruined our business with all your macho head games.
JERRY I didn't ruin your business.
IZZY Yes, you did. There's nobody there now at the Magic Pan to roll the crepes. We gotta close it up.
JERRY Don't you hire people to do that?
IZZY Each crepe has to be hand-rolled by a Mandelbaum. That's what puts the magic in Magic Pan!
JERRY So, you just need some guys that could roll 'em?
IZZY Yeah.
JERRY I think I can help you out. I'll see you later.
IZZY_SR Hey, I can't see the TV.
JERRY Here.
IZZY You think you're better than us,don't you?! Huh!?
PETERMAN Elaine, I hope you're watching the clothes, because I can't take my eyes off the passion.
ELAINE Oh. No. I can't do this any more. I can't. It's too long. Quit telling your stupid story, about the stupid desert, and just die already! Die!!
PETERMAN Elaine. You don't like the movie?
ELAINE I hate it!!
CROWD Shh!
ELAINE Oh, go to hell!!
PETERMAN Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? You're fired.
ELAINE Great. I'll wait for you outside.
JERRY He was gonna fire you?
ELAINE The only way I could talk him out of it was that I agreed to go and visit the Tunisian desert.
JERRY Tunisia?
ELAINE That's where they filmed the movie. It's supposed to inspire me.
JERRY Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
ELAINE I have to live in a cave.
JERRY Oh.
KRAMER These Dominicans really know their way round a crepe. Look at that. It's like they're rolling a double corona.
KRAMER Just a cigar made outta bisquik, huh, Guillermo?
DANIELLE I'm very happy with George. I'm sorry Neil, it's over.
DANIELLE Come on, let's just eat our crepes.
CUSTOMER Aaghh!! My face!
DANIELLE Neil!
JERRY Why are the crepes spraying?
KRAMER The Dominicans are rolling them too tight. Uhm, well, that's why you gotta get real Cubans.
GEORGE Danielle. Where's Neil? Is this him?
DANIELLE Yeah, that blueberry crepe burned him pretty badly.
GEORGE Whose cane is this?
DANIELLE It's Neil's.
GEORGE A cane. I knew it. So, we meet at last. I admire your skills, Mr Peanut.
GEORGE Well, Danielle, we should get going. I got a key made for you.
DANIELLE George, I can't move in with you.
GEORGE What?
DANIELLE I'm sorry, but I'm taking Neil to a clinic in England.
GEORGE N..no, no. You can't leave me. Marry me! I'll burn myself. I'll burn my parents!
DANIELLE Sorry George.
NEIL George.
NEIL I win.
TAN Ladies and gentlemen. In just one moment, we'll be showing our feature presentation...
ELAINE No, no, no, no, no.
TAN ...the comedy hit, Sack Lunch, starring Dabney Coleman.
ELAINE Ah, right! Aw, this is shaping up.
GUY Excuse me, please.
ELAINE Oh, sure.
ELAINE Ooh.
GUILLERMO Ladies and gentlemen. Because we have been exploited by your Magic Pan crepe restaurants...we are hijacking this plane to Cuba!
GUILLERMO Everyone stay in your seats. And shut that movie off!
ELAINE Aww, nuts!
JERRY Are you sure you can't stay longer?
MORTY No, we just came for the funeral. `
HELEN Poor Marvin Kessler, he went too early.
JERRY He was 96 years old.
MORTY That had nothing to do with it, the man was out of shape.
HELEN That's why we joined a program. We walk once around the block three times a week.
MORTY And every morning I eat a plum.
JERRY Well, what ever you do, you're wearing me out.
HELEN What about you?
MORTY Yeah, looks like you're getting a little spare tire there, tiger.
JERRY Really?
KRAMER Hey, Seinfelds!
MORTY Hey, Mr. Kramer!
KRAMER How long are you staying?
HELEN We just came down for a funeral.
KRAMER Oh yeah, yeah I heard, Marvin Kessler. Boy, that makes you think. If he could go...
HELEN See you downstairs with the car.
JERRY Are you sure you don't need a hand with that?
MORTY No no, the luggage is on the program. I got a brick in here.
JERRY Did you give blood?
KRAMER No, not giving. hoarding. I'm storing it in to a blood bank. Just in case.
JERRY In case of what?
KRAMER Jerry, I know myself. If I'm out on the street and it's starts to go down, I don't back off until it's finished.
JERRY Are we finished?
KRAMER Done.
VIVIAN Elaine, I'm so glad you came out.
ELAINE Yeah...
VIVIAN You haven't seen Jimmy for years.
ELAINE I know, I'm glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got, you know all lurchy and awkward.
VIVIAN Actually, I'm gonna need someone to look after him tomorrow evening.
ELAINE Tomorrow evening, sure.
VIVIAN Do you know anyone responsible?
ELAINE Do I know anyone??
VIVIAN Well, if you think of anybody, give me a call.
GEORGE What are you doing?
TARA Incense, for the mood.
GEORGE Oh yes, by no means, the mood. Let me know if there's anything I can do to lend support to the mood.
GEORGE Um, cream soda?
TARA Vanilla. -
ELAINE Can you believe that, Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible?
JERRY Who wants to responsible? When ever anything goes wrong, the first thing they ask is: who's responsible for this?
ELAINE I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around.
JERRY What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight?
GEORGE I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. We need some pudding here! Pudding!
ELAINE You just left? What did you tell her?
GEORGE I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another hour.
JERRY What?
GEORGE I don't know, I was starving Jerry!
GEORGE Oh, pudding! You want some?
JERRY Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky?
GEORGE What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it on the stove.
JERRY Elaine, what do you think?
ELAINE I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself. ----
KRAMER My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your hidden fees and your service charges. Well, maybe I'll just take my blood elsewhere, yeah.
BANK_EMPLOYEE Well, we can transfer to another bank for you.
KRAMER Oh, no no no...no more banks. I'm keeping my blood in my freezer with...my money!
GEORGE So eh, what do you say?
TARA I guess we could use some food in our lovemaking.
GEORGE Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce, your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey...
TARA Wait wait wait, pastrami on rye with mustard?
GEORGE Oh yeah yeah, don't you know they used pastrami in that movie 9� weeks? Remember the pastrami scene?
TARA No.
GEORGE Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked! ----
JERRY Didn't go for it, huh?
GEORGE No.
JERRY So, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured meats?
GEORGE She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's only natural to combine them.
JERRY Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man and a sandwich.
GEORGE Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral.
JERRY Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about satisfying one of somebody else's.
GEORGE Hey, speaking of which, I found a great way to separate the skin from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; Exacto knife.
JERRY I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification program. Keep all that kind of food away from me.
GEORGE Well, I guess these would be out of the question.
JERRY What the hell is that?
GEORGE Pudding skin singles. ---
KRAMER Hey buddy, I'm borrowing all your Tupperware.
JERRY Oh, why?
KRAMER I closed down my account at the blood bank.
JERRY What, it...it's here in the building?
KRAMER Right across the hall. What, you wanna go see?
JERRY No I don't! In fact, if even one corpuscles of that blood should find it's way across that hall I will freak out on you Kramer! Freak out.
KRAMER You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly.
ELAINE Hey, working out?
JERRY You know it and I ditched all my junk food.
KRAMER What the heck is going on here?
JERRY Sorry buddy, clean house. It's all health food.
KRAMER Well, I may have to take it, but I don't have to like it.
ELAINE Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other someone.
JERRY Is this about me?
ELAINE No.
JERRY Oh, then I lost interest.
ELAINE Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on...
KRAMER For me? Go...Yeah, what tonight? Yeah, I'll be there...Yeah later. Well, somebody's baby-sitting.
ELAINE You? I'm more responsible than you are!
KRAMER Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to fill my freezer with my own blood.
GEORGE Oh, Tara! -
KRAMER Hello, Vivian! Oh, this is a nice screen.
ELAINE Kramer...
KRAMER Don't take my money!
ELAINE It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here, I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid.
KRAMER No, I'm the baby-sitter.
ELAINE No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road.
VIVIAN Elaine? What are you doing here?
ELAINE Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help out... what's that, some raccoon or something...
VIVIAN Well, I guess this would be all right. Jimmy, you remember Elaine? She's gonna watch you tonight.
ELAINE Hi Jimmy. Ouch!
JERRY Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting at Vivian's.
KRAMER There was an incident.
JERRY Oh no, where's the blood? It's in here isn't it?
KRAMER Would you stop it.
JERRY What is this?
KRAMER It's Jell-O.
JERRY What about this? This is blood isn't it?!
KRAMER This is tomato juice, look...
JERRY Ooh, you're sick! You're sick!!
KRAMER Will you calm down. I took all my blood down to Newman's. He let me put it in his meat freezer.
JERRY Hey, what's going on? Who made pudding?
KRAMER Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and made more of those pudding skin singles. They're delicious.
JERRY Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here anymore...
KRAMER Heads up!
JERRY Aaah... ----
JIMMY You're dead, president Lincoln! You're dead!
ELAINE I wish I was dead.
JIMMY Can I have your juice?
ELAINE As long as you don't put...
ELAINE Thanks for the re-fill.
VIVIAN Hey, Elaine! How did it go?
ELAINE Oh, he's...he's a joy...
VIVIAN Really? Some sitter have told me he's bit of a handful.
ELAINE Oh, handful of sunshine. I wish I could do this every day.
VIVIAN Oh Elaine, that's so good to hear. I've been having a few health problems lately.
ELAINE It's not serious, is it?
VIVIAN Well, it might be. Just in case anything does happen, it's nice to know there's somebody like you around.
ELAINE Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know.
JERRY Aah!
KRAMER It's ok, Jerry. I'm right here.
JERRY I can see that! What happened?
KRAMER That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up.
JERRY I'll remember that.
KRAMER Anyway, you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood.
JERRY What?
KRAMER Oh yeah, you've got three pints of Kramer in you, buddy.
GEORGE Three pints of Kramer's blood?
JERRY I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood.
GEORGE Well, so much for purification week.
JERRY So, how's the fornicating gourmet?
GEORGE Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that would really be the ultimate.
JERRY George, we're trying to have a civilization here.
ELAINE Hey.
JERRY Hey, how was baby-sitting?
ELAINE Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy.
JERRY Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst.
ELAINE It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world.
GEORGE She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on a baby-sitting gig.
JERRY Really?
KRAMER Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. It's all bramble, see it's like thicket back there. Look, I need somebody to shave it for me, huh?
JERRY I'm not touching that thing.
KRAMER Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed - blood brother.
JERRY Oh, no...
KRAMER What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse, hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy...
JERRY Kramer, I'm not shaving your neck.
KRAMER So, my blood is not enough. Would you like a kidney too, because I'll give it to you? I'll rip it out right here and stack it on the table!
JERRY All right, all right I'll do it, sit down.
KRAMER No no no, I don't have time right now. I'll catch you tonight, we'll do sort of an all over kind of thing, all right?
JERRY Hello?
HELEN Kramer called, he told that you were in a hospital.
JERRY Kramer called you?
HELEN He calls every week. Are you all right?
JERRY Yes, I'm fine.
HELEN He says he's fine.
MORTY Tell him to eat a plum.
HELEN Jerry, you really have to take better care of yourself. We bought you some session with a personal trainer.
JERRY I don't need a personal trainer. all right I've got to go, we'll talk about this later.
MORTY Plum...
JERRY Why are you calling my parents?
KRAMER Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to. Listen, is it all right if I watch a tape in here?
JERRY Why here?
KRAMER Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on C-Span.
JERRY Ok...
KRAMER Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed is really nice?
JERRY Fine...
KRAMER Ok!
JERRY No no no no no no no no no no! I do not want that in here!
KRAMER Blood!
JERRY All right.
IZZY Hello, dough boy.
JERRY Mr. Mandelbaum? You're the personal trainer?
IZZY I'm here to whip you in to shape, so grab your jocks - if you need one. It's go-time.
VIVIAN Elaine? Elaine?
ELAINE Oh, hi, oh God. I didn't here you come in.
VIVIAN Where's Jimmy?
ELAINE I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you I'm no good watching that kid.
VIVIAN Sleeping like an angel. Elaine, you're the best.
ELAINE No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job or keep a man!
VIVIAN Be quiet. So, will you watch Jimmy tomorrow?
ELAINE All right, but I'm running out of purses here.
JERRY Ok Mr. Mandelbaum, what you want me to do?
IZZY Drop your purse, and pick up that medicine ball.
JERRY Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum?
IZZY Not funny, over your head with it. Are you ready?
JERRY For what?
IZZY All aboard in the pain train!
JERRY How many session did my parents paid for?
IZZY Not enough to make a man of you, daffodil.
GEORGE Oohoho...spicy mustard...woohoho, you're hot tonight!
TARA Oh, George!
GEORGE And now for the trifecta.
TARA George? George? What are you doing?!
GEORGE Pleasuring you? - Manana. Jerry comes in.
JERRY What is this?
KRAMER We're making sausages.
JERRY I thought you were gonna watch a video.
KRAMER Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages.
JERRY Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this.
KRAMER All right, all right. Newman, let's go grab some mail sacks and haul these beauties out of here.
JERRY Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter house.
IZZY Tonight I want you to sleep on this. Toughens the vertebrae. What in holy hell? Sausages? Is this your diet?
JERRY No they're not mine Mr. Mandelbaum...
IZZY Don't lie to me, butter bean. We're taking it up a notch.
JERRY So, the free love buffet is over?
GEORGE I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami.
JERRY Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo.
JERRY What's going on?
GEORGE I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush.
JERRY Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge.
GEORGE I think you're right. You gonna eat that?
JERRY No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it.
ELAINE Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major inconvenience.
GEORGE These fries are really really good...
JERRY All right, that's enough of that.
ELAINE I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to Jimmy's birthday party.
GEORGE Uuh, sleepy.
ELAINE No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid.
JERRY Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you.
ELAINE Yeah, that's what I need; a pinch weasel.
KRAMER Why did you get rid of that sausage?
JERRY It wasn't me, it was Mr. Mandelbaum.
KRAMER Yeah well, Newman's not happy, he booted me out of his freezer. Look, I've got to take my blood back to the bank, can I borrow your car?
JERRY What's wrong with yours?
KRAMER I got no A/C and I gotta keep the blood cold or it'll go bad.
JERRY All right, but this is it, this is the last favor, we're even!
KRAMER All right, Even Steven. Oh, by the way, when you get back to your apartment try to keep it down because Newman is taking a nap in your bed.
KRAMER Oh, man... "If the engine begins to overheat, turn off air conditioner". Never, I can't do that.
KRAMER Oh, mama...
KRAMER Shees, come on.....this thing is bone dry.
ELAINE Vivian...
VIVIAN Elaine!
ELAINE Hi! This is my friend George.
VIVIAN Hi...
ELAINE I'm gonna go say hi to Jimmy.
VIVIAN Ok.
VIVIAN Oh, isn't Elaine fantastic?
GEORGE Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be seeing much more of her.
VIVIAN Really, why?
GEORGE Oh, you haven't heard, she's going to live with her grandparents in Redding Pennsylvania.
VIVIAN Her grandparent passed away five years ago.
GEORGE Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to Scotland.
VIVIAN She's American citizen, I have seen her passport.
GEORGE All right, no more lies. Elaine is been chosen to represent the Upper West Side in the next Biosphere project.
VIVIAN I haven't heard anything about another Biosphere.
GEORGE That's because it's underwater.
VIVIAN This is insane.
GEORGE Is it?
VIVIAN Yes it it.
GEORGE Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference.
VIVIAN You...very knowledgeable.
GEORGE Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami?
VIVIAN Yes it is. I find the pastrami to be the most sensual of all the salted cured meats. Hungry?
GEORGE Very.
VIVIAN Oh, wait... Oohh...
GEORGE Vivian!!
JERRY Is this really necessary?
IZZY If you wanna live in a butcher shop, I'm gonna treat you like a piece of meat.
JERRY What if I can't keep up?
IZZY You lie, you dry. Fire it up, son. IZZY JR. Right dad, Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...
IZZY_AND_IZZY_JR Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...
IZZY Move it, move it! Get those knees up! Come on, kick it, kick it!
JERRY What's going on? IZZY JR. There's something wrong with your car. It's dripping something on my feet. Some kind of red liquid.
JERRY Oh my God, the blood! IZZY JR. Blood!!
IZZY Get up boy, get up! We got a problem here! Tough it up. This is for real, you've got to want it... ...
ELAINE So how long did they drag you?
JERRY Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just doggin' it.
ELAINE Hi George. Hi Jimmy.
GEORGE Yeah, Jimmy why don't you wait outside, you know, play with something.
GEORGE Ouch!
JERRY What's the kid doing here?
GEORGE I'm baby-sitting! Vivian asked me to raise him if she doesn't make it.
JERRY Oh, that's a drag...
KRAMER That kid...
JERRY You put blood in the car?!
KRAMER Jerry, it was overheating. You should take better care of that thing.
JERRY Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you again.
KRAMER You didn't get the blood from me.
JERRY Then who?
NEWMAN Hello Jerry.
JERRY Aaaaahhh...!!!
JERRY_AND_KRAMER Aaaahhh...!!!
JERRY To me, the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. Are we gonna have to have AA-type meetings for these people? They'll go: "Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing I'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream-colored couch." According to most studies, people's number-one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. Death is number two! Now, this means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.
KRAMER Why can't I play Kramer?
JERRY Look we've been through this already. You're not an actor!
KRAMER Neither are you.
JERRY I know. So why do we need two people in the show that can't act?
KRAMER Oh come on Jerry. How hard is it to act. You say something, I'll pretend it's funny.
JERRY My grandmother's in the hospital.
KRAMER Ha ha ha. Your grandmother's in the hospital!
JERRY This is real believable.
KRAMER What you didn't think I was really laughing?
JERRY It stinks.
KRAMER Let me see you do it.
JERRY Say something funny.
KRAMER Alright. I've never been to Mars but I imagine it's quite lovely.
JERRY Ah..........
KRAMER Mine was better than that! Come on look.
GEORGE Why are two pretending to be laughing?
JERRY We're acting.
GEORGE Oh, real good. Any word from NBC?
JERRY No.
GEORGE I don't understand. They're supposed to be casting this week. Something's wrong. Maybe they're not doing it.
KRAMER Well at least let me audition.
JERRY He wants to play Kramer in the Pilot.
KRAMER Yeah!
GEORGE Out of the question.
KRAMER Oughh!
GEORGE How could we not hear anything? What's with this Russel? What's he doing?
RUSSELL I really appreciate you coming.
ELAINE Oh, that's O.K. I don't have much time though. So...
RUSSELL All right, first of all, I want to apologize for all the phone calls. It's just--It's just-- I don't understand, we went out once...
ELAINE That was two months ago.
RUSSELL Yes I know. I just-- I can't get you out of my mind. Ever since that-- that day in the restaurant when we met...
ELAINE Russell, you are the president of NBC. You can have any woman you want.
RUSSELL But I want you.
ELAINE God I hate these mixtures. Why don't they just put pretzels on the table. Even peanuts would be good, but I don't know how eats these cheesy things .
RUSSELL Is it something I said... or did?
ELAINE Um... Look Russell... You're a very sweet guy. But I got to be honest with you. I don't like television... and that's your world. That's your life. I mean maybe if you were in... I don't know... Greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television... I mean, come on, Russell, you're part of the problem.
RUSSELL Oh Elaine, we're doing some really very interesting things right now. We've got some very exciting pilots for next season. We have one with a bright young comedian, Jerry Seinfeld.
ELAINE Oh yeah, oh yeah. I've heard of him. He's that "Did you ever notice this? Did you ever notice that?" guy.
RUSSELL Yeah. Anyway it's a ground breaking show.
ELAINE Really? What is it about?
RUSSELL Well, really, it's very unusual. It's about nothing.
ELAINE What do you mean it's about nothing?
RUSSELL For example, what did you do today?
ELAINE Um, I got up. Um, I went to work. Then I came here.
RUSSELL There's a show. that's a show.
ELAINE Russell, see, I'm really not interested in this stuff and I do have to go to work . So...
RUSSELL Elaine, When--when--when are we gonna see each other again.
ELAINE I'm sorry Russell. I'm sorry O.K.? Bye-bye. .
JERRY Hello? Yeah he's here. Hey! It's for you.
GEORGE He's getting phone calls here now?
JERRY Again with the sweat pants?
GEORGE What? I'm comfortable.
JERRY You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweat pants? You're telling the world: "I give up. I can't compete in normal society. I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable."
KRAMER Hold on a second I got another call. Hello? Yeah, he'll call you back.
JERRY Who is it?
KRAMER That's NBC.
JERRY NBC!?! Give me the phone!
KRAMER I'm in the middle of a conversation here.
JERRY Get off the phone!
KRAMER Look, I'll call you back.
JERRY You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?
KRAMER Russell Dalrimple's secretary.
JERRY All right. Now you're doing something to help me. Hello yeah it's Jerry Seinfeld returning the call. Uh-huh.. O.K. great thanks a lot. Casting tomorrow at NBC. 4:00. We're in business baby, the pilot's on. You're gonna successful.
GEORGE What if the pilot gets picked up and it becomes a series?
DANA That'd be wonderful George, you'll be rich and successful.
GEORGE Yeah, that's exactly what I'm worried about. God would never let me be successful. He'd kill me first. He'd never let me be happy.
DANA I thought you didn't believe in God?
GEORGE I do for the bad things.
DANA Do you hear what you're saying? God isn't out to get you George. What... What is that on your lip?
GEORGE What?
DANA It's like a discoloration. It's white.
GEORGE Yes. Yes, it's white. Why it's white.
DANA You'd better get that checked out.
GEORGE Better get that checked out?
DANA I would.
GEORGE What kind of a therapist are you? I'm telling I'm scared that something terrible is gonna happen to me, right away you start looking for tumors?
DANA I'm trying to help you.
GEORGE What are you like a sadist? No matter how bad somebody feels, you can make 'em feel worse. I bet you're rooting for a tumor.
DANA I think you'd better go.
GEORGE Oh I'm going baby! I'm going!
JERRY Where?
GEORGE Right here.
JERRY Get out of here, it's nothing.
GEORGE Excuse me, do you see anything on my lip here?
CABBIE Yeah, it's like a discoloration.
GEORGE Oh, my God.
CABBIE Yeah, it's all white.
GEORGE It's all white Jerry! It's all white!
JERRY Would you stop?
CABBIE I would get that checked out if I were you.
GEORGE Again with the checked out. I'm not going to the doctor. If I don't to the doctor, then nothing will happen to me. If I go he might find something.
JERRY If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time.
GEORGE Catch what in time?
JERRY Whatever it is.
GEORGE You think it's something?
CABBIE Ah! I hate these bums with their filthy rags. No no no, I don't want it, get away, get away from my car
JOE_DEVOLA Good luck on the pilot Jerry.
STU Yeah I think I see it. It's like a white discoloration.
GEORGE What do you think it is?
JAY It's like a... white discoloration.
CASTING_DIRECTOR O.K. guys, are we ready to start?
JERRY Yeah, where is Russell? I thought he was gonna be here.
STU Oh you know I don't know. I saw him in the hall this morning, I said hello to him. He walked right past me.
JAY He must be worried about the fall schedule.
STU Ah, it's a real bear.
GEORGE Yeah. So what's going on? We're gonna shoot the pilot and then it's gonna be on TV the following week?
STU Yeah. Right.
CASTING_DIRECTOR This is Mark Matts. He'll be auditioning for the role of George.
MARK Hey how you doing?
JERRY They've gotta be kidding.
GEORGE This guy's perfect.
CASTING_DIRECTOR O.K. Let's read this. I'll be reading Jerry's part.
MARK Anyone call for Vandelay Industries?
CASTING_DIRECTOR No. Why?
MARK Listen to me. I told the unemployment office I was close to a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when you answer the phone now, you've got to say: "Vandelay Industries".
CASTING_DIRECTOR I'm Vandelay Industries?
MARK Right.
CASTING_DIRECTOR What is that?
MARK You're in latex.
CASTING_DIRECTOR What do I do with latex?
MARK I don't know, you manufacture it.
CASTING_DIRECTOR This is Michael Barth. Another George.
ALL Hi Michael. How you doing?
JERRY Everything all right?
MICHAEL I just came from the podiatrist. I have a mole on my foot. I've got a little gangrene, they're probably gonna have to amputate.
CASTING_DIRECTOR Any questions?
MICHAEL Yeah. What are we looking at here? Is this guy like a real loser?
GEORGE No, not a loser!
CASTING_DIRECTOR Let's start with the second scene. You have it here?
MICHAEL A man gave me a, you know, massage.
CASTING_DIRECTOR So?
MICHAEL Well, he-- he had his hands, you know, and uh, he was, huh, ...
CASTING_DIRECTOR He was what?
MICHAEL He was you know... he was touching and rubbing.
CASTING_DIRECTOR That's a massage.
MICHAEL I think it moved.
CASTING_DIRECTOR This is Melissa Shannon.
MELISSA Hi.
ALL Hi. How you doing.
CASTING_DIRECTOR Melissa is reading for Elaine.
MELISSA It's like a bald convention out there! Sorry. I, uh, made a faux pas.
JERRY No you didn't. He knows he's bald.
MELISSA So how about that guy wearing sweat pants? I mean did he do that for the part or does he walk around like that?
CASTING_DIRECTOR O.K. Shall we start?
JERRY Uh, you know what? I'll read with her.
MELISSA Oh, great.
JERRY Alright, want to start?
MELISSA Yeah.
JERRY O.K.
MELISSA Ahem. What was that look?
JERRY What look?
MELISSA That look you just gave me?
JERRY I gave a look?
MELISSA Yes.
GEORGE Thank you! Thank you very much.
CASTING_DIRECTOR Let's see some more Kramers.
ALL Hi. How you doing?
TOM How you doing?
JERRY Good.
CASTING_DIRECTOR What is this about?
TOM Levels.
CASTING_DIRECTOR Levels?
TOM Yeah. I'm getting rid of all, all my furniture. All of it! I'm building... levels... with steps... completely carpeted... with pillows. Like Ancient Egypt.
CASTING_DIRECTOR I don't know how you're gonna be comfortable like that?
TOM Oh! I'll be comfortable.
GEORGE Very nice
JERRY Very good
GEORGE Very nice Tom, that was terrific.
TOM May I?
GEORGE Sure. Thank you for coming in.
JERRY It was a wonderful reading.
GEORGE Yeah. Really.
TOM Well, bye.
GEORGE Take care. Take it easy.
STU Now, I thought he was really good, very funny.
JERRY Yeah, I liked him.
GEORGE What happened to the raisins?
JAY Yeah, there was a box of raisins there!
GEORGE Did he just steal the raisins?
STU You think he stole them?
CASTING_DIRECTOR This is Martin Van Nostrand.
JERRY What are you doing here?
CASTING_DIRECTOR You two know each other?
STU Wait a minute, I know you. You're the guy from the Calvin Klein underwear ads.
KRAMER That's true.
KRAMER I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time, I went in. Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom?
STU I think if you go down the hall, it's on the right at the very end.
KRAMER Yeah. Be right back. "Sorry buddy, full house." We then see Kramer outside leaving the building and running across the street to a restaurant: "Sorry, customers only" ...running into a movie theater: "Hey you need a ticket!" ...running through the park...
ELAINE So who's playing Elaine?
JERRY Oh, don't worry about it. Very talented, very takented young actress.
ELAINE Really?
JERRY Yes.
ELAINE Who is it?
JERRY She's an eskimo, actually.
ELAINE Oh, my God
JERRY She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.
ELAINE Listen, was Russell at the casting?
JERRY No, he didn't show up.
ELAINE You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?
JERRY No. No you're not.
ELAINE Why do I keep setting you up?
JERRY I don't know.
ELAINE Could we get a little more? Aghh... You know ever since this new owner took over, the service here is really slow.
JERRY Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?
ELAINE Mmm. They're putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that.
JERRY Beside that. Look at the waitresses.
ELAINE Yeah?
JERRY What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?
ELAINE Ah...
JERRY I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldn't you say?
ELAINE Yes, I would say.
JERRY What's going on here. How is that possible?
ELAINE Do you think it's a coincidence?
JERRY No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.
ELAINE Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the hiring waitresses here?
WAITRESS He does. In fact we're looking for another girl if you know anyone.
ELAINE You know what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?
JERRY Hey that's life. Good-looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome homeless.
GEORGE You see, It's right here. It's all white...
DOCTOR Oh yeah. Yeah. I've never seen this before.
GEORGE You've never seen this before?
DOCTOR I'm gonna have to take a biopsy on that.
GEORGE A what?
DOCTOR A biopsy.
GEORGE A biopsy?
DOCTOR Yeah.
GEORGE Cancer? Is it cancer? Do I have cancer?
DOCTOR Well I don't know what it is.
GEORGE A biopsy!
JERRY What did he say?
GEORGE He said he didn't know what it was.
JERRY Alright. So?
GEORGE When I asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a "get outta here". That's what I wanted to hear: "Cancer? Get outta here?"
JERRY Well, maybe he doesn't have a "get outta here" kind of personality.
GEORGE How could you be a doctor and not say "get outta here"? It should be part of the training at medical school: "Cancer? Get outta here!" "Go home! What are you crazy? It's a little test. It's nothing. You're a real nut. You know that?" I told you that God would never let me be successful. I never should've written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit, we'll make millions of dollars, and I'll be dead. Dead Jerry. Because of this.
JERRY Can't you at least die with a little dignity?
GEORGE No I can't. I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should I die with dignity?
JERRY Hey. What happened to you yesterday?
KRAMER I got mugged.
GEORGE You got mugged?
JERRY Mugged?
KRAMER Well, I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom.
JERRY Why didn't you use the bathroom in the building?
KRAMER It was full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me and...
JERRY Yeah?
ELAINE It's me.
JERRY Come on up.
KRAMER But now I have a big problem, buddy.
JERRY What is it?
KRAMER Well, I waited so long I-- I missed my chance.
JERRY You didn't go?
KRAMER No. And now I can't get it back.
KRAMER How could you not think about it?
ELAINE Hey.
KRAMER 
ELAINE What's the matter with him?
JERRY He's a little backed up.
ELAINE Oh...
GEORGE Elaine.
ELAINE So I spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop.
JERRY Oh, the sisters
GEORGE Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee in my life.
ELAINE So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.
GEORGE Apply for a job? What for?
ELAINE Because, it's discriminatory
GEORGE It's a coincidence.
JERRY This is what you gonna wear?
ELAINE Yeah.
JERRY You're not gonna get the job.
ELAINE Exactly.
JERRY Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah I guess we could do that. At what time? All right. I'll see you there. O.K., bye.
ELAINE Who was it?
JERRY TV Elaine. She wants to get together and talk about the part.
ELAINE What about the dogs?
JERRY They're having sex in the hotel room. Sandi Robbins
SANDI So, the Elaine character is based on someone you know.
JERRY Yes.
SANDI And she's really your ex-girlfriend?
JERRY Uh, Huh, yeah.
SANDI I want to get to know her from the inside. What is she like? Tell me about her.
JERRY Well, she's fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, banlon, and seeing people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she's extremely dainty.
SANDI How would she eat a hamburger?
JERRY With her hands.
SANDI What about pasta?
JERRY Also with her hands.
SANDI Seriously... I want to experience everything she's experienced.
JERRY Everything?
SANDI Everything.
JERRY All right she cuts her pasta with a knife.
SANDI That's good. What's her favorite movie?
JERRY Shaft.
SANDI You got to get me a picture. What about sex?
JERRY She likes talking during sex.
SANDI Oh... dirty talking?
JERRY No. Just chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. You know Sandi--
SANDI Elaine.
JERRY What?
SANDI Call me Elaine.
JERRY All right. Elaine.
SANDI How does Elaine kiss?
JERRY Well--
SANDI Does she kiss... like this?
JERRY Actually she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around, it's like--
SANDI Like this?
JERRY I think you got it.
TOM I'll have a hamburger. That's it.
KRAMER Yeah, that's good. Oh, now I like to play golf.
TOM This stuff doesn't matter to me. See, I'm gonna do the character like me, not like you.
KRAMER You gotta play him like me. I'm Karmer.
TOM I'm Kramer.
KRAMER Whoa, I'm Kramer.
MR._VISAKI What can I do for you? Would you like a table.
ELAINE No, I'd like to apply for a waitress job.
MR._VISAKI Have you ever waited on tables before.
ELAINE Oh yeah. I've been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. I've worked all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find that I'm more than qualified.
MR._VISAKI I don't think I need anyone else right now.
ELAINE You're in big trouble mister. And I mean trouble with a capital 'T'.
MR._VISAKI What? What did I do?
ELAINE Anyway there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie.
FRED Who's Russ Meyer?
ELAINE Oh, he's this guy who made these terrible movies in the 70's with these kinds of women. He's obsessed. He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to say.
FRED Anyway, go on.
ELAINE Um... Well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses, and I went in to apply for the job. And, he looked me up and down and he rejected me.
FRED Paul. Come in for a second. I want you to listen to this.
PAUL Hi.
ELAINE Hi.
FRED Paul, woman here claims there's a restaurant on the West side that's only hiring large-breasted women.
PAUL Really?JERRY I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking them out of my closet. I can't stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. I think eventually fashion won't even exist. It won't. I think eventually we'll all be wearing the same thing. 'Cause anytime I see a movie or a TV show where there's people from the future of another planet, they're all wearing the same thing. Somehow they decided "This is going to be our outfit. One-piece silver jumpsuit, V-stripe, and boots. That's it." We should come up for an outfit for earth. An earth outfit. We should vote on it. Candidates propose different outfits, no speeches. They walk out, twirl, walk off. We just sit in the audience and go, "That was nice. I could wear that."
JERRY I think I've seen enough.
SALESMAN Well, I might have something in the back.
ELAINE The back? They never find anything in the back. If they had anything good in the back, they'd put it out in the front.
JERRY Why don't they open up an entire store for the back? Call it, "Just Back." All back. No front. You walk in the front, you're immediately in the back. Look, Elaine, tie car wash.
CUSTOMER Oh, I just read that. That's terrific.
JERRY Her father wrote that.
CUSTOMER Alton Benes is your father?
ELAINE Yeah.
CUSTOMER I always felt he deserved a wider audience.
ELAINE I'm not so sure he wants one. Hey, don't forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury, eight o' clock.
JERRY ..I guess I'm coming.. I mean..
ELAINE What? What, you don't want to go now?
JERRY No, I'll go. I'm going.
ELAINE No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I haven't seen my father in a while and.. you know.
JERRY I'm worried I won't be able to talk to him. He's such a great writer. Frankly, I perfer the company of nitwits.
ELAINE So, that's why we're not togeter anymore.
JERRY What is this? This is beautiful.. but these jackets never fit me right.
ELAINE Try it on. Wow, this is soft suede.
JERRY This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on. How much is it?
ELAINE Oh my God.
JERRY Bad? ..Very bad?
ELAINE You have no idea.
JERRY I have some idea.
ELAINE No idea.
JERRY I've got a ballpark.
ELAINE There is no park and the team has relocated.
JERRY ..That is high.
ELAINE Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though.
JERRY What's with the pink lining and the candy stripes?
ELAINE Well, it's just a lining. You can always have it changed.
JERRY Should I get it? I hate these moments. I'm hearing the dual voices now, you know. "What about the money?" "What's money?"
SALESMAN It looks wonderful on you.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER Hey. New jacket?
JERRY What do you think?
KRAMER It's beautiful.
JERRY Is it me?
KRAMER That's definitely you.
JERRY Really?
KRAMER That's more you than you've ever been. What is with the pink lining?
JERRY I don't know. It's got a pink lining.
KRAMER Oh.. So, what did you pay for this?
JERRY I paid what it costs.
KRAMER How much?
JERRY What's the difference?
KRAMER What, you're not gonna tell me?
JERRY I'd rather not say it out loud. It's embarrassing.
KRAMER Over three hundred?
JERRY Yes, but let's just stop it right there.
KRAMER It's over four hundred?
JERRY Really, I'm not answering anymore.
KRAMER Is it over four hundred?
JERRY Would you?
KRAMER Woah, Nelson!
JERRY I know, I know.
KRAMER What are you gonna do with the leather one?
JERRY I don't know.
KRAMER Well, are you gonna wear it?
JERRY Maybe.
KRAMER You're not going to wear this.
JERRY Do you want it?
KRAMER Well, yeah. Okay. I'll take it.. I like the jacket.
JERRY ..Okay, take it.
KRAMER Good karma for you. Oh baby.
GEORGE "Master of the house.. doling out the charm, ready with a handshake and an open palm. Tells a saucy talke, loves to make a stir everyone appreciates a.."
JERRY What is that song?
GEORGE Oh, it's from Les Miserables. I went to see it last wee. I can't get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. It just comes out. I have no control over it. I'm singing it on elevators, buses. I sing it infront of clients. It's taking over my life.
JERRY You know, Schumann went mad from that.
GEORGE Artie Schumann? From Camp Hatchapee?
JERRY No, you idiot.
GEORGE What are you, Bud Abbott? What, are you calling my an idiot?
JERRY You don't know Rober Schumann? The composer?
GEORGE Oh, Schumann. Of course.
JERRY He went crazy from one note. He couldn't get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He had to be institutionalized.
GEORGE Really? ..Well, what if it doesn't stop? Oh, that I really needed to hear. That helps a lot! Alright, just say something. Just start talking. Change the subject.. Let's just go, alright? I can't believe we're having dinner with Alton Benes.
JERRY I know exactly what's goin to happen tonight. I'm gonna try and act like I'm not impressed, he's gonna see right through it.
GEORGE Yeah, he'll be looking at us like he's backstage at a puppet show.
JERRY Let me just get my jacket.
GEORGE "Master of the house, keeper of the inn.." This is huge! When did this happen?
JERRY Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this, it's with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I might've been a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet an social challenge.
GEORGE Can I say one thing to you? And I say this wiht an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality.
JERRY Absolutely.
GEORGE ..It's fabulous.
JERRY I know.
GEORGE And I'll tell you something else, I'm not even going to ask you. I want to know. But I'm not going to ask. You'll tell me when you feel comfortable.. So what was it? Four hundred? Five hundred? Did you pay five hundred for this? Over six? Can't be seven. Don't tell my you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket! Did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket? Is that what you're saying to me?! You are sick! Is that what you paid for this jacket?! Over seven hundred? What did you pay for this jacket? I won't say anything. I wanna know what you paid for this jacket! Oh my God! A thousand dollars?! You paid a thousand dollars for this jacket?! Alright, fine. I'm walking out of here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket, unless you tell me different. Oh, ho! Alright! I'll tell you what, if you don't say anything in the next five seconds, I'll know it was over a thousand..
KRAMER Hey. Hey, would you do me a solid?
JERRY Well, what kind of solid?
KRAMER I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while it's double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds.
JERRY Birds?
KRAMER Yeah. A friend of mine, he's a magician. He's going away on vacation. He asked me to take care of his doves.
JERRY So take a cab.
KRAMER They won't take a cage full of birds.
JERRY I can't. I'm on my way out. There's no way I can do it.
KRAMER George, do me a solid? Two minutes.
GEORGE Well, I'm going with him. I'd like to, I've never done a solid before.
KRAMER Alright.. yeah.. alright, have a good one.
JERRY Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes.. By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand years.
GEORGE "Master of the House. Quick to catch your eye, never wants a passerby to pass him by."
JERRY Schumann. Where are they?
GEORGE Maybe he didn't show up.
JERRY What, you don't want to do this?
GEORGE I don't think there's ever been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up.
GEORGE Wait a second, is that him?
JERRY Yeah, I think it is. Where's Elaine?
GEORGE I'm nervous.
JERRY Excuse me.. Mister Benes?
ALTON Yeah?
JERRY I'm Jerry. Elaine's friend.. and this is George.
GEORGE It's a great thrill to meet you, Sir.
ALTON Sit down. Want a drink?
JERRY Sure.
ALTON What do you have?
JERRY I'll have a cranberry juice with two limes.
GEORGE And, I'll have a club soda with no ice.
BENES I'll have another Scotch with plenty of ice.
GEORGE You like ice?
ALTON Huh?
GEORGE I said, do you like ice?
ALTON Like it?
GEORGE Don't you think you get more without it?
ALTON Where's Elaine?
JERRY Well, we thought she was meeting you earlier. She's usually pretty punctual. ..Don't you find that, George?
GEORGE Yeah, yeah. She's punctual.. and she's been late sometimes.
JERRY Yeah, yeah. Sometimes she's on time, and sometimes she's late.
GEORGE I guess today she's late.
JERRY It appears that way.
GEORGE Yep.
JERRY Yep.
ALTON Looks like rain.
GEORGE I know, I know, that's what they said.
ALTON Who said?
GEORGE The weather guy, Dr. Waldo.
ALTON I don't need anybody to tell me it's gonna rain.
GEORGE No, of course not. I didn't..
ALTON All I have to do is stick my head out the window. Which one's suppose to be the funny guy?
GEORGE Oh, he's the comedian.
JERRY I'm just a regular person.
GEORGE No, no. He's just being modest.
ALTON We had a funny guy with us in Korea. A tailgunner. They blew his brains out all over the Pacific. There's nothing funny about that.
JERRY Would you excuse me a minute? I'm gonna go to the bathroom. I'll be right back.
GEORGE I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game. I thought it was just brilliant.
ALTON Drivel.
GEORGE Maybe some parts.
ALTON What parts?
GEORGE The drivel parts.. Oh my gosh, I just realized - I have to make a phone call. I can believe.. would you..
GEORGE Thank you for leaving me alone with him!
JERRY That was brutal. I can't go back out there.
GEORGE Well, let's just leave.
JERRY Elaine'll kill me.
GEORGE Where is she?
JERRY She's gotta be here soon.
GEORGE How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more minutes, and that's it! I'm leaving. I have to tell you, this guy scares me.
JERRY The waiter was trembling.
GEORGE If she doesn't show up, we can't possibly have dinner with him alone.
JERRY How are we gonna get out of it?
GEORGE We'll say we're frightened and we have to go home.
JERRY Yeah, that's good. He'd clunk our heads together like Moe.
GEORGE I don't know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. He'll understand that.
JERRY All fathers are intimidating. They're intimidating because they are fathers. Once a man has children, for the rest of his life, his attitude is, "To hell with the world, I can make my own people. I'll eat whatever I want. I'll wear whatever I want, and I'll create whoever I want."
ALTON Who'd you call?
GEORGE My uncle is having an operation. I just wanted to see how he was.
ALTON What kind of operation?
GEORGE Bone marrow.
MANAGER Mister Benes?
ALTON Yes?
MANAGER A message for you.
ALTON From Elaine. She got tied up. She'll be here in thirty minutes.
ALTON Yeah, they should've taken care of Castro when they had the chance. Like we did in Guatamala in 'fifty-three.
JERRY Well, Guatamala.
GEORGE Sure, Guatamala.
ALTON Alright, you boys get yourselves together. We'll head up to the restaurant. I'll leave a note for Elaine. I'm going to the bathroom.
GEORGE Come on, let's go!
JERRY What about Elaine?
GEORGE To hell with Elaine!
JERRY She'll be furious.
GEORGE We're dying here!
JERRY That's her! She's here!
ELAINE I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Where is Dad?
GEORGE He's in the bathroom.
JERRY Where have you been?!
ELAINE Kramer, that .. Kramer! I'm just about to leave, he calls me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick up these birds..
JERRY Oh, you didn't..
ELAINE Well, he said he'd drive me here right after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! he doesn't come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells me to get out of the car. He's a city marshal. He's towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car! So, they tow the car. Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car.. so, finally, he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different diet. So, we're wandering around trying to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! Now we're running down the street after these doves. I almost got hit by a bus. ..So how's everything going over here?
JERRY Great.
GEORGE Couldn't be better.
ELAINE Good. 'Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable.
JERRY Oh, no, no.
GEORGE Get outta here..
ELAINE Man, Kramer! I could kill him.
JERRY I can't believe it. You know better than to get involved with Kramer.
ELAINE He said he'd give me a lift.
JERRY Ah, the lift. Like the lure of the siren's song. Never what it seems to be, yet who among us can resist?
GEORGE Where do you come up with this stuff?
ALTON Well, look who's here.
ELAINE Oh, Hi, Dad.
ALTON Hello, dear. Who's the lipstick for?
ELAINE No one.
ALTON ..How's your mother?
ELAINE Fine.
ALTON How about you? Are you working?
ELAINE Yeah, I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I told you ten times.
ALTON Pendant, those bastards.. Alright, boys. We'll go to that Pakistani restaurant on 46th Street. You're not afraid of a little spice, are you?
GEORGE "Master of the house, doling out the charm. Ready with a handshake and an open.."
ALTON Pipe down, chorus boy.
ELAINE Ohh.. it's snowing. It's beautiful.
JERRY Snow.. snow, that can't be good for suede, can it?
GEORGE I wouldn't think so.
JERRY What should I do? We're taking a cab, aren't we?
ALTON Cab? It's only five blocks.
GEORGE Why don't you just turn it inside out?
JERRY Inside out! Great.
ALTON Wait a minute. What the hell do you call this?
JERRY Oh, I turned my jacket inside out.
ALTON Well, you look like a damn fool!
JERRY Well, it's a new suede jacket. It might get ruined.
ALTON Well, you're not going to walk down the street with my and my daughter dressed like that! That's for damn sure!
GEORGE It's only a few blocks.
JERRY Elaine?
ELAINE Yeah.
JERRY Come on up.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER I've gotta feed the birds.
JERRY So?..
KRAMER You got any of those mini Ritzes?
JERRY I can't believe I do.
KRAMER Yeah! ..Well, are you going out?
JERRY Yeah.
KRAMER Hey, where's your new jacket? What? Ohhh. What did you do to it?
JERRY I was out in the snow last night.
KRAMER Don't youk now what that does to suede?
JERRY I have an idea. We can make the nine-thirty at Cinema III.
ELAINE Okay.. Hello. Listen, thanks again for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time.
JERRY Is he still in town?
ELAINE No, he's driving back to Maryland tonight.
KRAMER So, uh.. what are you gonna do with that one now?
JERRY I don't know.
KRAMER Well?..
ELAINE I didn't want to tell you this, but usually he hates everyone.
JERRY Really?
KRAMER You gonna throw this out?
JERRY Well, I can't wear it.
ELAINE Yeah, he like you though. Said you reminded him of somebody he knew in Korea.
KRAMER Well, if you're just gonna throw it out, you know, I could take it.
JERRY Yeah, go ahead, take it.
ELAINE Dad thinks George is gay.
JERRY Oh, because of all that singing?
ELAINE No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay.
KRAMER Hey, see, I like it like this.
ELAINE Isnt' that..? Oh, is this fromt he snow last night? Ugh.. you know what you should've done? You should've turned it inside out.
JERRY I'll try and remember that.
KRAMER Boy, it's too bad you gave me this one too.
JERRY Yeah, too bad.
KRAMER I'm gonna have to do something about this lining.
ALTON "Master of the house doling out the charm, ready with a handshake and an open palm.."
JERRY I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now, why does moisture ruin leather? I don't get this. Aren't cows ouside most of the time? I don't understand it. When it's raining do cows go up to the farmhouse, "Let us in, we're all wearing leather.. Open the door! We're gonna ruin the whole outfit here.." "Is it suede?" "I am suede, the whole thing is suede, I can't have this cleaned. It's all I got!"
JERRY I think that if the wedding invitations were left up to the men, we'd just drive around sticking flyers in windshields ...y' know... Not even typed up either, just Magic Marker, Zerox, you know...Party!!.. What's needed is a divorce announcement; Mr and Mrs Fred Johnson are requesting the honour of your presence at the "returning" of their daughter back to Mr,and Mrs Fred Johnson.
SUSAN Hi.
CLERK Hi.. May I help you?
SUSAN Yes, we'd like some wedding invitations.
CLERK Ohh! Well...Congratulations
SUSAN Thank you.
GEORGE yeah.. Thank you.
CLERK When 's the wedding?
SUSAN June
GEORGE late June.
CLERK Oh! Well, we have quite a few to pick from
GEORGE He..hmmm. humm...What about this one.
CLERK Hmmm,..to tell you the truth they haven't manufactured that one for a number of years. I might have couple of boxes left in our warehouse in New Jersey. I'd have to check.
SUSAN Oh! no. George that's so ugly we don't want that.
GEORGE What's the difference you just read it and mail it right back. These we'll do.
SUSAN Why don't they make'em anymore?
CLERK Well.. For one thing the glue isn't very adhesive. It takes a lot of moisture to make them stick.
GEORGE So we pick up some Elmers
SUSAN All right. You see what I do for you.
GEORGE Hey! Kramer.
KRAMER Hey! George.....Lily..
SUSAN No. Susan.
KRAMER No. No It's Lily
SUSAN I think I know my own name.
GEORGE It's Susan
KRAMER Well you look like a Lily...
GEORGE It's coming Jerry, it's coming.
JERRY What's coming?
GEORGE The Day..
JERRY Ahhh...The Day..
GEORGE We ordered the wedding invitations today,, Nothing can stop it now. Nothing. It's here! It's happening. Can I do this? I can't do this...Look at me. Look at me I can't do this, I can't do this Help me Jerry , help me.
JERRY why don't you just break it off with her. tell her it's over
GEORGE I can't
JERRY Why not? George; 'Cause I can't face that scene. You know what kind of scene that would be? i'd rather be unhappy for the rest of my life than go through something like that. I can't, I can't. I tried to psyche myself up a million times I cannot go through that.
JERRY All right take it easy, just take it easy.
GEORGE What about a letter?
JERRY A letter.
GEORGE I...I...write a letter and then I..I go to China. I disappear in a sea of people for like six months, a year you know just while things simmer down. Ehm.. Ehm...Dear Susan. I'm sorry. I made a terrible mistake. I'm really , really sorry.
JERRY That's it?
GEORGE What? Too short?
BOTH Seems a little short, yeah..
JERRY You can't go to China. What about your job?
GEORGE My Job..arghhh
JERRY So write a letter.. move to another...move to Staten Island., 'lot easier to blend in a sea of people in Staten Island than China believe me.
GEORGE Yeah! Yeah!..Staten Island . What about my clothes ,how do I get the rest of the clothes?
JERRY Aagh! You come back for your clothes
GEORGE I'm not going back in there.
JERRY So forget about your clothes.
GEORGE Well I'm not starting up a whole new wardrobe now!!!
JERRY Look, freedom with no clothes is a lot better than no freedom with clothes.
GEORGE If she'd just take a plane somewhere.
JERRY And what, hope for a crash?
GEORGE It happens.
JERRY You know what the odds are on a crash it's a million to one.
GEORGE It's something. It's hope.
ELAINE Hey!... Hey!! Georgie. You know what I just realized; the wedding is like a month away. ha..haa..
JERRY Euhh...Elaine....
ELAINE What?...Oh! by the way. What am I going to be in the wedding party?
GEORGE What do you mean?
ELAINE Well Jerry's gonna be the best man and Kramer's gonna be the usher so what am I gonna be?
GEORGE I don't know. I don't think you're anything.
ELAINE Wel...I have to be something. I 'm a close friend....What about being a bridesmaid.
GEORGE Those are Susan's friends.
ELAINE Well then...aaahh how about being an usher?
GEORGE Well...I'll ask Susan about it later.
ELAINE You don't ask.. You tell.
GEORGE What about the letter, should I think about the letter?
JERRY Hey Elaine if a guy wanted to end a relationship with you . What could he do?
ELAINE Start smoking.
GEORGE Smoking.
JERRY Does she hate cigarettes?
GEORGE Yes, she hates cigarettes.
JERRY But you don't smoke.
GEORGE Nooooooo......
JERRY You know, I think I'm getting a little depressed about George's wedding.
ELAINE Really?
JERRY Yeah. Well once he gets married that's it, she'll probably get pregnant, they'll move to Westchester. I'll never see him again.
ELAINE Yeah! You're probably right.
JERRY Then it'll just be me, you and Kramer.
ELAINE No! Not me pal. I can't keep this up much longer. I'm sick of being single. I'm getting out.
JERRY So it's just gonna be me and Kramer.
ELAINE Yep! just you and Kramer.
JERRY See you ... me and Kramer...
KRAMER Hey!! Buddy. I thought of a great invention for driving. A periscope in a car, so you can see the traffic.
JERRY How you gonna drive when looking through a periscope? Besides it's not a submarine and there's no room for a periscope in a car.
KRAMER Huh! You make a higher roof.
JERRY They're not making higher roofs.
KRAMER why can't you make a higher roof.
JERRY Because it's a stupid idea. No one's gonna go for it. Don't you understand It's stupid, stupid...
JERRY .....Stupid , stupid.
JEANNIE Hey! Hey! Look out. Ok!, Are you okay?
JERRY Yeah!.. Thanks.Oh! my god you saved my life.
JEANNIE Shouldn't there be some kind of reward for that.
JERRY oh! thank you.
JEANNIE You know you should be a lot more careful crossing the street like that, otherwise you could die.. If that bothers you.
JERRY Well I...
JEANNIE You see.. To me this is a waste.
JERRY What?
JEANNIE The shirt you got on under your sweather.It sits for three weeks in your drawer, waiting to come out. and when it finally does . It sticks up only half an inch out of your collar.
JERRY I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
JEANNIE Jeannie Steinman.
JERRY Hey! Same initials . How do you like that?
JEANNIE I like it.
GEORGE Listen I was talking to Elaine today and she said she'd would really like to be an usher at the wedding
SUSAN No. Out of the question. I don't want any women ushers at my wedding and while we're on the subject, Kramer is not an usher either.
GEORGE Why not?
SUSAN He doesn't even know my name.
GEORGE That was an honest mistake.
SUSAN Nah! He's too weird he'd fall or something. He'd ruin the whole ceremony.
GEORGE Yeah! You're right.. You're probably right.
SUSAN Whadda doing? Since when do you smoke?
GEORGE I've always smoked.
SUSAN I've never seen you smoke.
GEORGE Oh yeeah.. well , Big smoker... I gave it up for a while but it was too tough. Y' know.....I got no will power.
SUSAN I don't like this one bit.
GEORGE Well I can't stop now... I'm addicted...
SUSAN Well you are gonna have to quit.
GEORGE Oh my god....
WAITRESS Menus?

JERRY Uh! Really .That's nice.
KRAMER Now what's with you?
JERRY I think I'm in love.
KRAMER Oh. Come on.
JERRY No it's true. This woman saved my life. I was crossing the street .I was almost hit by a car...and then we talked and.......the whole thing just seemed like a dream.
KRAMER If a guy saved your life you'd be in love with him too.
JERRY No, no this woman is different , she's incredible. she's just like me. She talks like me, she acts like me. She even ordered cereal at a restaurant. We even have the same initials. Wait a minute, I just realised what's going on.
KRAMER What?
JERRY Now I know what I've been looking for all these years......myself! I've been waiting for me to come along and now I 've swept myself off my feet.
KRAMER You stop it man.. you're freaking me out!!
KRAMER Hey!
TELLER Hey!
KRAMER Hey! wait a second. You didn't say hello.
TELLER Yes I did
KRAMER No no you didn't ...Hundred dollars.. I get a hundred dollars.
TELLER No, No I said Hello.
KRAMER No, No You said Hey!
TELLER Well.. Hey! is Hello, same thing.
KRAMER The ad said that the bank's gonna pay a hundred dollars if you are not greeted with a hello
TELLER You're taking that much to literally. Now sir , do you have any business to transact.
KRAMER No, I want to speak to the manager.
TELLER Well, He's not here right now.
KRAMER Then I'll be back.
ELAINE So I'm not gonna be an usher?
GEORGE No..
ELAINE So I'm nothing. Jerry is best man , Kramer is an usher and I am nothing.
GEORGE Well Kramer's not an usher anymore.
KRAMER What are you talking about?
GEORGE You've been demoted.
KRAMER Why?
GEORGE Because you called her by the wrong name.
KRAMER But she really looks like a Lily
ELAINE Jerry Jerry, Susan says I can't be an usher at he wedding.
KRAMER Yeah. me neither.
JERRY Hey George I think I want to bring a date to the wedding
GEORGE Who!!?
JERRY I just met her, she's incredible.
ELAINE Aaawh...This is great!!.....Now I'm gonna be stuck at the singles table with all the losers.
JERRY You can go with Kramer
KRAMER No , no no no no. Weddings are a great place to meet chicks. I have to be unfettered.
GEORGE Do you see what this is turning in to? Do I need this. I have to get out of this thing.
ELAINE Did you try the cigarettes?
GEORGE Yeah.. They made me sick.
KRAMER All right, All right. Lets get down here. You really want to get out of this thing ?
GEORGE Yeah...
KRAMER All right. I got two words for you; Pre-Nup.
GEORGE What does that mean?
KRAMER Ask her to sign a pre-nup.
GEORGE What does that do?

DOCTOR Excuse me , Are you the husband?
GEORGE Well , not yet.. Fiance.
DOCTOR Well , I'm sorry.....She's gone.
GEORGE .........What's that?...
DOCTOR She expired.
GEORGE ...Are you sure?
DOCTOR Yes , of course.
GEORGE So.....She's dead?
DOCTOR Yes
GEORGE ...Huh!
DOCTOR Let me ask you ; Had she been exposed to any kind of inexpensive glue?
GEORGE ...Why?
DOCTOR We found traces of a certain toxic adhesive commonly found in very low priced envelopes.
GEORGE Well she was sending out our wedding invitations.
DOCTOR That's probably what did it.
GEORGE We were expecting about two hundred people...Well...Thank you , thank you.
GEORGE She's ahem....gone
JERRY Dead?
ELAINE I'm so sorry George
JERRY Yeah! me too
KRAMER Poor Lily..
JERRY How did it happen?
GEORGE Apparently the glue in the wedding invitations was a....toxic.
ALL Aah!..
KRAMER Well that's weird
JERRY So I guess , you're not getting married?
GEORGE Yes.
JERRY But....
GEORGE Yeah?
JERRY Well , now I'm engaged..
GEORGE Yeah?...
JERRY Well I thought we'd both be getting married.
GEORGE Hey!.. What can I tell ya.
ELAINE All right.
GEORGE well humm.. lets get some coffee.
JERRY We had a pact!!!
GEORGE Yes I'd like to speak to Marisa Tomei, please? Marisa, Hi it's George Costanza.. I'm the short, funny, quirky bald man you met a little while ago, heh! yeah I was just calling 'cos I wanted you to know that I'm not engaged anymore......well huh, She died....Toxic glue from the wedding invitations.....well we were expecting about two hundred people. Yeah... Anyway.. hum I got the funeral tomorrow but huh.. my weekend is pretty wide open and I was wondering... ..... Hello...Hello..
JERRY You can't just have an adultery-- you commit adultery. And you can't even commit adultery unless you already have a commitment. So you have to make the commitment before you can even think about committing it. There's no commit without the commit. Then, once you commit, then you can commit the adultery and then you get caught, get divorced, lose your mind and they have you committed. But y'know some people actually cheat on the people that they're cheating with. Which is like, y'know, being in a hold up and then turning to the robber next to you and goin' "Alright, gimme everything you have, too".
GEORGE You met her at the supermarket? How did you do that?
JERRY Produce section. Very provocative area. A lot of melons and shapes. Everyone's squeezing and smelling... It just happened.
GEORGE So when're you gonna see her?
JERRY Tonight.
GEORGE What's her name?
JERRY I... don't... know...
GEORGE How could you not know her name?
JERRY I was a little nervous, I got distracted. It has something to do with a car, or a fish...
JERRY Look at that. Why do I get bananas? They're good for one day...
GEORGE Oh my God, I forgot to tell you. I got a letter today from the State Controller's Office. Y'know when I was going to public school back in Brooklyn, every week I used to put fifty cents in the Lincoln Savings Bank.
JERRY Yeah, I did that too.
GEORGE You remember the, the little bank book, there?
JERRY Sure.
GEORGE Alright, so I haven't put anything in it since sixth grade, I completely forgot about it. The State Controller's Office tracks me down. The interest has accumulated to 1 900 dollars. 1 900 dollars! They're sending me a cheque!
JERRY Wow!
GEORGE Yeah, interest. It's an amazing thing. You make money without doing anything...
JERRY Y'know I have friends who try to base their whole life on that principle.
GEORGE Really? Who?
JERRY Nobody you know...
GEORGE Maybe I'll go down to the track. Put it all on a horse...
JERRY Why don't you put it in the bank?
GEORGE The bank? This is found money. I want to parlay it. I wanna make a big score!
JERRY Oh, you mean you wanna lose it...
GEORGE What's with the gloves?
KRAMER Well, I'm staining my floors and, y'know, I don't want to get my hands dirty...
GEORGE What, the whole apartment?
KRAMER The whole apartment. And I'm buying that fake wood wallpaper. I'm gonna surround myself in wood. It's gonna be like a log cabin. 'Cuz I need wood around me. Wood, Jerry ... Wood.
JERRY What, you rented "Home Alone"?
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY I thought you saw that already...
GEORGE No, I saw "Home Alone II".
JERRY Oh, right... But you hated it!
GEORGE Well I was lost, I never saw the first one. By the way, do you mind if I watch it here?
JERRY What for?
JERRY Because if I watch it at my apartment I feel like I'm not doing anything. If I watch it here, I'm out of the house; I'm doing something.
KRAMER I can't work with these!
JERRY What's wrong?
KRAMER Well, you bought me dishwashing gloves. There's no fine touch...
JERRY You said "gloves"...
KRAMER No, no, these are too thick.
KRAMER Oooh, is that "Home Alone"?
GEORGE Yeah. The original.
ELAINE Hey Boys-O!
ELAINE Remember Roy, the artist?
JERRY Right, the "triangle" guy.
ELAINE Exactly, the "triangle" guy.
JERRY Yeah, you liked him. What happened with him?
ELAINE Yeah I did. He was very talented. He was just a little too...
JERRY Artsy?
ELAINE Fat.
JERRY Oh.
ELAINE He was a fat, starving artist, y'know. That's very rare. Anyway, he's in the hospital, he's having surgery and I feel like should go visit him.
ELAINE Listen, Jerry can you do me a favour? Could you go into the room with me to visit him because I don't want him to think that I'm, y'know... interested.
JERRY Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend.
ELAINE Well...
JERRY Well I think I can do that. I believe I've played that role before to some critical acclaim.
ELAINE What's with him?
JERRY Y'know a lot of people have asked that...
ELAINE Roy!
ROY Elaine! What a surprise.
ELAINE Oh, my God! I hardly recognise you! You look so...
ROY I've lost some weight...
ELAINE A lot of weight.
ROY I know.
ELAINE You look terrific.
ROY Thank you. So do you.
ELAINE This is... uh... you really lost weight.
ROY Thank you.
JERRY Jerry, uh, I'm the boyfriend.
WOMAN Waaaaaaaaa!
KRAMER Ah, the mother lode!
ELAINE I can't believe it! You were huge! Like blubber! I couldn't even get my arms around you...
ROY Yes, I remember.
ELAINE Well that's the positive thing about getting sick, you get to lose weight.
ROY Elaine, it wasn't the illness. It was you.
ROY After you stopped seeing me, I was devastated. I couldn't eat for weeks.
ELAINE Get out!
ROY Really, it's the truth.
ELAINE Jerry, did you hear that? He couldn't eat for weeks...
JERRY That's terrible...
ELAINE I had no idea I had that kind of effect on you.
ROY You did.
JERRY You know I can't get this damn thing to sleep...
ELAINE Now listen, tell me something. When are you gettin out of here?
ROY Next Thursday.
ELAINE Okay, I'll tell you what. How about on Friday I take you out for a big meal because you are getting too thin...
JERRY Honey... Aren't we going to the Poconos next Friday?
ELAINE No that's the week after.
JERRY No, I believe it's next week.
ELAINE You're wrong.
JERRY No I'm not...
ELAINE Shut up...
KRAMER Pay dirt!
ELAINE Uh Roy, this is Kramer-- he's one of our friends.
ROY How do you do?
KRAMER I do great.
DOCTOR Hi Roy.
ROY Oh, hey Dr. Siegel.
JERRY Hey Doc, check this out. I just learned that.
DOCTOR I just wanted to stop by to see if you had any questions about tomorrow's operation.
KRAMER Yeah, I have a question. What do you know about inter-abdominal retractors?
DOCTOR Are you asking because you saw "20/20" last night?
KRAMER I sure am.
DOCTOR Well that report was about one very specific type of retractor and I can assure you we do not use that kind type of retractor in your friend's procedure.
KRAMER But you will use... a retractor.
DOCTOR We have to...
KRAMER Mmm-hmm...
DOCTOR Tell you what. You're obviously concerned about your friend's welfare. A few of my students will be observing tomorrow's operation from the viewing gallery. How would you like to watch it with them?
KRAMER I'd love to watch the operation, yeah!
JERRY I dunno...
KRAMER Oh, come on Jerry. You gotta see the operation. They're gonna cut him open. His guts'll be all over the place...
JERRY Yeah, that's true...
KRAMER ...They'll saw through bone. You'll see what's inside bone...
JERRY Hey.
GEORGE Hi...
JERRY What are doing, you crying??
GEORGE No...
JERRY You crying from "Home Alone"??
GEORGE The old man got to me.
JERRY Alright, just get yourself together... I dunno if I can be friends with you anymore after this display
GEORGE Shut up! What are you doing back so soon, anyway?
JERRY Oh, I never even got to the gym. Kramer got the gloves and wanted to get home and start working on his floor.
GEORGE How's the guy?
JERRY Oh, he's okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting pretty chummy. Now Elaine wants me to buy some of his art.
GEORGE That's nerve...
JERRY Yeah, so she and "Triangle Boy" can go out to fancy restaurants.
GEORGE Y'know what it is? It's "Clara Nightingale Syndrome". He falls ill; she falls in love.
JERRY You mean Florence Nightingale.
GEORGE What'd I say? Clara?
JERRY Yeah, you must have meant Clara Barton.
GEORGE Clara Barton? What did she do?
JERRY I'm not sure, but I think she was nice.
GEORGE Susan B. Anthony I think I'd have a problem with.
JERRY Yeah, I think you would.
GEORGE So, you gonna buy his art?
JERRY No. Why don't you buy it? You got 1 900 dollars.
GEORGE Yeah, that's what I want-- triangles. Alright, I'm outta here. Have fun with what's-her-name.
JERRY I will.
GEORGE Y'know, now you gotta ask her her name. It's so embarrassing.
JERRY No, it isn't. I can find out.
GEORGE Yeah? How?
JERRY There are ways.
JERRY Y'know I remember when I was a kid growin up, kids would make fun of my name like you wouldn't believe-- "Jerry Jerry Dingleberry", "Seinsmelled"...
WOMAN "Seinsmelled"?
JERRY Yeah. What about you? Did people make fun of your name?
WOMAN Are you kidding? They were merciless! What do you expect when your name rhymes with a part of the female anatomy? Of course, not everybody can be as sweet as you are.
WOMAN Oh, Jerry...
JERRY Oh... you...
GEORGE Now let's try "breast"... Celeste... Kest...
JERRY No.
GEORGE Rest... Sest... Hest...
JERRY "Hest"? That's not a name.
GEORGE What, you should've just asked her.
JERRY I know, I should've asked her.
GEORGE What're you gonna do now?
JERRY I dunno. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with her. Once you make out with a woman, you can't ask her her name.
GEORGE Aretha!
JERRY No...
GEORGE Bovary!
JERRY Alright, that's enough.
GEORGE Alright, well you know what you gotta do, you gotta go through her purse. Y'know, the credit cards, driver's license...
JERRY How am I gonna do that?
GEORGE When she goes to the bathroom.
KRAMER Ah, there you are. My date stood me up. Listen, will you guys go to the operation with me?
JERRY You asked a date to go to the operation?
KRAMER Yeah... So c'mon, what d'you say?
GEORGE What kind of operation is it?
KRAMER Spleenectomy.
GEORGE Isn't that where they remove the--
KRAMER Don't ruin it for me, I haven't seen it yet!
KRAMER C'mon, what d'you say?
GEORGE Mulva!
JERRY Mulva?
KRAMER C'mon, do you wanna go?
JERRY Alright, alright. Just let me finish my coffee... then we'll go watch them slice this fat bastard up.
DOCTOR Now we'll open the peritoneal cavity, exposing the body's internal organs. Nurse-- retractor.
JERRY What are you eating?
KRAMER Junior Mints. Do you want one?
JERRY No...
KRAMER I can't see... Psst....
JERRY Where'd you get those?
KRAMER The machine. You want one? Here, take one.
JERRY I don't want any!
KRAMER No, they're good!
JERRY I don't want any!
KRAMER Just take one.
JERRY No! Kramer, stop it! 30
JERRY ...Over the balcony, bounced off some respirator thing into the patient!
GEORGE What do you mean "into the patient"?
JERRY Into the patient, literally!
GEORGE Into the hole?
JERRY Yes, the hole!
GEORGE Didn't they notice it?
JERRY No!
GEORGE How could they not notice it?!?
JERRY Because it's a little mint. It's a Junior Mint.
GEORGE What did they do?
JERRY They sealed him up with the mint inside.
GEORGE They left the Junior Mint in him?
JERRY Yes!
GEORGE I guess it can't hurt him... People eat pounds of those things.
JERRY They eat them, they don't put them next to vital organs in their abdominal cavity!
KRAMER Hey, this wallpaper is very good. My place looks like a ski lodge!
JERRY Why did you force that mint on me? I didn't want the mint!
KRAMER Well, I didn't believe you.
JERRY How could you not believe me?!?
KRAMER Who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's peppermint-- it's delicious!
JERRY That's true.
KRAMER It's very refreshing!
JERRY Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine...
ELAINE Prognosis... negative.
JERRY Prognosis negative!?
ELAINE He's not doing well, the doctors don't know what it is. They're baffled. J+K Oh, my God...
ELAINE Just my luck, y'know... just when he's getting thin and attractive. Y'know Jerry, you should buy some of his art. That would really lift his spirits.
GEORGE It's that bleak?
ELAINE Mmm...
GEORGE Y'know if the guy dies, the art could really be worth something...
JERRY We gotta confess.
KRAMER Really?
JERRY Yes!
KRAMER We could be tried for murder...
JERRY I can't have this on my conscience. We're like Leopold and Loeb!
KRAMER You're not gonna say anything, you got that?
JERRY I'm telling and you can't stop me!
KRAMER You're not!!!
GEORGE Hey Elaine? Put me down for some of that art. 1 900 dollars worth.
JERRY Oh yeah, that's the spot...
WOMAN What're you so tense about?
JERRY Oh, nothing really... Just a homicide. Oh that's terrific... Mulva.
WOMAN What?
JERRY Mulva?
WOMAN Mulva?
JERRY My Aunt's name is Mulva. She's a masseuse.
WOMAN I'm going to the bathroom. Be right back.
JERRY Oh, good idea...
WOMAN What are you doing?
JERRY Oh, I was just looking for some... gum or... mint.
WOMAN Oh, I have Junior Mints.
JERRY No! No, I mean, no thank you...
KRAMER Any news?
JERRY No, you better get out of here. No, wait a second... Wait a second... I don't know the name of this woman in the bathroom, so when she comes out, you introduce yourself and then she'll be forced to say her name.
KRAMER 10-4.
WOMAN Oh, hello.
KRAMER Hello, I'm Kramer.
WOMAN Nice to meet you.
KRAMER See you later.
WOMAN Well, I better get going. I don't want to be late for the play. Y'know my cousin knows the producer. I may get to go backstage and meet Olympia Dukakis.
JERRY Hey, there's a name you don't forget.
WOMAN Oh, hi.
GEORGE Hi, I'm George.
WOMAN Nice to meet you, George.
GEORGE I gave it a shot... So, any word on the "artiste"?
JERRY No, I haven't heard anything.
GEORGE Well, I got my triangles.
JERRY Really...
GEORGE Yup, y'know, they really spruce up the apartment.
JERRY Yeah, I'm sure...
JERRY Well, I gotta call the Hospital. I gotta tell 'em what happened.
GEORGE No, Jerry. I wouldn't do that.
JERRY Why?
GEORGE You could get in trouble.
JERRY Look, I gotta try and help the guy.
GEORGE Who are you to play God!? Every man's time comes! If his number is up, who are you to interfere!?
JERRY Yes I'd like to speak to Dr. Siegel... it's about Roy Kordic's condition...
GEORGE What? What?
JERRY Oh, thats fantastic!
GEORGE He didn't get better, did he?
JERRY Thank you very much. Bye-bye. He's gonna be okay!
GEORGE Where's the luck? There's no luck. 1 900 dollars down the drain.
ROY You saved my life, George. You buying my art is what inspired me to get better. I'll never forget what you did for me.
GEORGE Oh, that's great. That's great.
KRAMER Y'know, art is a great investment.
ELAINE It's gonna look great in your apartment, George.
GEORGE Yes I look forward to many years of looking at the triangles. Well, I'll wait for you outside.
ROY Hey, George...
DOCTOR Y'know I don't want to totally discount the emotional element in your recovery, but I think there were other factors at play here.
JERRY What do you mean?
DOCTOR I have no medical evidence to back me up, but something happened during the operation that staved off that infection. Something beyond science. Something perhaps from above...
KRAMER Mint?
DOCTOR Those can be very refreshing.
ROY So Elaine... Where are we going for our big dinner on Friday?
ELAINE I'm so sorry Roy, but actually, we're going to the Poconos on Friday, right honey?
JERRY I don't think so...
ELAINE We are...
JERRY I believe we're not...
ELAINE Please can we go to the Poconos?
JERRY Well, I'll think about it...
WOMAN Great seats. You could see the actors spitting.
JERRY Really...
WOMAN And afterwards we went backstage and Olympia Dukakis autographed my playbill.
JERRY Oh, what're you saying, you got her autograph?
WOMAN Yeah.
JERRY Do you have it with you?
WOMAN Yeah, it's in my purse.
JERRY Let me see.
WOMAN Y'know I really think I'm falling for you, Jerry Seinfeld.
WOMAN Oh, well, I really think I'm falling for you... ...Joseph Puglia...
WOMAN I had it autographed for my uncle.
JERRY Yeah, I know...
WOMAN You don't know my name, do you?
JERRY Yes I do.
WOMAN What is it?
JERRY It, uh, rhymes with a female body part.
WOMAN What is it?
JERRY Mulva...
JERRY Gipple?
JERRY Loleola?
JERRY Oh! Oh! Delores! 15
JERRY Ages zero through ten, candy is your life. There's nothing else. Family, friends, school-- they're only obstacles in the way of getting more candy. And you have your favourite candies that you love. "I love those... I hate those...". "I hate those... I love those...". And only a seven year old kid can taste the difference between a red M&M and a light brown M&M. Two totally different things when you're seven years old. "Well, your red is more of a main course M&M, but the brown is more of a mellower flavour; it's an after dinner M&M, really".
JERRY Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because money's a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat money has no value. And you don't care about money when you're hungry, you sit down at a restaurant. You're like the ruler of an empire. "More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! It will be the greatest meal of our lives." Then after the meal, you know, you've got the pants open, you've got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes - then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset, you know. They're mystified by the check. "What is this? How could this be?" They start passing it around the table, "Does this look right to you? We're not hungry now. Why are we buying all this food?!" I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.
GEORGE I never heard him say anything really funny.
JERRY But it's common sense. He's got super strength, super speed.. I'm sure he's got super humor.
GEORGE You would think that, but either you're born with a sense of humor, or you're not. It's not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth.
JERRY Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of Earth?
GEORGE I don't know but he ain't funny.
ELAINE I know, I know. I'm sorry I'm late.
JERRY No problem.
ELAINE I dropped a grape.
GEORGE Pardon?
ELAINE I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldn't find it. I was... I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I have no idea where it went.
JERRY Were you crying? I mean, it's just a grape. You'll find it.
ELAINE No, I'm just getting over an allergy attack. This guy I'm going out with
JERRY Robert.
ELAINE Robert. Yes.. thank you. He has two cats and I'm allergic to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I can't even go into his apartment, you know. And, of course, my apartment is the actor's studio so we can't go there. It's really causing a lot of problems, you know. He won't even go away fro the weekend because of these cats.
GEORGE Guys with cats.. I don't know.
JERRY I've been thinking about asking this girl I'm, uh, seeing -
ELAINE Vanessa.
JERRY Vanessa, thank you.. I've been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days.
GEORGE Oh no. No, no,no,no,no. I'd have to advise against that. What do you know this woman, a month? Let's see, you're going to be with her seventy-two hours. That's a dating decathlon.
ELAINE Hey, why don't you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. She'll love it.
GEORGE That's exquisite. Listen, uh, if it's not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?
JERRY You better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. There was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the Texas panhandle. They brought in the army, nobody could stop it. Apparently it had a pit of steel.
GEORGE Up again?! This is incredible. I'm.. I'm getting it.
ELAINE You're getting what?
GEORGE A stock.
JERRY What stock?
GEORGE Did you ever meet my friend, Simons?
JERRY Maybe.
GEORGE He knows this guy, Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the stock market. Now he's got some new thing - you know, there's supposed to be a big merger. He wasn't even supposed to say anything. You guys should think about doing this too.
JERRY How high's it suppose to go?
GEORGE I don't know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?
JERRY Boy.. I don't know.
ELAINE I'd do it but I don't have any money.
JERRY What kind of company is it?
GEORGE It's Sendrax. They've got some new kind of technique for televising opera.
ELAINE Televising opera?
GEORGE Some sort of electronic thingy.
JERRY Well, how much are you going to invest?
GEORGE Five thousand.. ten. Ten thousand.. Five thousand.
JERRY Boy..
GEORGE C'mon. Wilkinson's got millions invested in this stock. It's gone up three points since I've been watching it.
JERRY What if I lose it?
GEORGE C'mon, go for twenty-five hundred. We'll do it together. Come on, come on. We're in it together.
JERRY All right -- twenty-five hundred.
GEORGE That's it.
WAITRESS Yeah, can I take your order?
GEORGE Check the raiser.
JERRY My bet? All right.. I'll open with a tuna sandwich.
ELAINE Tuna?
JERRY Oh, the dolphin thing?
ELAINE They're dying in the nets.
JERRY Ooohhh.. You know, the whole concept of lunch is based on tuna.
ELAINE Jerry, can't you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine?
JERRY Hey, when I'm driving, I let people in ahead of me all the time. I'm always waving everybody in. "Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead." ..Alright.. alright. I'll have a chicken salad.
ELAINE And I'm going to have an English muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee.
WAITRESS Okay. What about you?
GEORGE I'll have the tuna.
JERRY I have to say. Those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me.
VANESSA Why didn't you do something?
JERRY What do you want me to do? I have the guy the half-turn. Then I have him the full-turn with the eye roll! I mean, beyond that, I'm risking a punch in the mouth.. Excuse me, do you have these in the puffs?
STOCK_BOY No puffs. Just flakes.
JERRY Have you thought any more about that trip?
VANESSA Yeah, I've been thinking about it.
JERRY You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont.
VANESSA I don't know. I just worry about trips like this.. It's a lot of pressure.
JERRY It's great! It speeds up the intimacy level. It's like putting the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months from now we accomplish three days.
VANESSA Oh, so you want to move our relationship into Phase Two..?
JERRY Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased call frequency, walking around naked.. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two.
VANESSA Really? Could we go fishing up there?
JERRY Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?
VANESSA They have marlin in Vermont?
JERRY Oh, big fighting marlin.
VANESSA Jerry, the stock is the same as when you checked it earlier. There are no changes after the market closes. The stock is still down.
JERRY I know. But this is a different paper. I thought maybe they have, uh, different.. sources.
JERRY Is that my paper?
KRAMER Bad news, my friend.
JERRY What? What news?
KRAMER Sendrax.
JERRY Oh, c'mon! It's down again?!
KRAMER Two and a half points.
JERRY Oh, I can't believe it. Let me see that. That's four and a half points in three days! That's almost half my money!
KRAMER Hey, I told ya.
JERRY Yeah, you told me.
KRAMER It's all manipulated with junk bonds. You can't win.
JERRY There's one thing I don't understand. Why does it please you? George Costanza, please.
KRAMER Hey, I don't care. I'm just telling you to get rid of that stock, now!
JERRY George, what's going on?!
KRAMER Sell it, just say I'm selling!
JERRY Well, where is the guy?! Nothing? Almost half my money's gone.. Well, call me right back. Nobody can reach Wilkinson. He hasn't been home or in his office in the past three days!
KRAMER You know, I can't believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you could've invested in my roll-out tie dispenser.
JERRY Roll-out tie dispenser? What was that one?
KRAMER Okay, you're in a restaurant. You've got a very big meeting coming up.
JERRY Okay.
KRAMER You just tear it off, and you got a new one right here. Then you're gone.
JERRY You're gone alright.
KRAMER Hey, where.. where are you going? You gonna take a trip? The map.. what..
JERRY Yeah, I'm going to Vermont with Vanessa for a few days.
KRAMER Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming over this weekend.
JERRY What friends?
KRAMER Well, it's just some people I met at a rock concert.
KRAMER Do you mind if they use your bed? 'Cause they're really good people, Jerry. I'm telling you. You know, they're anarchists. They're.. they're.. they're.. huge.
JERRY George.. what?! You're kidding.. Well, what's wrong?.. So, what are we gonna do?.. Great! Alright, I'll speak to you later. Wilkinson, the guy who's supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, he's in the hospital.
JERRY So you don't know what's wrong with him?
GEORGE All Simons was able to find out is that he's in the hospital.
JERRY Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?
GEORGE Of course he's been in touch with him. He's left two messages. He just hasn't heard back yet, that's all.
JERRY Well, this is it. I'm selling.
GEORGE Just give it a little more time.
JERRY I never should've gotten involved in this. I'm a nervous wreck. I"m not cut out for investing.
GEORGE Alright, alright. That's it. I'm gonna go down there.
JERRY Where?
GEORGE To the hospital.
JERRY The hospital?
GEORGE I'm going to find out what's going on. Alright?
JERRY Are you nuts? You don't even know they guy.
GEORGE So what? I'll start talking to him, you know, casual, and I'll work my way around to it.
JERRY What if he's in an iron lung or something? What are you gonna do? "How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson? By the way, what's happening with Sendrax?"
GEORGE Maybe he's resting.
JERRY Who goes to the hospital to rest?
GEORGE What are you, a doctor?
JERRY Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?
GEORGE Today. I'm going today. Just don't do anything until you hear from me.
JERRY Alright.
GEORGE Boy, I have to get to a bathroom.
DRY_CLEANER May I help you?
JERRY Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. It's completely shrunk. There's absolutely no way I can wear it.
DRY_CLEANER When did you bring it in?
JERRY What's the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of this shirt?!
DRY_CLEANER You got a receipt?
JERRY I can't find the receipt.
DRY_CLEANER You should get the receipt.
JERRY Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! It's a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?!
DRY_CLEANER Yes, but how do I know we did the shirt?
JERRY What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money?! In fact, forget the money. I don't even want the money. I just once, I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. That's what I want. I want an admission of guilt.
DRY_CLEANER Maybe you asked for it to be washed?
JERRY No.. dry-cleaned.
DRY_CLEANER Let me explain to you something. Okay? With certain types of fabrics, different chemicals can react, causing..
JERRY You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it!
DRY_CLEANER I shrunk it.
JERRY I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, "Well, it's ruined." And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, "It's not our fault. We're not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation." You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible. Right? They're cleaning our clothes - but they're not getting anything wet. It's all dry. I know there's gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids that they're using. There's no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that - that's dry cleaning. I don't think that's what they're doing back there. They don't have eighty guys going "Come on, hurry up! There's a lot of shirts today."
JERRY Bless you.
ELAINE Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because they're clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers four times a day and he can't count to ten. So don't give me hygiene.
JERRY So what are you gonna do?
ELAINE I don't know. I can't think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats?
JERRY Well, it couldn't be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?
ELAINE What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?
JERRY I'm no cat killer.
ELAINE How about we go over there right now and we shave them?
JERRY I'd really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go.
ELAINE He actually wen to the hospital?
JERRY Yeah.
ELAINE Oh man, he's nuts.
JERRY Yeah, he's nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats. I know, I know. It's down again.
KRAMER How much are you down altogether?
JERRY I don't know.. fifteen hundred dollars.
KRAMER Wow.
JERRY You don't have to say "Wow." I know it's "Wow." And there's that smile again. Well, what is that?
JERRY It's George.
KRAMER Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.
JERRY I really don't need to look.
KRAMER What a body. Yeeaahh.. that's for me.
JERRY Yeah, and you're just what she's looking for too - a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up.
KRAMER I'm gonna go down there and try and talk to her.
JERRY What? What? Did you go down there? Did he tell you what's gonna happen? How long were you there?
GEORGE Fifteen seconds.
JERRY You told him you knew Simons?
GEORGE Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know - I'm in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. I'll tell you one thing.. I don't know what he's got. But for a sick guy, he's very strong.
JERRY Well, that's it. Look, I'm going to Vermont. I don't want to think about this. I'm selling.
ELAINE Didn't work, huh?
GEORGE Not quite.
ELAINE Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?
GEORGE I'm keeping it. I'm going down with the ship.
JERRY So I know this guy. I'm getting all my sneakers at a discount now.
VANESSA I know. You mentioned it.
JERRY Oh yeah, right. Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And I've still got another day! I've got nothing left to say. Wait.. wait.. got one. That's a nice watch. Do you wind it?
VANESSA No, it's got a little battery.
JERRY Well, that's good. Well, the drive home should be a delight. I'm speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I don't care. That' the manager? Do you wnat me to see if we can get another room?
VANESSA No, it's okay.
JERRY So, I guess you don't find the separate faucets for the hot and cold - charming?
VANESSA Not especially.
JERRY Well, what do you wnat to do this afternoon?
VANESSA What can we do? It's raining.
JERRY We cold play "Sorry!" We cold play "Steal the Old Man's Bundle." Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. What kind of perfume is that you're wearing?
VANESSA Oh, you've never heard of it.
JERRY No, what? What kind is it?
VANESSA I can't tell you.
JERRY Yeah, that's normal. Excuse me, Sir. Could I have a look at that business section?
VANESSA That stock? I thought you got out of that?
JERRY I did. I'm just curious. It's been almost a week. I want to check it out. Six points. It's up six points!
VANESSA I told you not to sell.
JERRY You did not tell me not to sell.
VANESSA I said, the market fluctuates. Remember?
JERRY Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!
VANESSA That's probably why..
JERRY What?
VANESSA Forget it.
JERRY No, what? 'That's probably why..'
VANESSA That's probably why we're staying here, because you lost money on the stock.
JERRY So, what am I looking at here? Twenty=nine hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the name of that purfume..
GEORGE Have something else. C'mon, have a little dessert?
JERRY I'm good, thanks.
GEORGE Elaine, get something! It's all taken care of.
ELAINE I'm kinda full.
GEORGE So don't finish it.
JERRY She's full. So, Big daddy. I'm just curious. How much did you clear on your little trasaction there? All told?
GEORGE I don't like to discuss figures.
JERRY How much?
GEORGE I don't know, what? Eight thousand. It's a Hyundai. Get out of here.. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.
JERRY So, Wilkinson's out of the hospital now?
GEORGE No. You'd be surprised. You don't recover that quickly from a nose job.
JERRY Is taht still from the cats?
ELAINE No, I just have a cold.
JERRY So, what ever happened with that?
ELAINE I gave him an ultimatum.
GEORGE He chose the cats?
ELAINE They're very clean animals.
JERRY I gotta say, that's pretty sad. Losing out to a cat.
ELAINE Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.
GEORGE I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you can't get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time. You'd get all the money back - you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont.
ELAINE Superman can go back in time?
JERRY We went over that.
GEORGE Wilkinson's got a bite on a new one.. Petramco Corp. Out of, hu, Springfield. I think. They're about to introduce some sort of robot butcher.
JERRY A robot butcher?
GEORGE Shhhhh. If you want to get in - there's very little time. Sweetheart.. No, no, no. That' ought to coever it. Just a second.. Just a.. let me.. Come on, come on, come on..
JERRY I'm not an investor. People always tell me, you should have your money working for you. I've decided I'll do the work. I'm gonna let the money relax. You know what I mean? 'Cause you send your money out there - working for you - a lot of times, it gets fired. You go back there, "What happened? I had my money. It was here, it was working for me." "Yeah, I remember your money. Showing up late. Taking time off. We had to let him go."
JERRY We never should have landed a man on the moon. It's a mistake. Now everything is compared to that one accomplishment. I can't believe they could land a man on the moon . . . and taste my coffee! I think we all would have been a lot happier if they hadn't landed a man on the moon. Then we'd go, They can't make a prescription bottle top that's easy to open? I'm not surprised they couldn't land a man on the moon. Things make perfect sense to me now. Neil Armstrong should have said, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for every, complaining, sob on the face of the earth. "
ELAINE Hey, do you believe I got happy new year today? It's February.
JERRY I once got Happy new Year in July.
ELAINE It's
JERRY It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out?
ELAINE It's really cold.
JERRY Scary cold.
ELAINE I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?
JERRY That.
ELAINE Huh, What is that, ha?
GEORGE What?
JERRY When did you get that?
GEORGE This week. My father got a deal from a friend of his. It's Gore-Tex. You know about Gore-Tex?
JERRY You like saying Gore-Tex, don't you?
ELAINE You can't even turn around in that thing.
JERRY Look at this
ELAINE Hey George, can you feel this?
GEORGE All right, all right. Knock it off. Come on, let's go.
ELAINE Maybe we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine or something.
GEORGE What for?
ELAINE These people invited us for dinner. We have to bring something.
GEORGE Why?
ELAINE Because it's rude, otherwise.
GEORGE You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude?
ELAINE Yeah.
GEORGE So you're telling me instead of being happy to see me they're going to be upset because I didn't bring anything. You see what I'm saying?
JERRY The fabric of society is very complex George.
GEORGE I don't even drink wine. I drink Pepsi.
ELAINE You can't bring Pepsi.
GEORGE Why not?
ELAINE Because we're adults?
GEORGE You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh, no way wine is better than Pepsi.
JERRY I'm telling you George, I don't think we want to walk in there and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi on the table.
GEORGE I just don't like the ideas that every time there is a dinner invitation there's this annoying little chore that goes along with it.
JERRY You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself.
KRAMER All right, let's go. Who's driving?
JERRY You are. I can't get that thing in my car.
JERRY Where's the heat in this car? Come on Elaine warm me up, oh! I'm cold. Give me a squeeze.
ELAINE Get off of me. Get off of Me!
JERRY You're pretty comfortable up there eh. Bubble boy?
GEORGE Oh, yeah. You wish you had this coat.
ELAINE I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one bottle of wine.
GEORGE Oh, here we go. Why don't we get them a couch? Bring them a nice sectional.
ELAINE We'll get some cake. Can you stop off at the bakery?
GEORGE Why don't you just get some Ring Dings at the liquor store?
ELAINE Ring Dings?
GEORGE Hey, Ring Dings are better than anything you'll ever get at a bakery.
KRAMER I like Ring Dings.
ELAINE George, we can't show up at someone's house with Ring Dings and Pepsi.
KRAMER Hey your lights are on!
GEORGE It's a funeral procession. . . . And I got news for you. I show up with Ring Dings and Pepsi, I become the biggest hit at the party. People be coming up to me, "just between you and me I'm really excited about the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. Europeans with the Beaujolais and Chardonnay . . .
ELAINE Oh, wait a minute. There's the bakery. Stop here. Stop here. Okay, let me out. You, whatever your name is...
JERRY Jerry.
ELAINE Yeah, Jerry, come with me.
KRAMER Okay, so we're going to get the wine and we'll pick you up here in ten minutes.
ELAINE Yeah.
KRAMER All right
ELAINE Ummm, I love the smell of bakeries.
JERRY Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie. I love the black and white. Two races of flavor living side by side It's a wonderful thing isn't it?
ELAINE You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile.
JERRY I'm looking forward to it.
ELAINE Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you.
JERRY Thank you. All right, look at all this stuff. What are we getting'?
ELAINE Chocolate Bobka! That's their specialty.
JERRY Love that Bobka.
ELAINE Yeah, yeah!
JERRY So listen Elaine, when we get up to the door, you , you hold the cake box.
ELAINE Why?
JERRY I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the little string.
ELAINE You think it's effeminate?
JERRY It's a tad dainty.
ELAINE Oh, we forgot to pick a number.
JERRY You see that's not fair. We were here ahead of all these people.
ELAINE You think I should go ask her for hers?
JERRY No, forget it.
ELAINE No, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't mean they were here first. We were here and we were ahead of them, and them, and her. Come on let's just go ask them. Come on. . . . Excuse me.
KRAMER Wow, I'm not finding a spot here. What do you want to do?
GEORGE Just double park
KRAMER No
GEORGE Why not?
KRAMER I'll get a ticket! Besides,, what if somebody wants to get out of here?
GEORGE Are you kidding? People get spaces this good, they never give them up.
KRAMER It's a fallacy.
GEORGE All right, I'll tell you what, why don't you go into the store and I'll wait in the car?
KRAMER Why don't you go into the store and I'll wait in the car?
GEORGE Because, I've got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get cold.
KRAMER So what I'm going to leave the car running and the heater'll be on.
GEORGE Does the heater even work in this car?
KRAMER No.
GEORGE Hey, there's a spot right in front of the liquor store. You see
KRAMER I see.
GEORGE You see, ho ho,
ELAINE But we were here ahead of you.
BARBARA How do I know that?
JERRY Well we saw you come in.
BARBARA Well, that's easy for you to say.
ELAINE Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I make up stories to get ahead in line at bakeries.
CLERK 46?
ELAINE Wait, wait a second are, are you Barbara Benedict?
BARBARA Yes.
ELAINE Oh my god. I, I know you. Um, I'm Elaine Benes, you remember we met at Linda van Grak's baby shower.
BARBARA I'm on my way over there right now.
ELAINE Me too.
DAVID You're Jerry right?
JERRY David!
ELAINE Well,, this is a little awkward, isn't it?
BARBARA Yes it is.
ELAINE You know we were here ahead of you.
BARBARA You're not getting my number.
JERRY Oh so you still don't believe us.
CLERK 47!
BARBARA Us.
ELAINE Oh, oh, fine, go ahead. But listen let me tell you something as soon as I get there I'm going to tell everyone what a jerk you are.
BARBARA Well, I'll be there ahead of you and I'll be telling them what a jerk you are. . . . I'll have the chocolate Bobka.
CLERK You're lucky Mrs. Benedict it's our last one.
GEORGE So alright, what are we getting? It's so hot in here!
KRAMER What do you say we get a Mouton Cadet?
GEORGE What's that?
KRAMER It's robust, bold, very dry. As opposed to a Beaujolais which is richer and fruitier. Here's one. Twelve dollars.
GEORGE Twelve dollars? I knew we should have gone to the bakery. I guarantee you they aren't getting no twelve dollar cake.
KRAMER All right but I am going to have to pay you back latter I don't have my wallet.
GEORGE . . . Why not?
KRAMER Because I don't like to carry my wallet. My osteopath says it's bad for my spine. It throws my hips off kilter
GEORGE "throws your hips off kilter" So where's your money?
KRAMER I never take it.
GEORGE So what do you do?
KRAMER Oh, I get by.
BARBARA See you later
ELAINE_AND_JERRY See you later.
JERRY That's the last Bobka. They got the last Bobka.
ELAINE I know. They're going in first with the last Bobka.
JERRY That was our Bobka.
ELAINE You can't beat a Bobka.
JERRY We should have had that Bobka.
ELAINE They're going to be heroes.
JERRY What are we going to do now. If we can't get the Bobka the whole thing's useless.
ELAINE Well how about a carrot cake?
JERRY Carrot cake? Now why is that a cake? You don't make carrots into a cake. I'm sorry.
ELAINE Black Forrest?
JERRY Black Forrest? Too scary. You're in the Forrest, oohh.
JERRY How about a Napoleon?
ELAINE Napoleon? Who's he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger. Might as well get Mengle.
JERRY That wa sour Bobka. We had that Bobka!
ELAINE What's this one?
CLERK That's cinnamon Bobka.
JERRY Another Bobka?
CLERK There's chocolate and there's cinnamon.
JERRY Well, we've got to get the cinnamon.
ELAINE No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with a lesser Bobka.
JERRY I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no Bobka. People love cinnamon. It should be on tables at restaurants along with salt and pepper. Anytime anyone says, "Oh This is so good. What's in it?" The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again. Lesser Bobka - I think not.
CLERK 49?
ELAINE I'll have the cinnamon Bobka.
JERRY ... and a black and white cookie, for me. Peace!
CLECK That will be 13.05
GEORGE All right here you go.
CLERK A hundred? I can't change that.
GEORGE You can't - oh uh oh All right let's go.
KRAMER Wait a second. I can get change.
KRAMER Hey, anybody got change for a hundred?
GEORGE Hey, hey What are you doing? You'll get us killed.
KRAMER What?
GEORGE Don't go shouting we got a hundred dollar bill. People will be jumping out of windows after us.
KRAMER Okay. Let's go but something. Then we'll get some change.
GEORGE I am not buying something just to get change.
KRAMER George, there's a news stand right over there. Now come on.
KRAMER All rright let's get some gum or something.
GEORGE Pack of gum, okay here you go.
CLERK What I this a hundred? I can't change a hundred.
GEORGE Why not?
CLERK You got to buy more than that.
KRAMER Here, get a newspaper.
GEORGE A newspaper.
CLERK That's not enough.
KRAMER A Clark Bar.
GEORGE Clark Bar.
CLERK Keep going.
GEORGE There's 22 dollars here.
KRAMER George, George, Get a Penthouse Forum.
GEORGE I'm not getting a Penthouse Forum.
KRAMER That will make great dinner party conversation. We'll read the letters at the dinner table.
GEORGE Oh, that's nice.
KRAMER Hey, did you ever read one of these?
GEORGE It's not real. They're all made up.
KRAMER Oh, it's real.
GEORGE You know there is an unusual number of people in this country having sex with amputees! . . . Penthouse forum, newspaper, gum, Clark Bar.
CLERK 6.75.
GEORGE Ah, great. With the wine I'm in over twenty dollars now.
GEORGE Sorry, it's a new coat. It's Gore-Tex.
KRAMER You better be careful with that thing. You'll start a war.
JERRY Uhm, The thing about eating the Black and White cookie, Elaine, is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes better than vanilla and chocolate And yet somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only look to the cookie all our problems would be solved.
ELAINE Your views on race relations are fascinating. You really should do an op-ed piece for the Times.
JERRY Um, um, Look to the cookie Elaine. Look to the cookie.
ELAINE What is this?
JERRY What?
ELAINE It's a hair.
JERRY Oh, take it back. Let's get another one.
ELAINE No, we've already got this. I'll just take it off.
JERRY No, really, let's get another one. It will just take a second.
ELAINE Excuse me.
MAN Hey hey, I'm in line here.
ELAINE No noo no, we just bought this. . . . Um, you sold us a cake with a hair on it.
CLERK You have to take a number.
ELAINE We waited fifteen minutes for this. Oh. You sold me a cake with a hair on it. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing are you going to wait here?
JERRY Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it.
ELAINE It was a little hair. I took it off.
JERRY A little hair? Do you think that makes it better?
ELAINE What if it's your hair?
JERRY What if it's your hair?
ELAINE What is wrong with my hair? Nothing. Nobody takes better care of their hair than me. You can serve dinner on my head.
JERRY Who needs misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. A hundred proof - takes your roots out.
ELAINE Okay, fine, we'll just wait until she calls the number.
JERRY Well, why don't we just forget about the cake?
ELAINE No I'm bringing cake!
GEORGE All right we got the wine. Aren't we lucky? We got wine. Imagine if we didn't bring wine. We'd be shunned by society. Outcasts! Where's your wine? Get out!
KRAMER "I know this is going to sound like a crazy fantasy but every word of this story is true..." " A weeks days ago my girlfriend happened to mention to me how attractive our new neighbor Linda was..."
GEORGE Look at this? Somebody double parked and blocked us in. Does anybody know whose car that is? Maybe there's a note on it. No, no note. Can you believe this?
KRAMER "...well of course I noticed it too with those ample breasts and those pouty lips. I don't have to tell you she was a knock out...."
GEORGE I really can't comprehend how stupid people can be sometimes. Can you comprehend it?
KRAMER No, no I can't comprehend it?
GEORGE I mean we can put a man on the moon but we're basically still very stupid. The guy who's car this is? He could be one of the guys who built the rocket. You see what I'm saying?
KRAMER Yeah, he could build the rocket but he's still stupid for double-parking and blocking somebody in.
GEORGE So you really understand my point about building a rocket and double-parking.
KRAMER Yeah, on one hand he's smart with rockets and on the other part he's dumb with parking. . . . It's cold out here huh?
GEORGE Maybe it's not even stupidity. Maybe it's just a blatant disregard for basic human decency. If this how dictator's start. Do you think Mussolini would circle the block six times looking for a spot?
KRAMER How about Idi Amin?
GEORGE Ill tell you, if I was running for office I would ask for the death penalty for double-parking. If this is allowed to go on this is not a society. This is anarchy!
KRAMER Are those shoes comfortable?
GEORGE No not really.
KRAMER They look comfortable.
GEORGE I know that's why I bought them but they're not comfortable.
ELAINE Why couldn't we have just taken the hair off and go?
JERRY No, out of the question.
ELAINE Why?
JERRY Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.
ELAINE What happened?
JERRY I'd rather not talk about it.
ELAINE You can't tell me?
JERRY All right . . . I once had a hair in my Farina and I freaked out.
ELAINE You found a hair in your Farina?
JERRY Yeah,
ELAINE What happened?
JERRY I started screaming, "There's a hair in my farina. There's a hair in my farina." Then I ran out of the house and I was running and running. I was little but I could run very fast. I just kept running and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site.
ELAINE Wow. Who's hair was it?
JERRY My mother's.
CLERK 68!
ELAINE That's us.
JERRY Oh, good.
ELAINE You sold us a hair with a cake around it. I'd like another one.
CLERK 
JERRY Ah, that's lovely.
ELAINE Ah,
JERRY Just what you want to see, yeah. . . . You want to trade your hair for some phlegm
CLERK Here you are.
ELAINE Um, okay, we got the cake now. Where are George and Kramer?
KRAMER Hey double parker. Soviet scum. Come on out. It's freezing!
GEORGE We're really late now. We're in big trouble. Big trouble.
KRAMER Why?
GEORGE You know, Elaine.
KRAMER What about her?
GEORGE . . . I'm a little scared of her.
KRAMER You're scared of Elaine?
GEORGE Yes!
KRAMER Why?
GEORGE Did you ever see her lose her temper. I was once late because I bought a Panama hat she grabbed it by the brim, pulled it down so hard my head came right through the top of it.
KRAMER Let's go inside the liquor store. It's freezing in here.
GEORGE Why didn't you wear a heavier coat?
KRAMER Because I wanted to look good for the party.
GEORGE Hey, hey that's great! That's very nice. We've been waiting twenty minutes for you people? What do you think? You're Mussolini?
MAN2 Back off puff ball it's not my car!
GEORGE I wasn't talking to you.
ELAINE Wait until I get my hands on that George. I'm going to pull that big hood over his little head, tie the string and suffocate him. You remember that Panama hat? That was nothing.
JERRY Uh, wa?
ELAINE What's the matter with you?
JERRY Uh, I don't feel so good.
ELAINE What's wrong?
JERRY My stomach, I , I think it was that cookie.
ELAINE The black and white?
JERRY Yeah.
ELAINE Not getting along?
JERRY I think I got David Duke and Fahrikan down there.
ELAINE Well if we can't look to the cookie where can we look?
JERRY I feel like I'm going to throw up.
ELAINE Hey, what about your vomit streak?
JERRY I know, I haven't thrown up since June 29th, 1980.
ELAINE Oh, oh!
MAN3 Sooory.
ELAINE Sorry? You almost took my toe off. Why don't you watch what you're doing you, Lunatic!... uh, I think he broke my toe. Where're you going?
JERRY Fourteen years down the drain.
GEORGE Do chickens have individual personalities?
KRAMER I don't care.
GEORGE If you had five chickens could you tell them apart by just the way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Cluck, puk cluck? Because if they have individual personalities I don't think we should be eating them. What's the matter with you?
CLERK Can I help you guys with anything?
GEORGE We bought the wine here before, but now we're blocked in by some car that's double parked and we're just waiting for the guy to pull out.
CLERK Well wait outside. This isn't a hangout. But my friend here has hypothermia.
KRAMER I've got hypothermia.
CLERK All right guys, take it outside.
CLERK You're paying for these.
ELAINE How was it?
JERRY As good as it gets.
GEORGE You know that coat was Gore-Tex. It was worth a hell of a lot more than that cheap Chardonnay.
KRAMER I'm freezing. Definitely freezing. I can't stop shaking.
GEORGE I'm cold too. At least you've got a coat. Let's get in the car.
GEORGE Oh, my god that's Saddam Hussein.
MAN4 Don't walk around without a coat in this weather; you'll catch your death of cold. So long.
CLERK Can I get you anything else?
JERRY Oh, no thanks.
CLERK How about a nice box of "scram".
GEORGE Somebody double parked, we couldn't help it. It might have been Saddam Hussein, we're not really sure. He had a British accent though. What, what happened to you?
ELAINE Somebody put a cane on my foot. Just like the one I'm going to put up your ....
JERRY Hey, what happened to your coat? And what's the smell, what are you drunk?
GEORGE I had to give it to the liquor store guy.
JERRY What for?
GEORGE I spilled some Chardonnay. So what did you get?
ELAINE Cinnamon Bobka.
GEORGE Cinnamon? Why didn't you get chocolate?
JERRY George!
ELAINE Here, here's your cake.
GEORGE And your wine.
ELAINE See ya'.
JERRY See ya'.
JERRY I heard a weather man say that 75% of your body heat is actually lost through the top of the top of the head. Which sounds like you could go skiing naked if you got a good hat. But there's no hat that makes a statement quite like a hat with a flap. The hat with the flaps makes a statement like no other hat makes. This hat says to the world "I would rather have the heat in my skull rather than anything society could possibly offer." In fact I would say if you're on trial for a serious crime and you lawyer recommends the insanity defense, this is the hat to wear. Your lawyer should insist on it. Your honor, "The defense rests."
JERRY Thank you! Goodnight!
SALLY Jerry!
JERRY Hey. Hey!
SALLY Sally Weaver! Susan Ross' roommate from college.. hello!
JERRY Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show?
SALLY Saw it? I loved it! And thank you for the free tickets. You are so funny.
JERRY Oh, thanks.
SALLY No, no, I mean it. You're very funny.
JERRY I believe you.
SALLY Oh, anyway, let me show you Memphis. I am taking you out to dinner.
JERRY Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight to the airport.
SALLY Ohh.. that's too bad.. Susan thought we'd really get along - I guess because we're both wacko! You know what, um.. You have to give this to them for me. Okay? Here. It's a wedding present.
JERRY Oh?
SALLY And Jerry? Be careful with it, okay? Be very careful.
JERRY Uh-huh.
FRANK George, as you may be aware, your mother and I are not moving to Del Boca Vista, Florida.
GEORGE I am aware.
FRANK So, I was wondering, would it be okay if I turned your room into a billiard parlor?
GEORGE A billiard parlor?
FRANK Regulation table, the hi-fi, maybe even a bar.. Give it real authenticity..
GEORGE Well, that's.. Elaine!
ELAINE Oh, hi, Frank.
GEORGE Sit down. Join us, please.
ELAINE Actually, I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing.
GEORGE Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down.
ELAINE Okay.. So.. Frank, did George ever show you that photo?
GEORGE What photo?
ELAINE You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said "Costanza"?
FRANK There's a Costanza in Tuscany? Did he look like me? Did you talk to him?
ELAINE I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it.
FRANK I gotta get that picture - it could be my cousin, Carlo.
ELAINE Who is that?
GEORGE When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind.
FRANK I played with him every day until the age of four - and then we separated.
ELAINE So, you weren't born here?
FRANK No. That's why I can never be president.. It always irked me. That's why, even at an early age, I had no interest in politics. I refuse to vote. They don't want me, I don't want them!
GEORGE I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas-
FRANK Don't bring me down. Do you have another copy of that photo?
ELAINE No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might.
FRANK The Maestro? What Maestro?
ELAINE He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him.
GEORGE Really? Why?
ELAINE Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars.
GEORGE Who?
ELAINE You know the Three Tenors?
GEORGE Yeah.. Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh.. the other guy.
ELAINE The other guy.
STEWARDESS Could I take that box for you?
JERRY Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it.
STEWARDESS Oh, then, I'll have to put your bag in the over-head.
JERRY Oh, okay..
STEWARDESS There we go.
JERRY Ohh.. look at this..
KRAMER What?
JERRY I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this stupid thing.
KRAMER Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still salvage some sauce..
JERRY I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin.
KRAMER I see..
JERRY No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and this was going to be my bit on the show.
KRAMER Well, why don't you do your material?
JERRY I'm out.
KRAMER Well, you better get to work.
JERRY Thanks for the tip.
GEORGE Hey, buddies.
JERRY Hey. Hey, this is for you. It's from.. uh, Susan's roommate, Sally.
GEORGE Oh yeah.. Sally called Susan - said you guys really hit it off.
JERRY Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box. What the hell are you doing?
KRAMER I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you?
JERRY Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.
KRAMER Jerry, why don't you do a bit on Styrofoam?
JERRY Like what?
KRAMER Well, uh.. "What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?"
JERRY Where's the punchline?
KRAMER It's all attitude..
GEORGE Well, this is certainly a crappy gift..
JERRY A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!
GEORGE Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's a big executive for Federal Express.
JERRY Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just ship it?!
KRAMER Look, it's personalized. "The Costanzas"
GEORGE No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it.
KRAMER Well, maybe your father would be interested in that.
GEORGE I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom.
KRAMER Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two..
KRAMER So, what's your game? What do you like to play?
FRANK Eight ball.
KRAMER No, nothing doing. Let's, you and me, play a game of straight pool.. hmm?
FRANK You like to gamble, Cosmo?
KRAMER Yeah, now and then - you know how it is..
FRANK Five dollars a game, huh?
KRAMER I'll break.
FRANK Okay.
GEORGE What's all this?
SUSAN Oh, I'm just moving in some more of my stuff.
GEORGE More stuff..
SUSAN Oh, I put up my doll collection..
GEORGE Oh my God! What is that?!
SUSAN What? What is it?
GEORGE This doll looks like my mother.
SUSAN George, it's a doll.
GEORGE I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother!
SUSAN Oh, get outta here..
ESTELLE What's going on in here? Are you two still playing?! You've been up here three hours!
FRANK We still haven't finished the first game.
ESTELLE The first game?!
KRAMER Well, we're still, uh, learning the subtleties of the table.
FRANK he knows the Maestro. He could have the picture..
ESTELLE Oh, forget about it. It's not your cousin.
FRANK You don't know that! We're gonna go see him, huh?
KRAMER As soon as the game is over..
FRANK Oh boy.
KRAMER Eleven, corner pocket.
GEORGE What is this thing doing here?
SUSAN Oh, I used to love to sleep with my dolls when I was a little girl..
GEORGE Uh, I'm sorry, I can't do this..
SUSAN Why?
GEORGE I feel like I'm in bed with my mother.
SUSAN Oh, stop it.
JERRY Hey, Elaine, you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush I just got - the Ori-dent.
ELAINE Oh yeah?
JERRY Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist!
ELAINE Oh, that's dynamite.
JERRY Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? You want to come see me on the Charles Grodin show?
ELAINE Who else is on the show?
JERRY Uh.. one of the three tenors.
ELAINE The Three Tenors? Which one?!
JERRY Uh.. It's not Poverotti.. It's not Domingo..
ELAINE The other guy?!
JERRY Yeah, the other guy.
ELAINE My God! I can't believe the other guy's going to be on the show!
JERRY Why?
ELAINE Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?
JERRY Why not?
ELAINE Wow! The other guy!
JERRY Hey, you look awful.
GEORGE I'm on no sleep, bro.
JERRY Problem in the bedroom?
GEORGE Susan has the doll collection.. one of the dolls looks exactly like my mother.. she likes to sleep with it.
JERRY Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night?
GEORGE ..Felt like it. I tell you, this doll is pretty spooky. It's freakin' me out man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat.
JERRY I thought you didn't want the doormat.
GEORGE I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow.
JERRY Sally? Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New York?
GEORGE Yeah, Susan said you'd be excited.
JERRY Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?!
ELAINE Who's Sally?
GEORGE Susan's college roommate.
JERRY It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show.
GEORGE So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll be delighted to talk to you.
JERRY I will - don't worry. In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap!
ELAINE That's sounds pretty juvenile.
JERRY Hey! A dinosaur!
FRANK His name was Carlo Costanza. We played together everyday until I was four. If I could just look through your photographs, maybe I could recognize him.
MAESTRO Unfortunately those photographs are at home.
KRAMER Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room.
FRANK Yes, It's, uh, it's.. uh, uh.. What do you call it, Kramer?
KRAMER A billiard room.
FRANK No, not billiard.. Not billiards.. it was.. Come on, already. Come on..
KRAMER What?
FRANK We call it.. the, uh..
KRAMER The Place To Be!
FRANK The place to be! Yes! It's the place to be.
MAESTRO Ah, then I shall be there. And now, Gentlemen, if you will excuse me - I must prepare for the symphony.
KRAMER Oh, yeah?
MAESTRO Ohh, my pants. It's an old conductor's trick I learned from Leonard Bernstein.
KRAMER Really?
MAESTRO You keep a perfect crease by not sitting in them before the performance.
KRAMER That's good thinking.
GEORGE You see?.. You see?!
JERRY Well, it doesn't look exactly like her.
GEORGE Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look like in ten years!
JERRY Why don't you just get rid of it?
GEORGE I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't do it. The guilt was too overwhelming. Susan's so attached to this thing.
JERRY Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home.
GEORGE Hi, Elaine.
ELAINE Did you see that?!
JERRY I'm just glad it's outta here. What's that?
ELAINE Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors.
JERRY Oh. Yeah?
SALLY It's Sally.
JERRY Oh, did you bring the bar-b-que sauce?
SALLY A whole case.
JERRY Excellent. So, did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about?
ELAINE No.
JERRY How come? I told you - It's fantastic.
ELAINE Eh, I like mine.
JERRY I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me?
ELAINE I don't want it.
JERRY I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better - it's much better.
ELAINE It doesn't matter to me.
JERRY Come in.
SALLY Well, here I am!
JERRY Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally.
ELAINE Hi.
JERRY How was your flight? Pretty uncomfortable?
SALLY Actually, the seat next to me was empty, so, there was no problem at all.
JERRY Oh.. Oh, wait.. This isn't the sauce that I asked for!
SALLY That's right. It's a special gourmet sauce. "The Pride of Memphis!"
JERRY No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!
SALLY This is much better. And frankly, in Memphis, we think that other sauce as kind of a joke.
JERRY I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing. Nothing!
SALLY You could just do your material.
JERRY I don't have any material!
ELAINE He's got nothin'!
DOLL Georgie! Don't eat with your hands! Why do you eat so fast?! You can't even taste it!
GEORGE Don't tell me how to eat!
DOLL You're wearing that shirt? You've had it for five years already! Why don't you get a new shirt?!
GEORGE Because I like this one! C'mon, let's go. Let's go! Oh, hi..
WOMAN That man should really be in a sanitarium.
KRAMER Now this is remarkable. I'm lounging, and yet, my pants remain perfectly creased.
FRANK It's him! It's Carlo Costanza!
KRAMER Come on. Are you sure?
FRANK I'd know him anywhere.
MAESTRO I've seen that man in Tuscany. Eccentric fellow. Reputation of being kind of a village idiot.
FRANK I still say we're related.
MAESTRO Ohh, I love this piece.
KRAMER Alright, come on Frank. It's your shot.
FRANK I can't make anything..
KRAMER Well, that's because you don't know how to follow through correctly.
FRANK Follow through? What do you mean?
KRAMER Right here, come on, I'll show you.. Take hold of your stick.. alright, bring it back slowly..
FRANK It's a little unnatural, but I think I'm getting the hang of it.
ESTELLE Oh, my God!
JERRY That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about.
ELAINE Well, have you ever considered writing new material?
JERRY Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done.
ELAINE Me? Are you talking about me?
JERRY No. You're never here.
ELAINE Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it?
JERRY Yeah. Really. Hey, you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show.
ELAINE What?
JERRY Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty funny. I'm gonna call them.
SALLY Hello?
JERRY Hello, Susan? It's Jerry.
SALLY Hi Jerry, it's Sally!
JERRY Oh. Is George there?
SALLY No, but he should be home soon.
JERRY Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her.
SALLY Is this for your comedy routine?
JERRY Yes.
SALLY Don't worry. I'm on the case.
MAESTRO I, uh, think I'll get some air.
KRAMER Yeah.. See? This is no good.. Hey, the baton. I got a hunch, fat man, I can't miss. 13 in the side pocket. Giddy-up. Six in the corner. This table's mine. You know where it's going..
ELAINE_AND_JERRY Hey!
ELAINE Is George here?
JERRY Not yet. The other guy.
ELAINE It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. Would you mind signing this poster for me?
CARRERAS My pleasure.
ELAINE Oh, thank you so much. Thank you so much, Mr.. Camaro. Mr. Casea? Well, whatever. I'm gonna take this to the Maestro. He's, he's playing at the Queens Convalescent Center.
JERRY Well, that's one hell of a gig. Hey, look, I got something for you. The Ori-dent!
ELAINE Ohh.. thank you. Huh.. Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box?
JERRY Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of packaging.
ELAINE How am I supposed to carry this thing? What are you doing?
JERRY Well, I want to sit down.
ELAINE So?
JERRY It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants.
MAESTRO Madame, you have been an extremely gracious hostess.
ESTELLE Ohh.. thank you, Maestro.
FRANK Here, take a look at this.
ESTELLE Yeah, what is it?
FRANK It's Carlo. I found him!
ESTELLE You've been cooped up in this room too long.
FRANK You never support me! Let's see what George says about this.. Where're my pants?
KRAMER Aw, beautiful!
SALLY Hey there, Mr. Hairy legs!
JERRY Where's George?
SALLY Don't worry, I brought your doll.. Tada!
JERRY No! That's the wrong doll!
SALLY Jerry, I saw the doll you were talking about - not funny! This doll's much funnier. Look, it has a little bowtie, and a cute little hat.. I think it's a riot!
JERRY This is a nightmare.
SALLY Oh well, I'll be watching. Don't screw up. Too much sauce..
JERRY My pants!
STAGEHAND Mr. Seinfeld, you're on.
MAESTRO Elaine? What a surprise.
ELAINE I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give you this.
MAESTRO Ohh.. Ori-dent - that electric toothbrush I've heard so much about..
ELAINE No, no, no. Not the toothbrush.. this.
MAESTRO Ohh, what a sweet gesture. And autographed poster of my favorite tenor, with.. those two other guys. Oh, Elaine, this is magnifico!
ELAINE Oh, well, I just felt so bad about what happened in Tuscany..
STAGEHAND Maestro, you're on!
MAESTRO Oh, Elaine.. wait for me after the concert? We'll celebrate.
ELAINE Oh, ok!
SUSAN I want to know why you took my doll out of the house.
GEORGE I just wanted a second opinion.
FRANK Take a look at this. Doesn't that look like my flesh and blood? Of course, your mother-
DOLL Oh, stop bothering everybody with that picture. It's ridiculous!
FRANK Ridiculous?! I'll show you ridiculous! Come here!
SUSAN No, Mr. Costanza! No, no!
FRANK There! Now what have you got to say for yourself?!
GEORGE I told you it looked like her..
FRANK Carlo! It's me, Frank! I'm your cousin, Frank! Aren't you Carlo?
MAN Carlo? No. Mi nome e Giuseppe.
FRANK What do you know.. Alright. I guess I was wrong.
JERRY What's this little scam the airlines have goin' now with these special clubs? Hundred fifty dollars a year to sit in a room, eat peanuts, drink coffee and soda, and read magazines. Excuse me, but isn't this the flight? I already got four hours of this comin' to me... What am I paying for? How bout' an 'I got all my luggage club'? Can I get into that club? Where is that club? I would like to join that club. Airlines love to divide us into classes. You know like when you're sitting in coach, the stewardess always closes that stupid curtain. Always gives you that look, like, maybe if you would work a little harder...
JERRY What time does your flight get in? Six? All right, that gives us six hours. Then I'll meet you at the diplomat's club. I'll be the one without the big red sash. Okay, see you tonight.
ELAINE Is that the supermodel?
JERRY Yep, she's not gonna be back for a month, but I got six hours.
ELAINE I thought you had a show in Ithaca.
JERRY I do, but it's three o'clock and then I'm flying right back and meeting Bridget at the Diplomat's Club in the airport.
ELAINE Well, guess what I'm doing. I'm going to Mr. Pitt's, and I am telling him that I am quitting.
JERRY So that's it? You know I never even met the guy.
ELAINE I've had enough. I am marchin' in.
JERRY You're marchin' in.
ELAINE I'm marchin'.
GEORGE Hey.
JERRY Hey. Elaine's quitting.
GEORGE Really?
ELAINE I'm marchin' in.
GEORGE I've done the march in. Best feeling in the world.
JERRY How 'bout the march out?
GEORGE Not as good. That's when you realize all the money you're losing.
ELAINE This is it. Wish me luck.
JERRY Get a march goin'! March it!
GEORGE Jerry, I need to borrow your camera.
JERRY Why?
GEORGE Well, I wanna put a picture of me and my boss Mr. Morgan up at the office.
JERRY What for?
GEORGE They're reorganizing the staff, and I'm on thin ice with this guy as it is.
JERRY Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent?
GEORGE It better be.
ELAINE Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you.
PITT One second Elaine.
ELAINE Mr. Pitt...
PITT Elaine, you know what I just did? I just amended my will to include you as a beneficiary.
ELAINE What?
PITT Well, I think of you as part of my family. You've come to be like a daughter to me and I want to make sure you're taken care of after I'm gone.
ELAINE Mr. Pitt...
PITT Elaine, I feel a cold coming on. Could you get me a cold pill from the medicine cabinet?
ELAINE Oh no no, Mr. Pitt, you mustn't. You have to check with the pharmacy before you combine anything with your heart medicine,
PITT Yes, yes, I'll check with the pharmacist.
ELAINE We don't want anything to happen to you Mr. Pitt. We want you to live a long, long time.
GEORGE Look at this, I only have one picture left... How 'bout a shot of me and Mr. Morgan?
MORGAN Why?
GEORGE Why? Because we're a team! C'mon! Would you take this for us, dear? Thank you very much. Here we go... Anyone ever tell you you look a lot like Sugar Ray Leonard? Yeah, you must get that all the time.
MORGAN I suppose we all look alike to you, right Costanza?
GEORGE No, not a racial thing, there really is a resemblance...
ELAINE Oh my God.
WOMAN Who are you?
PITT This is the girl I want to put in my will. Elaine...
MAN Please, rest Mr. Pitt.
WOMAN You're the assistant? Why weren't you taking care of him?
ELAINE Well, he gave me the morning off, I was doing a little... shopping. How did this happen?
MAN Took a very dangerous combination: prescription heart medicine and these other pills.
ELAINE Mr. Pitt, you were s'posed to talk with the pharmacist.
PITT I spoke to someone who worked there.
ELAINE I'm gonna go and call that pharmacist.
WOMAN How well do you know her?
KATIE Jerry, listen, just so you know, before we take off they're gonna tell us what to do in the vent of a crash-
JERRY Yes, I know. I've flown before.
KATIE Oh good. I just didn't want you to freak out... The chance of a crash is very slim. Do you have to go to the bathroom?
JERRY No.
KATIE Because even if you have to go a little you'd better go now because you won't get another chance until way after take off.
KRAMER Hey, how you doin'?
EARL Pretty good.
KRAMER Name's Kramer.
EARL Earl Hafler, nice to meet you. I'm headed to Houston, where you headed?
KRAMER Oh I'm happy right here. Isn't this place amazing? Planes flying in from all corners of the world, and they know the minute they're arriving.
EARL Ah they don't know a darn thing. That's why my flight the Houston's been delayed. They're all morons. Matter of fact, I'll bet you that that flight to Pittsburgh takes off before my flight to Houston.
KRAMER Bet? Um, not betting.
EARL Friendly wager.
KRAMER I haven't made a bet in three years, I-
EARL Ah c'mon. Keep things interesting, pass the time.
KRAMER Okay, how much?
EARL How 'bout 200?
KRAMER You're on, cowboy!
GEORGE How ya doin'?
MAN Okay.
GEORGE Nice day today.
MAN What?
GEORGE I'm George. George Costanza, you live around here?
INTERCOM Now arriving at gate 12...
EARL This could be Mexico City.
KRAMER C'mon Seattle, let's go.
EARL Come on, Mexico City!
KRAMER Seattle, yeah!
INTERCOM ...flight 42 from Mexico City.
KRAMER All right, c'mon, let's go again.
ELAINE Mr. Pitt, do you need anything?
PITT No.
ELAINE You need something to sit up. Why don't I get you a pillow?
PITT Okay.
KATIE It's a pretty full house, the lighting guy's name is Lew, he's got a birthday next week.
JERRY I don't care.
KATIE By the way, Jerry, I don't want you to freak out, but the pilot is going to be in the audience.
JERRY Who?
KATIE Remember the plane we took here? The pilot is gonna be sitting out there watching the show.
JERRY I don't care, why are you telling me this?
KATIE I just didn't want you to freak out when you saw him.
JERRY Why would I freak out? Pilot...
OFF_STAGE Ladies and gentlemen, a big hand for Mr. Jerry Seinfeld!
JERRY Hey, all right. Good afternoon Ithaca. Welcome, good to see you here... Boy, I'll tell you, there's an awful lot of those orange cones you have on the throughway... on the way... up here... um... I..
KATIE It didn't go very well, did it?
JERRY No, it didn't. And you know why? Seeing the pilot in the audience really freaked me out.
KATIE I knew it.
JERRY If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would have been fine. I became obsessed with him.
KATIE Why did we invite him? Stupid, stupid. when he asked for a ticket, I should have said no. I'm gonna go chew him out.
JERRY Oh, it doesn't matter now.
KATIE Don't worry, Jerry. I'm on top of this.
JERRY Yeah, you're on top of it, and I'm on the bottom!
EARL Well, Mr. Kramer, looks like you're in the hole $3200... Will that be cash or check?
KRAMER All right, look, one more bet. Double or nothing. C'mon.
EARL All right, but I wanna see some cash on the table.
KRAMER All right, let me call my bank. You stay here.
NEWMAN Hello?
KRAMER Yeah, it's, uh, me.
NEWMAN Hey, what's up?
KRAMER All right, listen. I need some cash.
NEWMAN What for?
KRAMER I just need it, that's all.
NEWMAN Oh no. Don't tell me. You're gambling again, aren't you? Oh you weak, weak man. Where are you?
KRAMER I'm at the airport.
NEWMAN The airport?
KRAMER We've been betting on arrivals and departures. But I'm down $3200 , so you've gotta get me some cash.
NEWMAN I don't have that kinda dough.
KRAMER Sure you do.
NEWMAN Oh no, no, not the bag!
KRAMER Oh help me man, I'm desperate!
NEWMAN All right, all right.
INTERCOM Sorry for the delay, folks, there is a slight complication that we're taking care of, and then we'll be on our way to La Guardia...
JERRY What is the complication?
FLIGHT_ATTENDANT Mr. Seinfeld?
JERRY Yes?
FLIGHT_ATTENDANT I'm sorry, but the pilot has asked that you leave this plane.
JERRY What?
FLIGHT_ATTENDANT Apparently, he has some sort of problem with you.
KATIE I'm not surprised. I really let him have it, Jerry. He has no business being in your audience if you didn't want him there.
JERRY I didn't care.
FLIGHT_ATTENDANT Well, now the pilot doesn't want you on his plane.
JERRY He can't just throw me off the plane!
FLIGHT_ATTENDANT Yes he can, if he has cause to believe a passenger will be a disturbance.
JERRY But I'm not a disturbance!
FLIGHT_ATTENDANT Well, apparently you are disturbing him, sir.
JERRY But someone is waiting for me!
KATIE Jerry, I don't want you to freak out.
JERRY I'm freakin' out! I am freakin' out!
KATIE There's a flight leaving at eight, and another one at eight-thirty, which one do you want?
JERRY Which one do you think I want?
KATIE The eight will get you in a little earlier.
JERRY Then we'll make it the eight.
KATIE I'll book a hotel, do you want a standard room or mini suite?
JERRY Hotel?
KATIE Yeah, it's eight in the morning.
JERRY No, no, no. I have to get home tonight. Bridget's gonna be waiting for me at the Diplomat's Club. Rent a car.
KATIE Mid-size, luxury, or sports model, what's your preference?
JERRY I don't have a preference, okay! Just make a decision yourself! Stop bothering me with every minor little detail, please?
KATIE Okay, you're a big celebrity.
GEORGE Yo.
JERRY George.
GEORGE Hey, Jerry, how was Ithaca?
JERRY I'm still here. Listen, you gotta go down to the Diplomat's Club...
GEORGE Hey, Jerry, what was the name of the exterminator who fumigated your apartment when you had fleas?
JERRY Carl, I think.
GEORGE Carl... Yeah, he was a nice guy.
JERRY Yeah, he was nice.
GEORGE What company was it?
JERRY Defent.
GEORGE Yeah, you know we spoke for a little bit...
JERRY You need an exterminator?
GEORGE No, not really.
JERRY Oh, don't tell me. 'Cause he's black?
GEORGE Gotta go.
JERRY George, George!
JERRY Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld. Is Elaine there?
WOMAN Hold on... Elaine, there's a Jerry Seinfeld on the phone for you.
ELAINE Hello?
JERRY Elaine, I need you to do me a big favor. I need you to go down to the Diplomat's Club and meet Bridget for me. I'm going to be late.
ELAINE That's at the airport, right?
JERRY Right, I don't want Bridget to think I stood her up. I'll never get another date with her. She'll freak out.
ELAINE All right, all right. You sound a little freaked out yourself.
JERRY I am a little freaked out!
ELAINE Calm down, I'll take care of it.
JERRY All right, but you have to go now.
ELAINE I said I'll take care of it!
NEWMAN Kramer.
KRAMER Hey.
NEWMAN Okay, here it is.
KRAMER Good. Here's my collateral.
EARL So it's a mailbag, so what?
NEWMAN So what? Do you know whose mailbag that is?
EARL David Berkowitz.
NEWMAN Son of Sam. The worst mass murderer the post office ever produced.
EARL Where did you get this?
NEWMAN I took over his route. And boy, were there a lot of dogs on that route.
EARL Any of 'em talk to you?
NEWMAN Just to tell me to keep off the snacks!
EARL Your buddy's a helluva guy.
KRAMER Yeah, don't I know it.
EARL Okay, Cosmo, we're back in business. Let's check out the board. Now, who do you like?
KRAMER All right, how 'bout Ithaca vs. Boston?
EARL All right, I'll give you a sportin' chance. I'll take Ithaca.
KRAMER Double or nothin'.
EARL Double or nothin'.
NEWMAN I hope you know what you're doing...
JERRY Where are we?
KATIE I'm not sure.
JERRY Is this even a road?
KATIE Oh we lost the road a half hour ago.
JERRY What? Why didn't you wake me up?
KATIE You told me not to bother you with minor details.
JERRY No, road is a major detail!
KATIE Okay, now I know. Should I keep going or turn around, do you have a preference?
JERRY Look out!
GEORGE May I help you?
CARL I'm the exterminator.
GEORGE Oh, yes of course, come in.
CARL Why didn't you want me to bring my equipment or wear my uniform?
GEORGE Yes, well, if the other people in the office saw that I called an exterminator, they would just panic. Besides, this is sort of a friendly visit. Carl, right?
CARL Do I know you?
GEORGE Yeah, sure, we met at Jerry Seinfeld's apartment. When you fumigated for fleas over there.
CARL Seinfeld... Oh yeah, funny white guy, right?
GEORGE Jerry? Yes, I suppose he is white. You know, I never really thought about it. I don't see people in terms of color. You know, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Hand on... Is Mr. Morgan in?
PHONE Mr. Morgan left for dinner.
GEORGE He left... huh... Carl, you hungry?
TV Here's a new twist on car pooling: Early this morning, a lost Manhattanite drove through a residential backyard and wound up in a swimming pool near Ithaca, New York. Comedian Jerry Seinfeld, a passenger, seemed a little freaked out.
JERRY That's it! No more questions! I don't care!
PITT That's him! That's the man who gave me the pills in the drug store! He's no pharmacist.
WOMAN Jerry Seinfeld... I know that name. He called here earlier for Elaine.
GEORGE Oh, by the way, order anything you want, it's all on me. Just do me a tiny favor: pretend we're old friends. Oh my God! Mr. Morgan! What a coincidence, it's Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan, I want you to meet a dear old friend of mine, Carl.
CARL I'm the exterminator.
GEORGE That's... what we used to call him in high school, the exterminator. He's a linebacker. Oh, did we have some wild times.
EARL Well, that Newman was your good luck charm.
KRAMER Yeah, he was.
EARL I should have quitted at double or nothin'. Travelers checks acceptable?
KRAMER Oh I accept.
NEWMAN ...yeah he worked in the cubicle right next to me. We once double dated.
KRAMER Yeah, it's a pleasure doin' business with a gentleman like yourself.
ELAINE Kramer.
KRAMER Oh hi Elaine. What are you doing here?
ELAINE Jerry asked me to meet his girlfriend here. Did you here about his plane in Ithaca?
EARL What about the plane in Ithaca?
ELAINE Oh, our stupid friend freaked out the pilot. Single handedly delayed the plane a whole hour. Can you believe that?
KRAMER Boy...
EARL Your friend caused the delay?
ELAINE Uh huh.
EARL You're a cheat! Nobody hustles Earl Hafler.
KRAMER C'mon!
EARL See you around, Cosmo.
KRAMER What?
ELAINE Poison you? Jerry Seinfeld tried to poison you? Wha? Mr. Pitt, what are you, delirious? He's never even met you!
PITT You're fired, Elaine. Goodbye.
ELAINE Goodbye?
JERRY Bridget!
BRIDGET Jerry, what happened?
JERRY Oh, I'm so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our whole time together.
BRIDGET Well, my plane doesn't leave for another half hour.
JERRY Really? Oh my God, that's him! That's the pilot!
GEORGE I love this place. You know, Carl and I come here all the time.
MORGAN Is that right?
CARL Yeah, I come here all the time. You wouldn't believe the rat problems in the kitchen.
MORGAN I thought so. You really are an exterminator. This time, George, you've sunk to a new low.
GEORGE Check, please.
WAITER Hey, Sugar Ray Leonard can eat here on the house.
GEORGE Mr. Morgan! Did you hear that? Mr. Morgan!
JERRY I've been watching women in the department stores. They're trying on clothes, and I've noticed that they do it differently from men. Women don't try on the clothes, they get behind the clothes, you see? They take a dress off the rack, and they hold it up against themself. They can tell something from this. They stick one leg way out 'cause they nedd to know, if some day I'm one-legged, and at a fourty-five degree angle, what am I gonna wear? You never see a man do that. You never see a guy take a suit off the rack, put his head in the neck, and go, "What do you think about this suit? I think I'll get it. Yeah, it looks fine. Put some shoes by the bottom of the pants, I wanna make sure. Yeah, perfect. And what if I'm walking? Move the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes.
JERRY What are you doing? All right, all right. What's the matter with that? What about that one?
ELAINE Robert Vaughn, The Helsinki Formula?
JERRY He was good in Man From Uncle.
ELAINE Guess whose birthday's comin' up soon?
JERRY I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.
ELAINE Oh, right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious. Hey, look at naked people.
JERRY No, I don't wanna see the naked people.
ELAINE Been a while?
JERRY I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago.
ELAINE I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot shorter.
JERRY I remember that it's a good thing. Someday, I hope to do it again.
ELAINE What?
JERRY What?
ELAINE What was that look?
JERRY What look?
ELAINE The look you just gave me.
JERRY I gave a look?
ELAINE Yes.
JERRY What kind of look?
ELAINE I know that look.
JERRY Then what was it?
ELAINE Why should I tell you?
JERRY Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are.
ELAINE Trust me. I know the look. So...
JERRY What?
ELAINE What about the look?
JERRY I don't know.
ELAINE You got something on your mind?
JERRY No. Things pop into your head. You?
ELAINE Things occur to me from time to time.
JERRY Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely.
ELAINE No, of course not.
JERRY I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? Twenty-five times?
ELAINE Thirty-seven.
JERRY Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there.
ELAINE We know the terrain.
JERRY No big surprises.
ELAINE Nope.
JERRY What do you think?
ELAINE I don't know. What do you think?
JERRY Well, it's something to consider.
ELAINE Yeah.
JERRY I mean, let's say we did.
ELAINE What if.
JERRY Is that like the end of the world or something?
ELAINE Certainly not.
JERRY Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?
ELAINE I know.
JERRY I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated.
ELAINE It's almost stupid if we didn't.
JERRY It's moronic.
ELAINE Absurd!
JERRY Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.
ELAINE We, there are always a few.
JERRY I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad.
ELAINE Devastating.
JERRY Because this is very good.
ELAINE And that would be good.
JERRY That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed.
ELAINE Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that.
JERRY But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something.
ELAINE Huh.
JERRY For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa.
ELAINE Right.
JERRY But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.
ELAINE Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that.
JERRY Beautiful. Let's make it a rule.
ELAINE All right, sir.
JERRY Now here's another little rule. When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.
ELAINE Okay, okay. Spending the night is optional!
JERRY Well now we're gettin' somewhere.
ELAINE What about the kiss goodnight?
JERRY Tough one. You're call.
ELAINE It's brug-wa .
JERRY Fine. Well.
ELAINE Well.
JERRY You ready?
ELAINE Ready.
JERRY So think you can handle this?
ELAINE Definitely.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER Got the paper?
JERRY Not yet.
KRAMER No paper?
JERRY I haven't been out yet.
KRAMER Well, what's taking you so long? Uh? Oh, well, yeah...
GEORGE What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water?
JERRY No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's the job situation goin'?
GEORGE Still lookin'. It's pretty bad out there. What about you?
JERRY Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night.
GEORGE Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major.
JERRY I thought you'd like that.
GEORGE Oh, this is huge!
JERRY I know.
GEORGE All right, okay. Let's go, details.
JERRY No, I can't do details.
GEORGE You wha?
JERRY I can't give details.
GEORGE No details?
JERRY I'm not in the mood.
GEORGE You ask me to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you get in the mood!
JERRY All right, okay. We're in the apartment watching TV.
GEORGE Where are you sitting?
JERRY On the couch.
GEORGE Next to each other?
JERRY No, separated.
GEORGE Time?
JERRY About eleven.
GEORGE Okay, go ahead.
JERRY So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station.
GEORGE Oh, see? that's why I don't have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. So you're watching the naked station.
JERRY And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.
GEORGE Boy, these are really bad details.
JERRY It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details.
GEORGE Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates me.
JERRY Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate.
GEORGE Better than before?
JERRY She must've taken some kind of seminar or something.
GEORGE This is all too much. So what are you feeling? What's going on? Are you like a couple again now?
JERRY Not exactly.
GEORGE Not exactly. What does that mean?
JERRY Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends.
GEORGE Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? It's impossible. It can't be done. Thousands of years people have been trying to have their cake and eat it too. So all of a sudden the two of you are going to come along and do it. Where do you get the ego? No one can do it. It can't be done.
JERRY I think we've worked out a system.
GEORGE Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.
JERRY No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by advancing all of the relationship pitfalls.
GEORGE Sure, all right. Tell me the rules.
JERRY Okay. No calls the next day.
GEORGE So you're havin' the sex, next day you don't have to call. That's pretty good. Go ahead.
JERRY You ready for the second one?
GEORGE I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one.
JERRY Spending the night. Optional.
GEORGE No, you see? You got greedy.
JERRY No, that's the rule. It's optional.
GEORGE I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. I could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide You're not going anywhere.
JERRY I think you're wrong.
GEORGE I hope I am.
JERRY Is this yours or the roommate's?
ELAINE The roommate's.
JERRY Would she mind?
ELAINE She keeps track of everything.
JERRY Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm takin' it.
ELAINE Thanks.
JERRY Well, guess I'll get going.
ELAINE Oh.
JERRY Well, I have that root canal tomorrow morning. It'll be easier if I go home.
ELAINE Fine, go away.
JERRY I don't understand. Is there a problem? I'm getting the impression there's a problem.
ELAINE Just go.
JERRY I'm having surgery tomorrow.
ELAINE Oh, surgery. You're going to the dentist.
JERRY But you said, it can be very serious.
ELAINE Okay, so fine. Go.
JERRY What happened to the rules? Remember? Sleeping over was optional.
ELAINE Yeah, it's my house, it's my option.
JERRY It has nothing to do with whose house it is.
ELAINE Oh, of course it does.
TINA Hi. ELAINE +
JERRY Hi.
TINA Hi, Jerry.
JERRY Hi.
TINA Such a great improv class tonight.
ELAINE Oh really?
TINA I had this improv where I pretended I was working in one of those booths. You know, in the amusement park, where you have to shoot the water in the clown's mouth and you have to blow up the balloon.
ELAINE Uh, Tina? Could you excuse us for just one second?
TINA Oh, yeah. I'll excuse you.
ELAINE What are you doing?
JERRY I can't go if you're mad.
ELAINE I'm not mad.
JERRY You seemed a little mad.
ELAINE No, no. Jerry, I'm fine really. It's okay.
JERRY So you're okay with everything?
ELAINE Definitely. Are you?
JERRY Definitely. Well, goodnight.
ELAINE Goodn-- What're you doing?
JERRY What?
ELAINE Rules.
TINA Hey, who took my cake?
GEORGE What about jewelry? That's very nice gift.
JERRY No, no. I have to be very careful here. I don't want to send the wrong message. Especially after the other night.
GEORGE Maybe I'll get her some jewelry.
JERRY No, no. You can't get her anything better than me. Whatever I spend, you have to spend half.
GEORGE What am I supposed to get, a bazooka?
JERRY You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it.
GEORGE What does she need? Maybe there's something that she needs.
JERRY I think I heard her say something about a bench.
GEORGE A bench? What kind of a bench?
JERRY I don't know, but she mentioned a bench.
GEORGE What, like at a bus stop?
JERRY I don't know.
GEORGE Like a park bench?
JERRY I have no idea.
GEORGE Who puts a bench in their house?
JERRY Forget the bench.
GEORGE I got it. You wanna get her something nice? How 'bout a music box?
JERRY No, too relationshippy. She opens it up, she hears that Laura's theme, I'm dead.
GEORGE Okay, what about a nice frame? With a picture of another guy in it. Frame says I care for you, but if you wanna get serious, perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this.
JERRY Nice looking fellow.
GEORGE What about candle holders?
JERRY Too romantic.
GEORGE Lingerie?
JERRY Too sexual.
GEORGE Waffle maker.
JERRY Too domestic.
GEORGE Bust of Nelson Rockefeller.
JERRY Too Gubernatorial.
GEORGE Let's work on the card.
JERRY Maybe you won't like it.
ELAINE Oh, how could I not like it? Of course I'll like it.
JERRY You could not like it.
ELAINE Just the fact that you remembered means everything.
JERRY Of course I remembered. You reminded me everyday for two months. Oh, the card.
ELAINE Cash?
JERRY Would do you think?
ELAINE You got me cash?
JERRY Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. No good?
ELAINE Who are you, my uncle?
JERRY Well come on. That's $182 right there. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at.
ELAINE Let me see the card. To a wonderful girl, a great pal, and more?
KRAMER Hey. Oh, Elaine. I'm glad you're here. Stay right there. I'm gonna be right back.
ELAINE Pal? You think I'm your pal?
JERRY I said, "and more."
ELAINE I am not your pal.
JERRY What's wrong with pal? Why is everyone so down on pal?
ELAINE Oh, what is this? You got me something?
KRAMER Yeah. Open it.
ELAINE Oh Kramer... The bench! You got me the bench that I wanted!
KRAMER That's pretty good, huh?
JERRY Great.
KRAMER Remember when we were standing there and she mentioned it? I made a mental note of it.
JERRY Well goody for you.
KRAMER Oh yeah, I'm very sensitive about that. I mean, when someone's birthday comes up, I keep my ears open. So what'd you get her?
JERRY 182 bucks.
KRAMER Cash? You gotta be kidding. What kind of gift is that? That's like something her uncle would get her.
ELAINE Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such a friend.
KRAMER Yates.
ELAINE Oh Kramer.
JERRY Could you excuse us please?
KRAMER What?
JERRY We're talking.
KRAMER Oh, the relationship.
JERRY You know, we never had one fight before this deal.
ELAINE I know.
JERRY Never.
ELAINE Ever.
JERRY We got along beautifully.
ELAINE Like clams.
JERRY It was wonderful.
ELAINE A pleasure.
JERRY So I think we should just forget the whole deal, and go back to being friends.
ELAINE I can't do it.
JERRY You what?
ELAINE I can't do that.
JERRY You mean it's... No this. No that. No this or that. Oh, boy. What do you want?
ELAINE This, that, and the other.
JERRY Oh, sure. Of course, you're entitled. Who doesn't want this, that, and the other?
ELAINE You.
JERRY Well...
GEORGE Those birthdays. I told you. They're relationship killers. If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday will always bring it out.
JERRY I never should have made up those rules.
GEORGE What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is it the touching? Is it the nudity?
JERRY It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.
GEORGE You know what this means? I can't see her anymore either.
JERRY Why?
GEORGE It's break up by association. Besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present.
JERRY What did you end up giving her?
GEORGE 91 dollars.
JERRY Sorry about that.
GEORGE So what're you gonna do?
JERRY Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore. This is pretty much it.
GEORGE So, maybe this should be it.
JERRY Could be it.
GEORGE She seems like an it.
JERRY She's at it as you get. Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. And she tells me he's a sculptor, they live in Vermont...
GEORGE We'd have to kill him.
JERRY We'd get caught, I'd get the chair.
GEORGE I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people.
JERRY Plus, you know what else.
GEORGE You better call her.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER You got the paper yet?
JERRY Yeah.
KRAMER Well where is it? Hey, you done with that?
ELAINE No.
KRAMER Well, you're not reading it now.
ELAINE All right, you can take it. But I want it back.
KRAMER Oh yeah. So, ah, what're you guys gonna do today?
ELAINE Ah, this. And that.
JERRY And the other.
KRAMER Boy, I really liked the two of you much better when you weren't a couple.
GEORGE Wait a second, wait a second...and then the butler says, "I'm not cleanin' it up! I'm sick of cleaning!"
JERRY That's funny, that's funny! "I'm sick of cleaning." That's very funny.
GEORGE I've never seen a pilot script as funny as this!
JERRY Yeah, it's funny!
GEORGE I mean, how funny is this?
JERRY It's funny.
GEORGE I mean, we're not stupid, right? We know when something's funny!
JERRY It cannot not be funny! Now come on, let's stay with it, we gotta finish this today.
GEORGE Okay. Hey, you know what, maybe I should give it to my therapist to read. She's smart, I trust her.
JERRY Yeah, maybe I'll give it to Elaine.
GEORGE Hey, you know, we haven't brought the Elaine character into the show yet. We should try and get her into this scene.
JERRY Right, right. Okay. Elaine enters. What does she say...?
GEORGE I don't know, what do women say?
JERRY I don't know.
GEORGE I don't even know what they think. That's why I'm in therapy.
JERRY You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's going to be so many people to keep track of. It's gonna be too hard, I'll forget where everybody's standing, you, me, Kramer, the butler, it's too much.
GEORGE Alright, forget Elaine.
JERRY Alright.
KRAMER Hey.
GEORGE Hey.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER You are never gonna believe who I just ran into today.
JERRY Who?
KRAMER Your old flame. Gail Cunningham.
JERRY Did you talk to her?
KRAMER Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me? I didn't know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with her and she wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now I'm thinking, what is my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I ignore her? I mean, what is my responsibility here?
JERRY So what happened?
KRAMER Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes, "Oh, hi! Kramer!" You know? Like nothing happened! Like she never went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight.
JERRY Yeah, I know about the three dates.
KRAMER You know what I did? I snubbed her.
JERRY What do you mean, you snubbed her?
KRAMER I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word.
JERRY Right by her?
KRAMER Right by her!
JERRY What you do say about a guy like this, huh! You are some great friend, I tell ya, snubbed her! Not that I condone it. I've never condoned snubbing in my administration. Your loyalty is beyond question.
KRAMER Yeah. Well, you know, she was lucky I was in a good mood - coulda been a lot worse. New scene - Jerry and Elaine at the coffee shop. Jerry is showing her the script.
ELAINE I'm not even in here!
JERRY Yeah, I know.
ELAINE I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes.
JERRY Well, there were too many people in the room, we couldn't keep track of everybody. George, and the butler, and...
ELAINE You couldn't "keep track" of everybody?
JERRY Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh... ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have no idea what it is.
ELAINE You have no idea?
JERRY Something derogatory?
GAIL I thought I'd find you here.
JERRY Well, Gail Cunningham.
ELAINE Hi, Gail.
GAIL Hi, Elaine. Hey, what is with your friend Kramer?
JERRY Why?
GAIL He snubbed me.
JERRY Are you sure?
GAIL Yeah, I'm sure. What did you tell him?
JERRY Nothing. Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that.
ELAINE I thought you were finished.
JERRY I took two bites, how am I finished? Plus you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick? Bite?
GAIL So, how come? Why did Kramer do that?
JERRY I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction.
GAIL Well, tell him that I am mad at him.
JERRY Alright. So, where ya cookin' now?
GAIL Pfeiffer's.
JERRY Ah, the power lunch crowd.
GAIL Nice shoes!
ELAINE Oh. Thank you.
GAIL Where'd you get 'em?
ELAINE They're um, Botticelli's.
GAIL Ooh, Botticelli's! Look at you! I'm afraid to go in there.
ELAINE Really.
JERRY Would you care to join us?
GAIL No, no, I gotta get to the restaurant. Oh! See ya.
JERRY See ya.
ELAINE "Oh, look at you, the Botticelli's."
JERRY That bothered you?
ELAINE Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me.
JERRY It did?
ELAINE Yes! Couldn't you see that?
JERRY No. This is why you're not in the pilot. New scene - George in a session with Dana, his therapist.
DANA Well, George, I think you're beginning to get some perspective on things. I think we're making progress.
GEORGE Yeah, I feel like I've grown.
DANA Good. So, let's pick up on this next week.
GEORGE Great. Oh, by the way, did you get a chance to read the script?
DANA Yes, yes I did.
GEORGE Well, what'd you think?
DANA Uh...it was...good.
GEORGE You didn't like it?
DANA Well, no, I -
GEORGE I can't believe this! What was wrong with it? What didn't you like about it?
DANA It wasn't funny.
GEORGE It wasn't funny? What, are you kidding?
DANA No, I didn't find it funny.
GEORGE You didn't find it funny?! This is what I'm paying for?
DANA Well, that whole storyline about a guy who gets into a car accident, doesn't have any insurance, so the judge sentences him to be a butler? I didn't really buy that.
GEORGE Let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...we pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon.
DANA George, if you're going to be in a creative field, you're going to have to learn how to deal with criticism.
GEORGE How's this for criticism? Um...you stink. How do like that criticism? You know what's funny to me? That diploma up on the wall. That is my idea of "com-med-dee"! You sitting here, telling people what to do.
DANA I think you'd better go.
GEORGE Oh, I'm goin' baby. I'm goin.' It's Jerry's fault. He took out all my good lines. He's such a control freak! New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment. They're both standing by the door. Elaine enters.
GEORGE So, you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders, and she criticizes our script. What kind of a therapist is that?
ELAINE I guess she didn't think it was funny.
GEORGE Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What is she, Rowan & Martin? We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely shattered my confidence. And I'm paying for this, she's my employee!
JERRY I thought your mother's paying for it.
GEORGE And she slaves to earn every penny. So that someday, I might be able to walk up to a woman and say, "Yes, I'm bald, but I'm still a good person."
JERRY You know, he's right. It's not her place to criticize the script, which reminds me - what did you think of it? You never told me.
ELAINE What did I think of it?
KRAMER Hey, buddy, I got something to tell ya.
JERRY Hey, one second, you don't get off that easy. C'mon, tell me what you thought.
ELAINE Well, you know, I...
KRAMER I just kissed Gail Cunningham.
JERRY You what?
KRAMER Yeah, I kissed her.
JERRY You kissed her?
KRAMER Right on the mouth.
JERRY What kinda great friend are you? How do you go from snubbing to kissing?
KRAMER Well, I saw her outside the Y, you know, she came up to me, she started yelling because I snubbed her, and then we started talking a little bit, and I walked her to her building. And just before I left, I put my arm around her waist, I pulled her to me, and I - mmm - I planted one!
JERRY And what did she do?
KRAMER She kissed me back.
JERRY I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you?
KRAMER Because I snubbed her. You see? Women, they like that! Yes! I understand women. The snub is good, they love the snub!
GEORGE No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased.
KRAMER Ooh, so...I understand you're buying new shoes now at Botticelli's.
ELAINE What? Who told you that?
KRAMER Gail Cunningham.
ELAINE I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? Why are my shoes a topic of conversation?
KRAMER Well, you know, we were just talking, and she mentioned how you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.
ELAINE "How I'm buying my shoes now at Botticelli's!" Did you hear this?
JERRY So what?
ELAINE So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes! New scene - Gail cooking in the kitchen at Pfeiffer's Restaurant. Elaine marches in.
ELAINE Hey! Gail!
GAIL Elaine...!
ELAINE Why are you talking about my shoes?
GAIL What?
ELAINE My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes.
GAIL What are you talking about?
ELAINE Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's?
WAITER Too spicy. He wants another one. You got that pasta primavera?
GAIL Look Elaine, I am very busy here.
ELAINE Who else have you mentioned my shoes to, huh? I wanna know why my footwear is your conversation!
GAIL I am not discussing this. This is insane.
WAITER You got that pasta primavera? Let's go! Here you are, Mr. Dalrymple.
RUSSELL Thank you.
WAITER Sorry for the delay. Enjoy your lunch. New scene - Jerry and George arrive at Dalrymple's apartment to discuss the script.
RUSSELL Well, come in. Awfully sorry to make you come up here, but I really wasn't feeling well enough to go back to the office, and well, it's the only chance I have to meet with you this week.
JERRY Are you alright?
RUSSELL Well, it's my stomach. I think there must have been something in the pasta primavera I had for lunch.
JERRY Where did you eat?
RUSSELL Pfeiffer's.
JERRY Ah. I know the chef there.
RUSSELL Yeah. The food's usually terrific.
GEORGE My cousin worked for Bouchard's. They used to use the bouilla-base for a toilet.
RUSSELL What are you saying?
GEORGE Well, you didn't hear it from me, but needless to say, if you go in there - stick with the consumee.
RUSSELL Well, we'd better get started, my daughter's going to be here soon.
JERRY Oh, you have a daughter?
RUSSELL Yeah, she just turned fifteen last week.
GEORGE Aw, that's a fun age.
RUSSELL Alright. The script. Now, I've read this thing three times...and everytime I read it...
JERRY What?
RUSSELL Excuse me for a second.
GEORGE Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet...! Do you think he liked it?
JERRY I'm not sure. What was that dish he said he had...?
GEORGE Pasta primavera.
JERRY Ah. You know, 'primavera' is Italian for 'spring.'
GEORGE No!
JERRY Yeah.
RUSSELL Really, I'm terribly sorry, it just, uh...all of a sudden it just hit me.
GEORGE So, you were saying how, um...about the script...
RUSSELL Right. The script. Your script needs some...it needs, um...
GEORGE More jokes?
JERRY Another ending?
GEORGE A different name for the butler?
JERRY Maybe we should go.
GEORGE We haven't heard his notes yet, we don't know how he feels about our work.
RUSSELL Oh God. Oh my god.
JERRY I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there.
MOLLY Hello.
JERRY Hi.
GEORGE Hi.
MOLLY I'm Molly.
JERRY I'm Jerry.
GEORGE George.
JERRY We're here discussing our script with your father.
GEORGE He just read it.
MOLLY Daddy? Are you okay?
RUSSELL Yeah, sweetie. I'm fine.
GEORGE So, you live with your mother, huh?
MOLLY Uh, yeah.
GEORGE Divorce is very difficult. Especially on a kid. Of course, I'm the result of my parents having stayed together, so you never know.
MOLLY Daddy, are you alright? What's the matter?
RUSSELL It's just a stomach thing.
MOLLY Yuck.
RUSSELL We're going to have to do this some other time, so if you'll give me your number, I'll call you later.
GEORGE You know, suddenly I'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself.
RUSSELL Get a good look, Costanza? New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.
JERRY What were you doing?
GEORGE Well, it's not my fault. You poked me!
JERRY You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building.
GEORGE It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. What am I, waiting to win an Oscar here? This is all I have in my life.
JERRY Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away.
GEORGE All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? She's got nice cleavage.
JERRY That's why I poked.
GEORGE That's why I peeked.
GAIL Hey! What is with your friend Elaine?
JERRY What?
GAIL She comes to my restaurant, comes right in my kitchen, and starts complaining that I'm talking about her shoes.
KRAMER Right in the kitchen. Disgraceful.
GAIL I don't want people coming into my kitchen. I think she might have sneezed all over someone's pasta primavera. Someone might have gotten sick because of her.
GEORGE Pasta primavera?
JERRY Is that what she said?
KRAMER She's somethin', huh? She's a wild one. She's wearin' me out.
JERRY She is?
KRAMER She's sensual. You know, with the...cooking and all.
JERRY Hello? Oh, hi Stu.
GEORGE From NBC?
JERRY Yeah. What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot. Commercial break. New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.
JERRY If you hadn't gone into her restaurant, this never would have happened.
ELAINE Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway!
GEORGE He poked me!
JERRY There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex - - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke...
ELAINE But she was fifteen.
JERRY You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level, you can't control it! We're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head.
GEORGE Alright, what's the difference. What are we gonna do now? He won't take our calls, we can't get into his office...
JERRY You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him.
GEORGE Hey, now you're onto something.
JERRY The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.
GEORGE Yeah. Well, maybe not Elaine, but...somebody like Gail, though.
ELAINE What? What do you mean, Gail?
KRAMER Yah-hey.
JERRY Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me.
KRAMER Alright, I'll call her right now.
ELAINE What do you mean, Gail? You don't think I can attract attention? You don't think I can put asses in the seats?
JERRY Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it...
KRAMER She said she'll do it.
JERRY Beautiful.
KRAMER But she wants the shoes.
ELAINE What?
KRAMER She says she wants those shoes.
ELAINE She wants my shoes? What kind of person is this? Alright! She is not getting 'em!
JERRY No, come on! I'll buy you another pair!
ELAINE No, these were the last pair of these that they had!
JERRY I'll get you another one just like it!
ELAINE No, but these were the only really cool ones like this! Don't you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em?
GEORGE Elaine, this pilot...it doesn't matter to me, it's not me I'm concerned about...it's my mother. I've been over to the hospital to see her...
ELAINE Oh yeah, because she caught you jer -
GEORGE Never mind!
ELAINE Oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. How do I even know she wears the same size?
KRAMER Alright, what size are you?
ELAINE Seven-and-a-half.
KRAMER Eh! Bingo. New scene - Gail in the kitchen at Pfeiffer's. She notices Dalrymple being shown to his table.
GAIL Sauce this. Yeah, he's here. Oh, and one more thing...bring the shoes. Continuation of last scene - Russell eating at the restaurant. Jerry and George arrive. Jerry hands the shoes to Gail, and they walk over to Russell's table.
JERRY Hey! Whattaya know!
GEORGE Look who's here!
JERRY Fancy meeting you here!
RUSSELL Oh. Hello.
GEORGE Pasta primavera! Back on the horse.
JERRY You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you.
GEORGE Didn't hear anything...
JERRY Didn't know...we were wondering...what happened.
RUSSELL It just didn't seem to be the right project for us right now. So, what were you saying?
GEORGE Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer. Did I leer?
JERRY No leer.
ELAINE Excuse me, are you using that ketchup?
RUSSELL Uh, no.
GEORGE Because, if I'm looking straight ahead, and something enters my field of vision, that's merely a happenstance.
RUSSELL Under the circumstances, I don't really feel that we should be in business together.
ELAINE Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any trouble?
RUSSELL No.
ELAINE Do you have a...ketchup secret?
RUSSELL No, I... ...don't have a ketchup secret.
ELAINE Because if you do have a ketchup secret, I would really, really like to know what it is.
RUSSELL Field of vision, huh? Commercial break. New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine having dinner at Pfeiffer's. Gail comes over to the table.
GAIL How's everything?
ELAINE Mmmm.
JERRY Really good.
GEORGE This pasta primavera is fabulous.
JERRY Very tasty.
GAIL How'd everything go with that NBC guy?
GEORGE Great.
JERRY The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night. Listen, Elaine, if Russell mentions anything about the pilot, you'll of course tell him how much you liked it...?
ELAINE You know, I happen to have the script right here with me and, uh...on page 3, for example, suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing a...a low-cut dress. And the butler is very distracted, and can't work.
JERRY Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us.
ELAINE Well, I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.
GEORGE Well, it's a funny idea.
JERRY It's funny!
GEORGE C'mon, funny is funny.
JERRY Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, right?
ELAINE Well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night.
JERRY If you can.
GEORGE Yeah. Where's he taking you, by the way?
ELAINE Bouchard's, on 53rd.
JERRY I think what he's trying to say is, "get the bouilla-base."
JERRY So, I fly a lot. I like planes. I was on a plane the other day and I was wondering - are there keys to the plane? Do they need keys to start the plane? Maybe that's what those delays on the ground are sometimes. When you're just sitting there at the gate, maybe the pilot's just up there in the cockpit going "Oh, I don't believe this. Oh my god...I did it again." They tell you it's something mechanical, because they don't want to come on the PA system..."Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be delayed here on the ground for a little while, I uh...Oh God, this is so embarrassing...I - I left the keys to the plane in my apartment." You see the technicians all running underneath the plane; you think they're servicing it, but they're actually looking for the magnet "hide-a-key" under the wing..."maybe he left it up there somewhere..."
JERRY What is it about sleep that makes you so thirsty? Do dreams require liquid? It's not like I'm running a marathon, I'm just lying there.
JERRY What the hell...? Why is the door open?
JERRY Kramer, what are you doing here!?
KRAMER Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! Y'know, I was watching "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo," and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper.
JERRY You scared me!
KRAMER It's just me.
JERRY That's enough!
KRAMER Forgot the popper...
JERRY C'mon...c'mon...
JERRY Kramer! What are you doing?!
KRAMER What does it look like I'm doing? What?
JERRY Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go!
KRAMER Alright, alright...
JERRY C'mon!
KRAMER Sorry.
JERRY Move it! Move it! Get going!
KRAMER My drain's all clogged up!
JERRY Is that my towel?
GIRLFRIEND I'm really happy the movie was sold out.
JERRY Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment?
GIRLFRIEND I'm from Witchita, so...
JERRY Oh. I see. There he is!
GIRLFRIEND Hurry, Jerry! He's coming! Hurry!
JERRY The murderers!
GIRLFRIEND That was close!
JERRY Did you see the look on that guy's face?
GIRLFRIEND You were so fast with those keys.
JERRY Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!
KRAMER Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies.
JERRY All right, that's it. Hand 'em over.
KRAMER What?
JERRY What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your key privileges.
KRAMER Oh, come on!
JERRY No, come on!
KRAMER What, what, I thought you went to the movies!
JERRY It was sold out!
KRAMER Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?
JERRY That's the point.
KRAMER What point?
JERRY Just, look, just give the keys.
KRAMER Just give me another chance!
JERRY Don't ask me!
KRAMER I'm asking you!
JERRY I'm telling you.
KRAMER You're joking.
JERRY I'm serious!
KRAMER It's not going to happen again!
JERRY Yes it will, now give me those keys!
KRAMER O.K., fine, go ahead, you take the keys! But you're going to regret this.
JERRY So put 'em in a safe place.
ELAINE I will.
JERRY Where?
ELAINE I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?
JERRY I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.
ELAINE Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.
JERRY I can't.
ELAINE Is that Kramer?
JERRY Who's there?
KRAMER Uh, Kramer. Oh, hi...uh...you got the...
ELAINE Oh, I'm not, uh...
KRAMER No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke "the covenant of the keys."
ELAINE Jerry, give him the keys back.
JERRY Elaine...
KRAMER I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. To float. And I thank you.
JERRY Take the keys.
KRAMER I don't want the keys!
JERRY O.K.!
O.K.! KRAMER
KRAMER Now, one more thing - I would like my keys back.
JERRY Your spare set?
KRAMER That's right.
JERRY You want 'em back?
KRAMER Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best.
GEORGE Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say.
KRAMER Say yes! Yes, George. Yes!
GEORGE Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys.
KRAMER Well, you can get 'em back.
GEORGE I suppose I could.
KRAMER Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.
GEORGE Me?
KRAMER Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George.
GEORGE Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out.
WAITRESS Hi, are you ready to order?
KRAMER Do you ever yearn?
GEORGE Yearn? Do I yearn?
KRAMER I yearn.
GEORGE You yearn.
KRAMER Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you yearned?
GEORGE Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant craving...but I haven't yearned.
KRAMER Look at you.
GEORGE Aw, Kramer, don't start...
KRAMER You're wasting your life.
GEORGE I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my life!
KRAMER O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?
GEORGE No.
KRAMER You got money?
GEORGE No.
KRAMER Do you have a woman?
GEORGE No.
KRAMER Do you have any prospects?
GEORGE No.
KRAMER You got anything on the horizon?
GEORGE Uh...no.
KRAMER Do you have any action at all?
GEORGE No.
KRAMER Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning?
GEORGE I like to get the Daily News!
KRAMER George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little boys.
GEORGE Why?
KRAMER I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug.
GEORGE Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.
KRAMER No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie.
GEORGE "These pretzels are making me thirsty"? That was one line! You got fired!
KRAMER I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you coming with me?
GEORGE Uh, no, I'm not.
KRAMER Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're key brothers now.
GEORGE You're not really gonna go to California, are you?
KRAMER Up here, I'm already gone.
GEORGE Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so I need mine back from you.
ELAINE Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?
GEORGE I don't know. He said he wants to be my "key brother."
ELAINE That's ridiculous.
GEORGE That's Kramer.
ELAINE I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.
GEORGE What for?
ELAINE 'Cause. I'll give 'em to Jerry.
GEORGE Jerry? Why?
ELAINE 'Cause he gave me his.
GEORGE So what?
ELAINE So, if he has my keys, I should have his.
GEORGE Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours.
ELAINE I just said the same thing to you.
GEORGE What?
ELAINE What?
GEORGE Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?
ELAINE Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. What are you doing? Would you just put that down? I gotta get some new friends.
JERRY Did you bring the keys?
GEORGE Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.
JERRY This could be an emergency!
GEORGE You never should have taken away his keys!
JERRY I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em.
GEORGE How'd the Mets do?
JERRY They lost.
JERRY Kramer?
NEWMAN Hello, boys.
JERRY Hello, Newman.
NEWMAN You lookin' for someone?
JERRY Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!
NEWMAN Coy? I'm not being coy.
JERRY Is he being coy?
GEORGE Yeah, coy.
JERRY You're being coy. Now where's Kramer, Newman?
NEWMAN Who?
JERRY Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!
NEWMAN Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses.
JERRY Turn around, George.
GEORGE Sure.
NEWMAN George?
JERRY Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way?
NEWMAN Help! Help!
JERRY Where's Kramer?
NEWMAN HELP!
HELP! ELAINE
ELAINE What's going on?
NEWMAN They're gonna beat me up!
GEORGE No we're not.
JERRY We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.
NEWMAN You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about the keys. Thought he got a bad rap.
JERRY Bad rap?
NEWMAN Yeah. From you.
JERRY Me?
NEWMAN You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La Land. L.A.
JERRY L.A.?
L.A.? JERRY
JERRY I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it?
ELAINE Yeah, yeah, I saw it. I mean, it's complete bullshit.
JERRY Huh?
ELAINE What...?
JERRY No, what'd you say?
ELAINE Nothing. I didn't say anything.
JERRY Oh, you didn't see it.
ELAINE Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep.
JERRY I heard you say something, there.
ELAINE I didn't say anything.
JERRY I'm calling Kramer's mother. I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the music down? Could you turn the music down!
GEORGE Ask her about Kramer.
JERRY She's drunk out of her mind.
JERRY Elaine? Are you there? It's me, I'm locked out of my apartment, I need my spare keys. Where are you? I'm at the coffee shop.
KRAMER Hey! You ever been in an accident?
BIKER About five years ago. I was going down this very road. Same time of day, going about the same speed I'm going now...there was a rock in the road. Couldn't have been more than a pebble. Never really saw it! Lost control of the bike, went flyin' about a hundred feet - came down right on my head. Cracked it wide open! Blood and stuff was just splattered all over the road, there...I broke every bone in my face. Hey, you know, when they found me, my eyes were hanging out of their sockets? Yeah, they pronounced me dead at the scene. I was in a coma for...well, they told me about a year...said I'd be a vegetable for life. Yeah, but I showed 'em. Ever since then I always wear a helmet! Lean!
JERRY Georgie Boy! Way to come through with the keys! Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.
GEORGE Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.
JERRY Don't feel right? What are you talking about?
GEORGE Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you in?
JERRY What is the big deal?
GEORGE Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's keys.
JERRY First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.
GEORGE Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.
JERRY Well, I want those keys.
GEORGE Nope, no can do.
JERRY George, give them to me, I want these keys. I don't want to get physical!
GEORGE Do you wanna fight?
JERRY Do you wanna fight?
GEORGE I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face!
KRAMER And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince.
HIPPIE_1 Oh no. He didn't take back the keys, no way.
KRAMER Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world.
HIPPIE_1 Oh man, what a bummer. That ogre dude's pretty cold, huh?
KRAMER Oh, he's cold.
HIPPIE_1 Lemme tell you something, Kramer. If that ogre dude pulled that crap on me - I'd stab him! I'd cut him in half! I'd git him like a fish, man! That's what I'd do!
KRAMER Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. Hey, you can drop me here!
HIPPIE_1 Hey, what's the rush, man?
KRAMER Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.
HIPPIE_1 Hey, Kramer - have you ever killed a man?
KRAMER What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' in Ivory liquid?
HIPPIE_2 Don't leave, Kramer, stay with us. You know so much about the world, we need you, please Kramer! Please, Kramer! Please, Kramer!
JERRY Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.
GEORGE You're right, how did I miss that? Maybe because it's a crock of sht.
JERRY What's that?
GEORGE Nothing.
JERRY I heard something.
GEORGE Didn't say anything.
KRAMER So, how long you been drivin' this thing?
WOMAN Goin' on four years.
KRAMER Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.
WOMAN Nothin'? Listen to you, you're quite the sweet-talker.
KRAMER You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.
WOMAN You want to give it a try?
KRAMER Really?
WOMAN Do you know how to double-clutch?
KRAMER Yeah.
WOMAN Well, come on!
GEORGE They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!
JERRY Well, this is great.
GEORGE Well, what do they look like?
JERRY They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. "What do they look like."
GEORGE Well, they're obviously not here.
JERRY Well, they've gotta be here somewhere.
GEORGE Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!
JERRY What is this? "Murphy Brown"?
GEORGE What?
JERRY By Elaine Benes?
GEORGE What?
JERRY Elaine's writing a "Murphy Brown"?
GEORGE Lemme see this.
JERRY Wait a second!
GEORGE Gimme half!
JERRY All right, here!
GEORGE Why didn't she tell us?
JERRY Elaine is writing a sitcom...!
ELAINE You weasels!
JERRY What? What?
ELAINE How dare you!
GEORGE We hardly read anything!
JERRY It was funny!
ELAINE Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through all my things? You thought it was funny?
JERRY Well... From what I saw...
ELAINE Well, it's just a first draft!
JERRY I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys.
ELAINE Why did you let him in?!
GEORGE He forced me to!
JERRY I did not!
GEORGE Yes you did!
ELAINE You! Get out! Get out! Get out!
JERRY Elaine, wait! I need my spare keys!
ELAINE Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore!
JERRY Good!
ELAINE And I want my keys back from you!
GEORGE What, you don't want me to hold your keys?
ELAINE No, you can't be trusted!
GEORGE Alright, alright, fine.
JERRY And I don't want you to hold mine!
ELAINE Good! I won't!
JERRY Good! Don't! Are these my keys?
ELAINE These aren't my keys!
GEORGE Whose are these?
ELAINE I don't know!
ELAINE I just thought I could write it.
JERRY Is that something you want to do?
ELAINE I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.
JERRY Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a "Murphy Brown." You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other.
ELAINE O.K., can I just watch the show? God, what an asshole.
JERRY What did you say?
ELAINE I didn't say anything.
JERRY I heard something. Elaine, Elaine! It's Kramer! Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!
ELAINE Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!
JERRY Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!
CANDICE_BERGEN Hi, I'm Murphy Brown, you must be my new secretary.
KRAMER Oh, good morning, Miss Brown.
CANDICE_BERGEN And you are...?
KRAMER Oh, I'm uh, Steven Snell.
CANDICE_BERGEN Snell. Well, hello, Mr. Snell.
KRAMER Steven.
CANDICE_BERGEN Steven. Are you familiar with this computer system?
KRAMER Oh - I'm familiar with it.
CANDICE_BERGEN Steven Snell? I know people...and I have a very good feeling about you.
GEORGE One left...what a joke.
KRAMER You can have this one.
GEORGE No, that's not enough BTUs for my living room...That was a complete waste of time.
ELAINE Hey, I didn't get one either.
JERRY Why do I always have the feeling that everybody's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons?
ELAINE This is what people do.
JERRY No they don't. They're out on some big picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner.
GEORGE You should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. He'd go from state to state. He was away for weeks at a time. It was like he was running for President and he was going through the primaries. We'd get phone calls from motels in New Hampshire.
ELAINE So we took a little ride. What's the big deal?
GEORGE Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish.
JERRY Big accomplishment.
GEORGE Fish. What do they do?
ELAINE What do you do?
KRAMER It's this way.
GEORGE What time is it?
JERRY Five o'clock.
GEORGE Always late. Always late.
JERRY You're not late.
GEORGE I told them to meet me in front of my building at six-fifteen.
ELAINE Who?
GEORGE My parents. It's their anniversary. I'm taking them out to dinner and a show tonight. You think we'll hit traffic?
JERRY Of course we'll hit traffic. It's rush hour.
ELAINE Isn't it going the other way?
JERRY There is no other way in New York. Everybody goes every way all the time.
ELAINE But it's Saturday.
JERRY You got the picnic and burger traffic.
GEORGE I always get myself in this position. Can't be on time. Gotta rush.
ELAINE What's the matter?
JERRY I have to go to the bathroom. Why do they hide the bathroom in these malls?
JERRY You want me to help you with that?
KRAMER No, no, I got it.
JERRY What do you think, Georgie boy?
GEORGE Did I need that pointed out for me? What is that going to do for me? How does that help me, to see her? I'm trying to live my life. Don't show me that.
KRAMER If you like her, go talk to her.
GEORGE Yeah, right. I'll just go up and say, "Hi, how ya' doing? Would you like a glass of white wine?"
JERRY Before you got within twenty feet of this woman, she'd have her finger on the mace button. She's like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off.
KRAMER She's fat.
ELAINE Oh she's fat?
ELAINE What?
JERRY Where's the car?
KRAMER I thought it was here.
GEORGE You don't know where we parked?
GEORGE Oh, this is great.
KRAMER Blue-one. I thought it was blue-one.
JERRY I thought it was green. I remember seeing green.
ELAINE I didn't pay attention.
GEORGE This is just what I need.
ELAINE I'm sure it's right around here.
KRAMER It looks familiar. I remember the elevator.
GEORGE There's elevators all over! It all looks the same.
JERRY It's over there. I know where it is.
ELAINE It's black, right?
KRAMER Dark blue.
GEORGE You come to a parking lot, you write it down. How hard is that?
JERRY There it is!...No, no that's a Toyota.
JERRY Hmmm...I thought it was...
KRAMER Didn't we come in over there?
JERRY I thought it was over there.
ELAINE How long can fish live in one of these plastic bags?
KRAMER About two hours.
ELAINE You'd better find this car.
GEORGE It's this way...
JERRY I really have to go to the bathroom.
KRAMER Why don't you go behind one of these cars? J
KRAMER Why? Nobody's around.
JERRY I'll wait.
KRAMER You know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder. That's what happens to truck drivers. They hold it in all the time. Eventually it starts coming out involuntarily.
JERRY Alright.
KRAMER Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry?
JERRY Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you...wherever I am. There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character.
ELAINE There it is!...No that's not it.
ELAINE Hey, watch it. ...Did you see that car? Maniac. Can you explain something to me? I got six questions wrong on my drivers test. That's the maximum. I read the book, I'm a college graduate. This is a country where fifty percent of its high school students can't locate Europe on a map. How are they all passing that test? It's a mystery.
GEORGE ...Six wrong?
ELAINE Those school zones are a killer.
JERRY Will you let me help you with that?
KRAMER I'm gonna put it down behind that car.
JERRY You're not worried somebody's gonna pee on it?
KRAMER Pink eleven. Remember that.
GEORGE Oh I got it. That I'm supposed to remember. Where the car is, that's insignificant.
ELAINE I think they're laboring.
KRAMER Look at this place. It's huge...
GEORGE I can tell you this. If I am not in front of my house at six-fifteen, when my parents get there, they will put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades.
JERRY Parents never forget a foul-up. I once left a jacket on the bus when I was fourteen. Last week I'm flying to Chicago to do a show, "Make sure you hang on to your jacket."
GEORGE Where the hell is this car, Kramer?
KRAMER It's got to be here.
ELAINE Why are they using so many colors? And the numbers go up to forty.
JERRY Maybe it's not on this level.
GEORGE What?
JERRY There are four different levels. Maybe we're on the wrong level. How long was the escalator ride up?
ELAINE It felt like a couple of levels.
JERRY You should always carry a pad and pen.
GEORGE I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.
KRAMER I have a pen.
JERRY Where was the bathroom in this mall? There are six-hundred stores, I didn't see one bathroom. What is this, like a joke? They finished building the mall and they go, "Oh my god, we forgot the bathrooms."
MOTHER Don't you dare talk to me like that! You hear me?
ELAINE Look at that woman.
MOTHER I told you! I don't care! You'll have to wait.
GEORGE Hey, is that necessary?
MOTHER Why don't you mind your own business?
GEORGE I think hitting a defenseless child is my business.
KID You're ugly.
GEORGE ...What?
KID You're ugly.
GEORGE You are!
KID You are!
GEORGE I should've hit the little son-of-a-bitch. I can't stand kids. Adults think it's so wonderful how honest kids are. I don't need that kind of honesty. I'll take a deceptive adult over an honest kid any day.
KRAMER I found it!
ELAINE He's got it.
KRAMER Oh...no.
JERRY All right, that's it. From now on no more calling out they found it, unless we're sitting in it. Okay?
ELAINE Jerry, look at my fish.
JERRY His eyes look a little cloudy.
GEORGE Oh are they gonna be furious.
JERRY Who's got the tickets?
GEORGE I do. I thought you knew this mall. You said you'd been here before!
KRAMER It was easy the last time.
ELAINE My fish are dying right in front of me! We have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car.
JERRY No one's going to do that.
ELAINE Excuse me, we can't seem to find our car. I was wondering if it would be possible if you're not in a hurry, to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look.
MAN_1 ...Sorry.
ELAINE Five minutes.
MAN_1 Can't do it.
ELAINE We're not wilding.
ELAINE Excuse me - I can't seem to find my car - do you think you could drive me...
ELAINE Oh that's funny? Is that funny? Well tell me if you think this is funny - These fish are dying! They're gasping for oxygen right now! They'll be floating in an hour. Is that funny too?
JERRY Those are really ugly sneakers. Where did you get those?
KRAMER Right here at the mall.
ELAINE Excuse me...
ELAINE Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly sorry. But the fish will be dead. You do know that. They can't live in plastic. That's not me talking, that's science.
JERRY It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. All I have to do is walk into a department store and it's like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in.
KRAMER You drank a whole bottle of water.
JERRY I know.
KRAMER So why don't you just go?
JERRY No I can't.
KRAMER Don't you get tired of following rules?
JERRY You think I'm too cautious?
KRAMER Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to? It's organic.
JERRY Organic. So's Buddy Hackett.
KRAMER Buddy Hackett?
JERRY He's a comedian.
KRAMER I know.
JERRY All right. All right.
KRAMER You can go over here.
JERRY I can manage.
KRAMER George!
KRAMER It'll take you ten seconds.
JERRY Okay, okay. I'll be right back.
SECURITY_GUARD Okay, let's go. Come with me.
JERRY But...
SECURITY_GUARD Come on.
JERRY ...Kramer
JERRY I've had this condition since I was eleven! I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die.
SECURITY_GUARD Well you're still not allowed.
JERRY Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for?
SECURITY_GUARD That's up to you.
JERRY So you don't care if I die.
SECURITY_GUARD What I care about is the sanitary condition of the parking facility.
JERRY It was life and death.
SECURITY_GUARD Uh huh.
JERRY Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
SECURITY_GUARD I don't know.
JERRY Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why!...Do you think I enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning.
JERRY Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services? Oh, it's Saturday. They're closed today. My luck.
SECURITY_GUARD You can tell the police all about it.
KRAMER Jerry!
ELAINE Jerry!
GEORGE Unbelievable, I'm never gonna get out of here. The guy goes to pee, he never comes back. It's like a science fiction story.
ELAINE Maybe he went to one of the other levels. I'll go look for him.
GEORGE Oh now you're gonna go?
ELAINE I'll be back in five minutes.
GEORGE If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you.
ELAINE No, no, I'll be back.
GEORGE Oh what's the difference? We'll all be dead eventually.
KRAMER Does that bother you?
GEORGE Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother you?
KRAMER Not at all.
GEORGE See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it's people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you're not bothered by it. How could it not bother you?
KRAMER I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment.
GEORGE Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile I'm here with you in a parking garage, what am I supposed to do?
JERRY First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know.
SECURITY_GUARD I know what you did.
JERRY Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating.
JERRY And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is.
SECURITY_GUARD Yeah I'm sure.
JERRY You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. It's a vicious cycle.
ELAINE And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking for the car. Five minutes, that's all. I just want to find him.
MAN_1 I can't do it.
ELAINE But why? Why can't you do it?
MAN_1 I can't.
ELAINE No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to.
MAN_1 That's right.
ELAINE But why? Why don't you want to?
MAN_1 I don't know.
ELAINE But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?
MAN_1 No, I wouldn't.
JERRY All right, all right. I want to apologize. I was frightened, I said crazy things. I obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis, the water bottle...I made it all up, and now...I'm going to tell you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth, well I'm jumping ahead here, their forty-seventh wedding anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together. They are supposed to be in front of my building at six-fifteen. What I haven't told you, or anyone else for that matter, is that my father's been in a Red Chinese prison for the past fourteen years.
KRAMER The guy's got a fat fetish. Spector never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty pounds.
GEORGE Really.
KRAMER What does he do with all that fat? Does he just jump up and down on it? Does he gouge it like Killer Kowalski?
GEORGE Who's Killer Kowalski?
KRAMER He was a wrestler. He would grab hold of someone's stomach and just squeeze it until they gave.
GEORGE I've gotta go to the bathroom.
KRAMER So go.
GEORGE Here?
KRAMER You and Jerry.
GEORGE Don't you believe me? It's their fiftieth anniversary. You know this is gonna kill him. You're aware of that. Kill him. On the biggest night of his life...
SECURITY_GUARD Oh your folks have an anniversary today too? Was he also in a Red Chinese prison?
GEORGE A Red Chinese prison?
KRAMER George! George!
ELAINE Jerry!
JERRY Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red China's great military leaders, General Chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken. You know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens?
GEORGE Sure, I have it all the time. Very spicy.
JERRY Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook.
ELAINE Jerry!
JERRY Elaine?!
ELAINE Jerry! Over here...
ELAINE Where have you been?
JERRY I was arrested for urinating.
GEORGE Me too.
ELAINE You what?
JERRY I have uromysitisis. It's very serious you know.
ELAINE Look at my fish...
ELAINE Is he...
JERRY No, but he's not looking good...
ELAINE Please, we can't find our car. Please drive us around the parking lot to find our car. My fish are dying.
MAN_2 Can't do it.
ELAINE I can see not caring what happens to us, we're human. But what about the fish? The fish?
MAN_3 Sorry.
ELAINE That's right, go. Go home to your dumbbells. Work on your pecs. I'm really impressed.
ELAINE That's right you heard me. You got a problem with that?
GEORGE Elaine, shut-up.
JERRY Hey, where's Kramer?
GEORGE I don't know. Where's Kramer?
ELAINE I thought he was with you.
GEORGE See, I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen...
GEORGE Look at the time, that's it.
ELAINE Have we looked over there? Have we checked that side?
GEORGE We came in over there!
ELAINE We didn't come in over there!
JERRY Where's Kramer?
JERRY Hey George, there she is again. ...
GEORGE So what do you want me to do?
JERRY Ask her to drive us around. There's your opening.
GEORGE That is an opening.
GEORGE Excuse me...I really... What's happened is that my friend forgot where he parked and if you're not in a big hurry, we'd really appreciate it if...
AMY Oh sure, I'll drive you around.
GEORGE You will?
AMY Sure.
GEORGE Thanks a lot. I'm really late. My parents are waiting in front of my building and we're stuck here.
AMY I wouldn't want to get lost in here. It smells like a toilet. People are such animals.
GEORGE Yeah, right.
JERRY Filthy pigs.
GEORGE It's a blue Honda...
AMY This has happened to me too. It's very frustrating.
ELAINE Hi, I'm Elaine.
JERRY Jerry.
AMY Hello.
ELAINE It's very nice of you to do this. I've asked several people and they wouldn't even answer me.
AMY I'm happy to do it. I'm Amy.
GEORGE Hi Amy, I'm George.
GEORGE I didn't mean anything by it. I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard! I didn't know you were...
GEORGE ...with that group.
ELAINE What about my fish?
JERRY Boy, those Scientologists. They can be pretty sensitive.
ELAINE I'll say.
ELAINE What is it?
ELAINE The car!
JERRY The car!
GEORGE The car!
ELAINE We found it. I can't believe it!
GEORGE Kramer, Kramer's not here...I knew it. I knew it! I knew this would happen. Kramer! Kramer!
JERRY Kramer!
JERRY Kramer.
KRAMER Jerry?
JERRY Yeah, over here.
KRAMER Boy I had a helluva time finding that air-conditioner. I looked everywhere. I completely forgot where I hid it. You know where it was?
GEORGE Purple 23.
KRAMER Right! Purple 23. I could've used you.
GEORGE Sometimes it's good to have a pencil to write these things down.
KRAMER What time is it?
GEORGE Seven forty-five.
KRAMER Well at least there's no traffic.
GEORGE Right.
KRAMER What time does that play start?
GEORGE Eight o'clock.
KRAMER That might be a problem. Where's your little bag of...
KRAMER Oh... Boy this garage is going to cost a fortune. You know how long we were here?
JERRY Any second now. Light is on! Melissa, waffles are ready.
MELISSA Oh, fantastic! I'm starving.
JERRY How about that.
MELISSA Mmm-hmm.
GEORGE She ate breakfast naked?
JERRY She didn't even want a napkin.
GEORGE I've had bedroom naked, I've had walk-to-the-bathroom naked... I have never had living-room naked.
JERRY Oh, it's a scene.
GEORGE It's like you're livin' in the Playboy Mansion! Did she, uh, did she frolic?
JERRY I don't really have enough room.
GEORGE Yeah. Hey, Lainie, Puddy.
ELAINE Hey!
PUDDY Hi.
JERRY Hey.
PUDDY I got to make a pit stop.
ELAINE 'Kay.
JERRY Back together?
ELAINE His apartment was being fumigated, so we thought we'd give it another shot.
JERRY Ah...
ELAINE So guess who called me last night? Jason Hanke.
GEORGE 'Stanky Hanke'? What did he want?
ELAINE He called to apologize for standing me up five years ago.
JERRY Why now?
ELAINE A.A. It's one of the Twelve Steps. Step number Nine is you have to apologize to anyone you've ever wronged.
GEORGE Ho ho ho ho! I can't wait for Hanke to come crawling back to me.
JERRY Still with the neck hole?
GEORGE Still upset. Very upset.
ELAINE What neck hole?
GEORGE Remember that New Year's party he threw a few years ago? He had that very drafty apartment, you know, I think on Ninth Avenue.
GEORGE I asked if I could borrow a sweater.
JERRY A cashmere sweater.
GEORGE I said preferably cashmere, for warmth. So in front of the whole party, he says, 'No. I don't want you stretching out the neck hole.'
ELAINE Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
GEORGE Oh, yeah, sure, laugh it up. Everybody else did!
ELAINE Well, it's funny. I mean, you have a big head. Or is it 'cause of your neck?
JERRY No, I think the head does most of the stretching.
GEORGE Regardless. I had to walk around for the rest of the party in some cheap Metlife windbreaker. Now, it is payback time.
ELAINE I really think it's the size of your neck.
GEORGE It's my head!
ELAINE Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
ELAINE Hey.
PEGGY Hey.
ELAINE Isn't this great? With those nerds in accounting moved, you and I are the only ones who use this bathroom.
KRAMER You went to the coffee shop without me? I told ya, I just wanted to hop in the shower.
JERRY That was an hour ago. What were you doing in there?
KRAMER Showering. How long does it take you?
JERRY Ten minutes.
KRAMER Ten minutes? That's kooky talk. Hey Elaine, how long do you spend in the shower?
ELAINE Ten minutes.
KRAMER Let me smell you.
ELAINE All right. Whiff away.
KRAMER Uh... that's not bad at all.
ELAINE Hup! That's it.
KRAMER ok
ELAINE So get this. I'm in the bathroom at work today, and I see Peggy using a seat protector.
JERRY So?
ELAINE So... we're the only women on the floor. I mean, we're like roommates. Would-would you use a seat protector if you had a roommate?
JERRY I think the damage is probably already done.
JERRY All right! I'll get that. Well, maybe she just practices good hygiene.
ELAINE Yeah, you're probably right. She's probably one of those neurotic clean freaks.
JERRY Mmm.
KRAMER Well, here's my shower routine. Maybe I can make some changes. Get wash cloth mittens and maybe some liquid soap, and just... -pop- focus!
JERRY Zephyr? That is not a word.
MELISSA Do you challenge?
JERRY No, I do not challenge.
MELISSA 66 points. Ha ha.
JERRY I'd accuse you of cheating, but I don't know where you'd hide the tiles.
MELISSA You want some more ice tea?
JERRY Sure.
MELISSA Wrong pipe.
GEORGE So she coughed.
JERRY Coughing... naked... It's a turn-off, man.
GEORGE Everything goes with naked.
JERRY When you cough, there are thousands of unseen muscles that suddenly spring into action. It's like watching that fat guy catch a cannonball in his stomach in slow motion.
GEORGE Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man. Do you now how much mental energy I expend just trying to picture women naked?
JERRY But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad naked. Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. Hey, there's Hanke.
GEORGE All right. It's grovel time.
HANKE Hey, George. Jerry. Listen, I just got sober, so I've been going through the Twelve Steps.
GEORGE What are you up to now, uh, Step Nine?
HANKE Yeah. Making amends.
GEORGE Important step. Maybe the most important.
HANKE Anyway, uh, Jerry, you know, this may sound dumb, but, you know, when we first met I thought your name was Gary. And, I think I may even have called you Gary a couple of times, and... I don't know if you noticed, but I always felt bad about it, so, I'm sorry.
JERRY Thank you. I did notice, and I appreciate you rectifying it.
HANKE : Great. Great. Well, I'll see you guys later.
KRAMER Well, I just got out of a 27-minute shower. I made some good cuts, and I didn't lose anything I needed. Yeah, I think what I kept is even stronger now.
JERRY You got some suds over here.
KRAMER Wha...? Oh, man! Geez! Look at that! I'm all lathery. Jerry, you got to show me what I'm doing wrong.
JERRY Oh, come on!
KRAMER No, I mean it, man. I'm lost!
JERRY You promise you'll never come in here again?
KRAMER Oh, Jerry, you know I can't do that.
JERRY Now my sense of it is that you're probably wasting time working piecemeal, first cleaning one area, then another.
KRAMER Well, that's how cats do it.
JERRY But, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you want to use gravity.
KRAMER OK. Let's turn the water on now.
JERRY No, I told you, it's just a dry run.
GEORGE Well, Hanke's moved on to Step Ten. He was spotted taking personal inventory.
JERRY That's Step Ten?
GEORGE All he has to do now is count his blessings, say a prayer, and he's done. Do you believe this?
KRAMER Come on, Jerry. How about a-a baggy swimsuit?
JERRY You're not gettin' any skin, Kramer.
KRAMER Well, this has all been one big tease!
ELAINE These proofs look pretty good. Oh. Can I move this? Yup. I think this will work.
PEGGY I'm... gonna get another bottle of water.
WALTER Here, take mine. There's a little left.
PEGGY Oh, thanks, Walter. Ahh!
HANKE Guys, there's no doubt that the pay is good. But I don't just know if I see myself working with ice cream.
MAN_1 You get pretty buff forearms.
HANKE I don't know if I'm into that.
GEORGE Oh, hello, Hanke, others.
HANKE George.
GEORGE You know, Jason, I, uh, I couldn't help notice, I... I didn't get my apology.
HANKE Apology? For what?
GEORGE A drafty apartment? A... sweaterless friend? A ball-game giveaway Metlife windbreaker?
HANKE George, come on, not that neck hole thing.
GEORGE Yeah, the neck hole thing, and I would appreciate it if you would say you're sorry.
HANKE No way, you would've completely stretched it out.
GEORGE You're an alcoholic! You have to apologize. Step Nine! Step Nine.
HANKE All right, George, all right. I'm sorry. I'm very, very sorry. I'm so sorry that I didn't want your rather bulbous head struggling to find its way through the normal-size neck hole of my finely knit sweater.
KRAMER Now see, that's smart. Constant motion. Wow.
MAN_IN_SHOWER Hey!
KRAMER Oh, yeah, yeah, I-I'm watching you, too. But this guy's really showing me something!
KRAMER You got a steak?
JERRY What happened to you?
KRAMER Ah, people in this city are crazy.
JERRY Here ya go.
KRAMER Thanks, buddy. Oh... yes! Hey, you got any A1, 'cause I'm cooking a steak.
JERRY What?
KRAMER Yeah, a different one.
JERRY Oh!
KRAMER Jerry!
MELISSA OK, Jerry. I fixed that bike.
JERRY Oh. That wasn't really necessary. I don't ride it. It's just for show.
MELISSA I should really clean those bearings. Hold this. Look at all that gunk.
JERRY Please don't crouch.
MELISSA Ouch! Caught my skin.
JERRY Oh, that's bad. Especially that area.
MELISSA You got anything to snack on?
JERRY Uhh...
MELISSA Oh, pickles! Unnhhhh! It's a tough one.
JERRY Look, please stop! Let me help you with that!
MELISSA Unnnnh! Oooh. That's gonna leave a welt. Look at that.
JERRY I can't. I can't look anymore. I-I-I've seen too much.
ELAINE Peggy, we've got to talk. What is it about me that you find so offensive?
PEGGY You seem to be with a lot of men.
ELAINE What!? I happen to have a very steady boyfriend. You know, I mean, we broke up a few times and there has been an occasional guy here or... or there, but, wh-why is this your business?
PEGGY It's not. Good day.
ELAINE right. You think I've got germs? I'll give you some germs. How about some for your keyboard, huh? Huh? Oooh, how about for your stapler. Hmmm? That's good, isn't it? You have a happy and a healthy.
JERRY Well, technically he did apologize.
GEORGE Jerry, I felt like a straight man in some horrible sketch. He was riffing! Riffing! On my pain!
JERRY So now you want an apology for the apology, plus the original apology?
GEORGE That's right. I'm two in the hole!
JERRY Well, I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva. She did a full body flex on a pickle jar.
GEORGE Did you explain to her about the good naked and the bad naked?
JERRY Where am I gonna get a fat guy and a cannonball?
GEORGE Well... what if you showed up bad naked, huh? You still got that belt sander?
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE Well, you on all fours, that thing vibratin', kickin' up sawdust, ho ho! She'll get the picture!
JERRY Hello?
KRAMER Hey, Jerry, guess where I'm calling from!
JERRY World War I plane?
KRAMER No, I'm in my shower. Well, you know, I'm trying to get out of the shower sooner, and then I ask myself, 'Why?' I mean this is where I want to be. So I got a waterproof phone, I shaved, I brushed my teeth, and now I ordered a pair of chinos from J. Crew.
JERRY When are ya gettin' out?
KRAMER I'm not! I'll see ya later, buddy.
PETERMAN Bad news, people. Peggy is home sick.
ELAINE Oh, please.
PETERMAN She's stuffed up, achy, and suffering from intense malaise.
ELAINE Oh, come on, we all have intense malaise. Right?
PETERMAN I just spoke with her, Elaine. She's in bed.
ELAINE Yeah, let me tell you something: this is all in her mind, OK? She is insane. She thinks I made her sick because I coughed on her doorknob, rubbed her stapler in my armpit, and put her keyboard on my butt. Yeah, she's a wacko.
GEORGE So you're Jason Hanke's supervisor?
SPONSOR Sponsor.
GEORGE Whatever. Listen, I'm very concerned about this guy.
SPONSOR He's doing very well. He's already on to Step Ten.
GEORGE Yeah, well when you don't actually do the steps, you can go through them pretty quick. You can get through six a day.
SPONSOR Is there some unresolved issue between you and Jason?
GEORGE I don't know. A little thing called Step Nine? Instead of an apology, he was beboppin' and scattin' all over me.
SPONSOR I'm not sure what you want me to do.
GEORGE Well, aren't you the boss of him? You shouldn't let him move up! When I was in the Cub Scouts, I got stuck on Weebolos for three years 'cause I kept losing the Pinewood Derby.
SPONSOR You're quite upset, George.
GEORGE Well, I think you should drop him down to Step Two.
SPONSOR Admit there's a higher power?
GEORGE Yeah, let him chew on that for a while.
SPONER You know George, I think I can help you. We're having a meeting tomorrow. Why don't you just come by?
GEORGE All right. That's more like it. Thank you very much.
GEORGE By the way, my uncle was an alcoholic, so...
KRAMER Lomez, you're not listenin'. Jerry likes the naked, just some of the things she does when she's naked. Calm down, I'm on your side. Geez. Hey, hold on a second. I got a clog, I'll call ya back.
MELISSA What are you doing?
JERRY I found a rough spot on the kitchen floor, I thought I'd polish it up with this belt sander I have here.
MELISSA No, not that. Why are you naked?
JERRY I thought naked is good.
MELISSA This isn't good naked.
SPONSOR George, here, have a seat.
GEORGE Where's Hanke?
SPONSOR Shhhhh.
LEADER OK, let's get started. Welcome to Rage-aholics Anonymous.
GEORGE What? Rate-aholics?
SPONSOR George, this can help you.
GEORGE Hey, I am not here for rage. I'm here for revenge.
LEADER Excuse me. We have a 'no yelling' policy at these meetings.
GEORGE Excuse me. Am I talking to you, Pinhead? Am I?!
LEADER Please don't call me 'Pinhead'.
GEORGE I'm losin' it!
JERRY He took you to Rage-aholics? Why?
GEORGE Probably because this whole Universe is against me!
JERRY You've got a little rage.
GEORGE I know. And now they want me to bottle it up. It makes me so mad!
JERRY By the way, my bad naked demo didn't quite work.
GEORGE This bread has nuts in it!
JERRY Oh, great. Elaine. What is wrong with my body?
ELAINE Chicken wing shoulder blades.
JERRY That's it?
ELAINE No, but that's one problem. Why?
JERRY Well, I was walking around naked in front of Melissa the other day--
ELAINE Whoa! Walking around naked? Ahh... that is not a good look for a man.
GEORGE Why not? It's a good look for a woman.
ELAINE Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male body is utilitarian, it's for gettin' around, like a jeep.
JERRY So you don't think it's attractive?
ELAINE It's hideous. The hair, the... the lumpiness. It's simian.
GEORGE Well, some women like it.
ELAINE Hmm. Sickies.
KRAMER Installing your Clarkman garbage disposal. Dismantle latch hasp beneath main drainage lot. Oh, come on, Clarkman.
PUDDY Puddy.
KRAMER Is, uh, David Puddy there?
PUDDY This is Puddy.
KRAMER Well, this is Kramer.
PUDDY I know.
KRAMER Um, listen, you're a mechanic. Could you help me install a garbage disposal?
PUDDY Well, it's a big job. You've got to dismantle the latch hasp from the auxiliary drainage line.
KRAMER No. It says 'main line'.
PUDDY It's a misprint. What do you got, a Clarkman?
KRAMER Yeah. through it.
KRAMER Oh, OK. Well, thanks, buddy.
ELAINE Hey, Puddy.
PUDDY Hey, Babe, your boss called. You owe five bucks for a balloon bouquet. Yeah, he says you can just give it to him tomorrow when you see him.
ELAINE Balloon bouquet? For who?
PUDDY Peggy took a turn for the worst.
ELAINE Peggy. Oh, great. I suppose she's still blaming me?
PUDDY That's what he said.
ELAINE I don't believe this woman.
PUDDY Talk to me, Babe.
ELAINE She's this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs make her sick.
PUDDY Oh, germ-o-phobe. I know what that's about.
ELAINE Huh?
ELAINE What is this symbol?
PUDDY It's a germ.
PEGGY Elaine, it was very nice of you to bring the man you're currently sleeping with over to talk to me, but I assure you, I don't have any problem with germs.
PUDDY Don't you? Elaine.
PUDDY I know it looks bleak. I've been there. Ten years ago waking up in bed next to a woman like this would've sent me running for the Phisohex.
PEGGY Really?
PUDDY I still have trouble looking at those disgusting old bedroom slippers she slogs around in.
ELAINE Hey, I've had those since college. They're bunnies.
PUDDY They're bacteria traps.
PEGGY So you... just learned to live with it?
PUDDY For the most part.
ELAINE OK, we're broken up for the rest of the day.
JERRY So I'm glad we had a talk and worked this out. Don't you feel this is better?
MELISSA This is nice.
JERRY Yes, clothes. This is normal.
MELISSA Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? I was thinking that we could go down...
MELISSA Jerry? Jerry, are you listening to me?
JERRY Oh... yeah. What? I'm sorry.
MELISSA I wanted to know what you're doing tomorrow.
JERRY Oh, maybe a haircut, and, I don't know, maybe a...
KRAMER So you broke up?
JERRY We couldn't carry on a conversation. I kept trying to picture her naked, she kept trying to not picture me naked.
KRAMER Hang on.
JERRY So what are you up to?
KRAMER Oh, just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy. Hey, how do you make those radish roses?
JERRY Insert a knife into the center and twist. Then, to make it bloom, soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes.
KRAMER No problem there.
HANKE George. Thanks for coming down to talk to me. I wanted to see you right away, but my hours here aren't very flexible. I just started yesterday.
GEORGE Well, I'm here. What is it?
HANKE Well, I talked to my sponsor, and, uh, I've thought it over, and, you know, my apology at the coffee shop was sarcastic, and rude, and you deserve much better.
HANKE You're welcome.
KID Can I get a Triple Minute Man Mint?
HANKE Waffle or sugar cone?
GEORGE Uh, excuse me, uh, um, Jason. I don't want to get into a big thing here, but... I'm not sure if, technically, what you just said was actually an apology.
HANKE What?
KID Can you get on that cone?
HANKE Would you hang on just a second, son? George, what are you talking about?
GEORGE Well, it's just, all you said was 'your welcome', which is nice. It's very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology.
KID Is there anybody else here but you?
HANKE I'm alone, and it's my second day. You know, I don't even think we have that flavor so... George, really, enough, ok? You know, I-I admitted I was wrong, so what more do you want from me?
GEORGE I would like an apology.
HANKE All right, look, you know--
KID_2 Did you try it?
KID No, this guy doesn't know what he's doing.
HANKE Oh, yes I do. Yes, I do. OK? I'm interacting with someone here, if you can understand that. Now, I'm sorry.
GEORGE Baah! There it is! You just said it! That's what I want! Now say it again, and tell it to me.
HANKE I'm not saying anything to you. I'm not sorry. I was never sorry. It was cashmere. I hate Step Nine! Where's that Rum Raisin? Where is it? Can't find anything. I need a drink. Ah, daquiri ice. Here we go. What are you looking at? Get out! Come on, can't you see we're closed?! Get out!
ELAINE Mmm. This food is fantastic
PEGGY And what a pretty radish rose, huh?
KRAMER Well, thank you.
ELAINE Here's to Peggy, on her first week of being germ-free, free.
KRAMER Yeah. And here's to David Puddy for helping me install a much needed and much appreciated garbage disposal in my bathtub.
PEGGY You have a garbage disposal in your bathtub?
KRAMER Oh, yeah, and I use it all the time. Yeah, I made this whole meal in there.
ELAINE This food was in the shower with you?
KRAMER Mm-hmm. I prepared it as I bathed.
PUDDY Oh, germs. Germs. Germs!
GEORGE Excuse me. Is this, uh, Rage-aholics?
GEORGE Thanks. What are you guys doin' here?
ELAINE Kramer.
GEORGE Right.
HANKE Hi, I'm, uh, Jason. I'm a rage-aholic.
AUDIENCE Hi, Jason.
HANKE Uh, this is my first meeting.
GEORGE Step-skipper. That man is a step-skipper! He skips Step Nine!
HANKE Please. Step Nine.
GEORGE That's right! He never apologized to me for saying that I would stretch out the neck hole of his sweater.
GEORGE It wasn't funny.
HANKE It was a very nice sweater. Take a look at his neck, not to mention the melon sitting on top of it. I don't know if I'd trust him with a v-neck.
GEORGE He's beboppin' and scattin', and I'm losin' it!
JERRY Cup of tea with lemon.
GEORGE What happened to your voice?
JERRY I was screamin' at hecklers all night. The last time I open for a rodeo.
GEORGE Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'. I've gotten as far as I can go with George Costanza.
JERRY Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?
GEORGE The nickname. George. What is that? It's nothing. It's got no snap, no zip. I need a nickname that makes people light up.
JERRY You mean like...Liza!
GEORGE But I was thinking...T-bone.
JERRY But there's no "t" in your name. What about G-bone?
GEORGE There's no G-bone.
JERRY There's a g-spot.
GEORGE That's a myth.
JERRY T-bone, the ladies are gonna love ya.
ELAINE Why did they hire you for a rodeo?
JERRY They heard I opened for Kenny Rogers once.
ELAINE Didn't he throw you off a bus in the middle of Alabama or--
JERRY Oh, I had that comin' to me.
ELAINE You know, Kenny Rogers has a-
ELAINE Why did you get a maid?
JERRY You don't have to whisper. She knows she's a maid.
ELAINE Where did you get her?
JERRY I hired her from a service!
MAID All done.
JERRY Thank you. Nice job.
MAID Is this mine?
JERRY Yeah.
JERRY What?
ELAINE Come on, Jerry. You didn't notice?
JERRY Notice what? She's not really even a maid.
ELAINE Oh.
JERRY She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or a...news woman.
ELAINE Uh-huh. News woman. Yeah.
KRAMER Hey. Well, bad news, boys. My life is over. My girlfriend's movin' away.
JERRY You have a girlfriend?
KRAMER Jerry, where have you been?
JERRY At a rodeo. Where's she moving?
KRAMER Downtown.
ELAINE Downtown New York?
KRAMER Yeah. I don't know if I can handle one of these long-distance relationships.
JERRY It's like 10 minutes by subway.
KRAMER I don't know.
KRAMER Oh! Jeez! Well, you've got a maid. It's a whole different world downtown-- different Gap, different Tower Records, and she's a 646.
ELAINE What? What is that?
JERRY That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all the new numbers are 646.
ELAINE I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night.
KRAMER Listen. Heads up, Elaine. I'm gonna have to stop by later and pick up a fax.
ELAINE At work?
KRAMER No. At your apartment.
ELAINE I don't have a fax machine.
JERRY Here we go.
KRAMER Well, now what are we gonna do? See? This is why you should get a fax and a Xerox.
JERRY And a dead bolt.
KRAMER to Elaine Are ya sure you don't have one? Because there's a lot of stuff in my apartment I've never seen.
ELAINE Then maybe you have a fax machine.
KRAMER You just blew my mind.
KRUGER Let's order lunch.
KRUGER Mary, I will have a chef's salad.
MALE_WORKER Turkey sandwich.
GEORGE T-bone steak.
KRUGER For lunch?
GEORGE Well, I am just a T-bone kinda guy. Love that T-bone. In fact, you might as well call me--
WATKINS That sounds good. I'll have one, too.
KRUGER Watkins, you're havin' a T-bone?
WATKINS I love 'em.
KRUGER Well, then we should call you T-bone.
GEORGE Uh, no. No, we shouldn't.
KRUGER T-bone!
ALL T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone!
ELAINE Hello? A fax squeal.
ELAINE What?
MACHINE You have 57 messages. Message one... Message two... Message three...
GEORGE Hey, it's George. Listen, I-
MACHINE Message four...
ELAINE Kramer!
ELAINE Hello?
ELAINE Aah!
JERRY Well Cindy, the place looks great.
CINDY Thanks Jerry, gotta run.
JERRY Ok, I'll see ya.
CINDY Hi, Elaine.
ELAINE All right! You're foolin' around with your maid. That is a wise decision.
JERRY Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation so obviously fraught with potential complications?
ELAINE You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep with you.
JERRY No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--
ELAINE What? A health plan?
JERRY I was going to say, "Being a good host."
ELAINE Oh-ho-ho. Oh.
JERRY But the point is we have our personal relationship, and we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some what sophisticated.
ELAINE So you consider this a relationship?
JERRY Yes, I do.
ELAINE Oh. Have you been out?
JERRY Yes, we have.
ELAINE Where did you go?
JERRY The store.
ELAINE Mm! To get what?
JERRY Stuff.
ELAINE Cleaning supplies?
JERRY And gum.
ELAINE Oh. Well, there's nothin' more sophisticated than diddlin' the maid and then chewin' some gum.
JERRY She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!
KRAMER Hey. Well, I just saw Madeline off. Yeah. She's in a cab and--nguh nguh nguh--on her way. I miss her already.
ELAINE Hey, Kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house every 30 seconds?
KRAMER Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the menus from some restaurants.
ELAINE Which ones?
KRAMER Well, all of them. It's the deluxe package.
ELAINE So this is never gonna stop?
KRAMER Well, it better not. Paid for the whole year. So, should I pick those up later?
ELAINE You can pick 'em up right now.
KRAMER Ah!
ELAINE I wonder if anyone knows he's here. If he just disappeared...would anybody notice?
PHONE_MAN All right, miss Benes, all finished. Here's your new number.
ELAINE Ahem. 646? What is this?
PHONE_MAN That's your new area code.
ELAINE I thought 646 was just for new numbers.
PHONE_MAN This is a new number.
ELAINE No, no, no, no. It's not a new number. It's--it's--it's just a changed number. See? It's not different. It's the same, just...changed.
PHONE_MAN Look, I work for the phone company. I've had a lot of experience with semantics, so don't try to lure me into some maze of circular logic.
ELAINE You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known.
PHONE_MAN I could've killed you, and no one would've known.
JERRY Kramer, you're still on the phone?
KRAMER Madeline and I are watching Quincy together. Jerry, you know this comes on at the same time here as it does there?
JERRY Really? It's Tuesday here. What day is it there?
KRAMER Jerry's teasing. Uh-oh! Commercial. Oh, you going to the bathroom? Yeah. I'll go, too.
JERRY Madeline stays here.
JERRY Hey, T-bone!
GEORGE No. No T-bone.
JERRY No T-bone?
KRAMER Hey, is that T-bone?!
JERRY No! There's no T-bone!
KRAMER Well, why no T-bone?!
JERRY Why no T-bone?
GEORGE 'Cause Neil Watkins from accounting is T-bone!
KRAMER Oh, yeah I'm back. Hey, you wanna play cards over the phone?
KRAMER Oh, hey, uh, listen, Jerry, uh, laundry's pilin' up there. You might want to tell your girlfriend. Mmm. Yeah.
GEORGE Your girlfriend is doin' your laundry?
KRAMER He's sleeping with his maid!
GEORGE You're sleepin' with the maid?
JERRY Yes.
GEORGE I've done that. Did you ever eat an ostrich burger?
JERRY No.
MAN You're probably one of those women who doesn't like to give out her number.
ELAINE No, I'm not. Here you go.
MAN 646?
ELAINE It's a new area code.
MAN What area? New Jersey?
ELAINE No, no. It's right here in the city. It's the same as 212. They just multiplied it by 3, and then they added one to the middle number. It's the same.
MAN Do I have to dial a one first?
MAN I'm really kinda seein' somebody.
ELAINE Yeah? Well, so am I!
GEORGE Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second there, Watkins?
WATKINS It's T-bone.
GEORGE The thing is...I'm supposed to be T-bone.
WATKINS Heh heh. You're not a T-bone. You're a perfect George.
GEORGE What? Now, you listen to me!
KRUGER Hey, look at George. He's givin' it to T-bone. He's jumpin' up and down like some kind of monkey. Hey, what was the name of that monkey that could read sign language?
WATKINS All right, you can have T-bone. Stop crying.
GEORGE I'm not crying. And I shouldn't have said that about your wife. Please accept my apologies.
GEORGE Ok, everybody, uh...I have an announcement to make. From now on, I will be known as-
KRUGER Koko the monkey.
GEORGE What?
ALL Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko!
MAN Thank you both for being here.
ELAINE Um, excuse me. I live in the building. Did something happen to Mrs. Krantz?
MAN She passed.
ELAINE Oh, I'm so sorry.
MAN Thank you.
ELAINE A quick question-- did she by any chance have a 212 phone number?
CINDY I can't find my earring. Oh, here it is.
KRAMER Hey, listen, can I borrow your suitcases?
JERRY Yeah. It's in your closet.
KRAMER No, no, no. I looked.
JERRY They're behind my skis and my tennis racket.
KRAMER Thanks, buddy.
JERRY Where you goin'?
KRAMER Huh? Well, I'm gettin' out of town. I'm gonna visit Madeline for the weekend. You know, this place is lookin' kinda messy. What happened to Cindy?
JERRY Well, she's here. She just didn't get around to it.
KRAMER Oh.
CINDY Hi, Kramer.
CINDY Thanks, Jerry. Bye.
KRAMER Well, what's the matter?
JERRY What did I just pay for?
KRAMER Uh-oh. You're a john.
JERRY Koko?
GEORGE Koko.
JERRY Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is.
GEORGE Yeah. So, how's Cindy the maid?
JERRY Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' for sex.
GEORGE Tell me about it. I went out with this girl last week. First I had to pay for dinner, then--
JERRY No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like I'm seein' a prostitute.
GEORGE How much you pay this maid?
JERRY 40.
GEORGE 40? I'm payin' 60 to my maid. She doesn't do laundry and I'm gettin' nothin'. All right. Once she pinched my ass, but I don't know what that was.
JERRY I don't know what this is.
KRAMER Hey, hey, hey. Look at that.
JERRY Ooh.
KRAMER Jerry, you wouldn't believe what it's like down there. Taxicab drivers are insane. You know, everybody is in a hurry.
GEORGE I can't eat with you leanin' over like this. Just look straight forward.
KRAMER Well, now I can't see Jerry.
JERRY I look about the same.
GEORGE What?
JERRY I was talking to him.
KRAMER What?
JERRY Never mind.
KRAMER Come on. What'd he say?
GEORGE Never mind.
KRAMER Jerry, come on. What'd you say?
JERRY What?
KRAMER Come on. Where'd you go?
JERRY Go back.
KRAMER Eh! Come on. What did you say?
JERRY I said, never mind.
KRAMER Yeah. I know that. Uh, uh.
JERRY I hate the counter.
ELAINE Hey.
JERRY Hey.
ELAINE I hate the counter.
KRAMER Who's that?
ELAINE Well, I got a 212 number from this little old lady in my building-- Mrs. Krantz.
JERRY Oh, she didn't mind?
ELAINE No. She died.
JERRY Hey, that's great.
GEORGE What happened to Mrs. Krantz?
JERRY Elaine got a new number because she died.
KRAMER Newman died?
ELAINE What did he say?
JERRY Some new kind of pie.
GEORGE I'll try a piece.
KRAMER All right, who's down there?
JERRY Hey, there's a booth.
KRAMER Hey, Elaine.
ELAINE Oh, hi.
KRAMER Did you hear about Newman?
ELAINE What?
GEORGE Hey.
JERRY So how's it goin' at work? They get tired of it?
GEORGE Oh, yeah.
JERRY Double zero?
GEORGE It's "ooh" As in "ooh ooh ah ah."
CINDY Your nickname's Koko? One of the girls down at the maid service is named Coco.
GEORGE Really? Coco?
CINDY Yeah. Coco. That girl's all right.
GEORGE You know, if I could get this Coco woman down to Kruger, they wouldn't be able to call me Koko anymore because Kruger would never allow 2 Kokos.
JERRY Sounds like he runs a real tight ship.
GEORGE Say good-bye to Koko.
JERRY Good-bye, Koko.
KRAMER Bye, Koko. Whew! Jerry, this relationship is killing me. The distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, I didn't realize it, but I'm a needy person.
JERRY Kramer, maybe this relationship isn't for you.
KRAMER Oh, yeah? So what am I supposed to do, be more like you? All sealed up in here, emotionally unavailable, paying scrubwomen for sexual favors! No! Jerry, I won't be like you! Never! I'll never be like you!
CINDY What was that?
JERRY I didn't hear anything.
CINDY All right, I'm takin' off. Aren't you forgetting something?
JERRY Oh, right! Hey, it was great seeing you again. I love your outfit.
CINDY No. My money.
JERRY For what?
CINDY For my maid services. You booked me for today.
JERRY But you didn't really do any work.
CINDY I made the bed.
JERRY But you took a nap in it.
CINDY So?
JERRY I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.
CINDY No. That was the maid.
JERRY Well, who took the nap?
CINDY The girlfriend.
JERRY $40 seems kind of steep for a nap.
CINDY So, what are you saying? That I'm a bad maid or some kind of a prostitute?
JERRY Ho, ho...ho! Hold on. Let's keep this sophisticated.
CINDY You know, I don't think I want to be your girlfriend or your maid.
JERRY So is this a breakup/quitting?
CINDY Yeah. Don't ever call me or hire me again.
JERRY Oh, yeah? Well, then, we're through! And you're fired!
PHONE_MAN Sign here.
ELAINE Yes! 212.
ELAINE Hey, what happened to the guy I had last time?
PHONE_MAN Oh, you know, it's an odd thing. He went out on a job and never came back. Nobody knows what happened.
ELAINE All right! I am back in the game.
ELAINE Hello?
BOY Gammy!
ELAINE No. You got the wrong number, kid.
BOY Gammy Krantz, it's your grandson Bobby. Why haven't you called?
ELAINE Oh...nuts.
BOY Do you hate me 'cause of my lazy eye?
ELAINE No. It's just that I've been kind of buried over here.
JERRY So the kid doesn't know his grandmother is dead? G-5?
ELAINE Hit. No. I guess his parents didn't want to tell him. B-2?
JERRY Miss.
ELAINE He called 6 times yesterday. What a nightmare it must be to have a real family.
JERRY I wouldn't worry about it. B-6?
ELAINE Hit. Uhh...you sank my submarine.
JERRY Elaine...
JERRY Hello?
COMPUTER_VOICE You have a collect call from--
KRAMER Hey, buddy, don't say no!
JERRY I accept.
KRAMER I went down to Madeline's. I told her, "You gotta move, or it's over."
JERRY Well, what happened?
KRAMER I think it's over. We had a big fight, she threw me out, I started walkin', and now I'm lost downtown! I don't have any money. I don't recognize anybody. I miss home, and I don't even know how to get there.
JERRY What's around you?
KRAMER I'm lookin' at Ray's Pizza. You know where that is?
JERRY Is it Famous Ray's?
KRAMER No. It's Original Ray's.
JERRY Famous Original Ray's?
KRAMER It's just Original, Jerry!
JERRY Well, what street are you on?
KRAMER Hey, I'm on first and first. How can the same street intersect with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe.
JERRY Just wait there. I'll pick you up, and, Kramer, stay alive no matter what occurs, I will find you!
KRAMER Aah!
MAN You Steinfeld?
JERRY Yeah.
MAN My name is Maxwell. I'm from Maid To Order. It's a pun. I sent one of my girls over to your place.
JERRY Cindy.
MAN She says she had a little problem with you. You didn't pay.
JERRY You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to do.
MAN Oh, yeah? She told me what you like. You're a little sickie, aren't you? Disinfectant on the blinds, vacuuming the counter--
JERRY Hey, come on. Come on. I gotta live around here.
MAN You know what I do to people who stiff me on a job?
JERRY What?
MAN Well, it kinda depends on the situation, but if I don't get my money from you, I'm gonna get it from her.
JERRY I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? Here.
MAN Hey! Wait, wait, wait! Whoa! Give it to the girl. I'm an independent contractor. Tax purposes.
ELAINE Bobby, you gotta stop calling your Gammy. Why? Because sometimes you call very early in the morning when Gammy has been out late the night before and sometimes when Gammy's not alone. Your parents still haven't said anything to you about your Gammy? All right, here we go. Gammy doesn't feel so good. I think Gammy might be dying. Yep. Yep. Ok. Good-bye, Bobby. Don't call anymore. I'm dead now. Gotta go.
BOBBY 9-1-1.
JERRY Nexus of the universe. Hey, Cindy. Cindy.
CINDY What do you want?
JERRY Here. I got your money.
CINDY I don't want any money from you.
JERRY Come on. Take it. It's money. Let me give it to ya.
POLICE Looking for a good time, sir? You wanna step out of the car, sickie?
JERRY Well, this is all very sophisticated.
FIREMAN All right, hang on, Gammy! You're gonna make it!
ELAINE Aah!
MAXWELL Hey, you look a little lost. You from around here?
KRAMER Uh, no.
MAXWELL You know where you're going?
KRAMER Not really. My friend was supposed to pick me up, but I don't know where he is.
MAXWELL Doesn't sound like much of a friend. You got any money?
KRAMER Uh, no.
MAXWELL You wanna make some?
KRAMER Ok.
MAXWELL Do you know how to use a mop wringer?
KRAMER Yeah, yeah.
MAXWELL Why don't you get in the car?
KRAMER Hi. Ahh...these are soft seats.
KRUGER Hey, Koko, Who's this?
GEORGE This is our new Vice-president of Acquisitions, sir.
KRUGER So you're just hiring new people now? That's your job, to hire people?
GEORGE Yes?
KRUGER Ok, good enough for me, Koko.
KRUGER Ahem. Now, what's your name?
COCO My name is Coco. Coco Higgins.
GEORGE Coco?
KRUGER We can't have 2 Cocos. So I guess you're back to being George.
GEORGE Well, it was a hell of a ride.
KRUGER All right, the Grace building. There's a big stain on the front. How do we get it off?
COCO When I was a little girl in Jamaica, my Gammy taught me to take a wet rag and in a circ--
GEORGE Ah, excuse me, Vice-president Coco, no one cares about your Gammy.
COCO What did you say about my Gammy?
GEORGE Forget Gammy.
KRUGER Who's Gammy?
GEORGE There's no Gammy.
KRUGER Maybe there should be a Gammy.
GEORGE Oh, no.
KRUGER George.
ALL Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy!
GEORGE Gammy's gettin' upset!
GEORGE She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don't like nice.
JERRY This is amazing, I haven't seen one guy going in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy.
GEORGE Why is nice bad? What kind of sick society we are living in, when nice is bad?
JERRY What's that smell? What are you wearing?
GEORGE Little cologne.
JERRY Manly.
GEORGE Monica wants me to wear it.
JERRY So why didn't you say no?
GEORGE I'm too nice.
JERRY Poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan waiting him to send back money. This is horrible.
GEORGE She wants me to take an IQ test.
JERRY That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.
GEORGE No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's part of her research project, I have to be a guinea pig.
JERRY I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody.
GEORGE You know, I can't talk to you anymore.
JERRY All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test.
GEORGE Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart.
JERRY Who thinks you're smart?
GEORGE I'm not going to break a hundred in this thing.
JERRY What thing?
GEORGE You don't listen when people talk to you anymore!
JERRY Oh, the IQ thing...yeah.
GEORGE I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores for 15 years.
JERRY What did you get?
GEORGE What did I get or what do I say I got?
JERRY What do you say?
GEORGE I say fourteen o nine .
JERRY 1409, that's a good score.
GEORGE You're telling me.
JERRY What did you really get?
GEORGE You are my friend.
JERRY Of course.
GEORGE I tell you everything, right?
JERRY I hope so.
GEORGE Well, this I take to the grave.
JERRY He's serving Mexican ,Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one is going in.
ELAINE Why do you keep watching?
JERRY I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for a survival. And even if you know it's not going to make it, you kind of root it for awhile.
ELAINE And then you flush.
JERRY Well, it's a spider.
ELAINE You know, sometimes people won't go in to a place, if they don't see anyone else in there.
ELAINE You have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying.
JERRY Bazooka Joe.
JERRY The buzzer.
ELAINE It's your house.
JERRY My house? You have to be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah?
INTERCOM It's George.
JERRY Come on up.
ELAINE Casus belli.
JERRY What's that?
ELAINE It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud.
JERRY Go in, go in!
ELAINE Have you gone in there?
JERRY No, I'm afraid if we start talking, I'm gonna wind up going partners with him.
GEORGE Hi.
JERRY You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us both a favor.
GEORGE I'm wearing some cologne, all right?
ELAINE Sure, fine.
JERRY Casus belli.
ELAINE Casus belli.
GEORGE What's that?
ELAINE Since when do you wear cologne?
GEORGE Why what I do is so important? Why must I be always the vocal point of attention? Let me just be, let me live.
JERRY Hey, how did you do on that IQ test?
GEORGE I didn't take it yet.
ELAINE What IQ test?
GEORGE What's casus belli.
JERRY Oh, it's nothing...
GEORGE Is it about me?
JERRY Why must you always be the vocal point of attention? Why can't you just be? Why can't you live?
ELAINE It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test?
JERRY This woman he's dating is making him to take this IQ test for this course.
ELAINE Oh, that sounds like fun.
GEORGE Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing.
ELAINE You'll do well, you're smart.
JERRY No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not.
ELAINE What did you get on your SAT's?
GEORGE It varies.
JERRY You know, I don't even know my IQ.
ELAINE Mine's 145.
GEORGE 145!
JERRY Get out of here!
ELAINE You get out of here!
JERRY You get out of here!
GEORGE You should take the test for me.
JERRY Well, that would be something, cheating on a IQ test. Hey, remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became a legend after that.
GEORGE Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why wouldn't we do that again?
ELAINE What?
GEORGE You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out the window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor.
ELAINE Are you serious?
GEORGE Why not?
ELAINE Where would I take the test?
GEORGE I don't know, she lives right around the corner. Take it here or go to the coffee shop.
ELAINE No, that would be too noisy.
JERRY Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.
ELAINE Hey, what do you think?
JERRY Hey, I love a good caper.
ELAINE Yeah, that's what is is, a caper.
GEORGE You'll do it?
ELAINE What the hey.
GEORGE Yeaah, beautiful... Sorry...
BABU Welcome to the Dream Cafe.
JERRY Well, I've been looking forward to it.
BABU Oh, how did you hear about us?
JERRY Eh, people, people are talking.
BABU Smoking or non smoking? We are proud to offer both.
JERRY Non smoking would be great.
BABU Very good. My name is Babu Bhatt, I will be your waiter. A steaming hot face cloth for your pleasure.
JERRY Thank you.
BABU Our specials are tacos, moussaka and franks and beans.
JERRY Well, what do you recommend my good fellow?
BABU Oh, the turkey.
JERRY Oh, the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment here , my friend. I'm sure you flourish in this location for many many years.
BABU You're a very kind man. Very kind, thank you. Very kind...
JERRY Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something like this? Nobody. Nobody thinks about people like I do. All right, snap out of it you stupid jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. What do want, a nobel price?
GEORGE You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here.
MONICA But why?
GEORGE I can't concentrate in front of you.
MONICA Oh, I think you're making too much of this. IQ tests don't mean anything.
GEORGE Are you kidding me? This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons intelligence.
MONICA Well, I certainly don't place any importance on it.
GEORGE Well, I think you're wrong about that. And now if you would excuse me, I would like to get started please.
MONICA Good luck.
GEORGE Don't need it.
ELAINE What's been going on in there? I've been standing here for 20 minutes.
GEORGE I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing this.
ELAINE All right, what time do you want me back here.
GEORGE Eh, twenty to three.
ELAINE Ok.
GEORGE Thanks again.
ELAINE All right.
GEORGE And don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius.
JERRY Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur I must say.
BABU It is in deed my pleasure.
JERRY Oh, please...
BABU Oh, welcome to the Dream Cafe. Our specials today...
ELAINE Oh, no no I'll just have a tea and toast.
BABU Tea and toast.
JERRY Eat something! Babu...
ELAINE Um, ok, I'll have the rigatoni.
BABU Oh, very good choice. Very good.
JERRY Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating.
ELAINE I know.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER Oh boy. Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine...
ELAINE Hey.
KRAMER This guy leaves this jacket at my mothers house two years ago. Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back.
JERRY So?
KRAMER Well, I'm not giving it back.
JERRY Why not?
KRAMER Because I meat a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're attracted to it. Why do you think my mother went out with him?
KRAMER Oh, gees...
ELAINE Yeah, ok...
KRAMER Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of limitations on that?
JERRY Statute.
KRAMER What?
JERRY Statute of limitations. It's not a statue.
KRAMER No, statue.
JERRY Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations.
KRAMER Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it statue or statute of limitations?
ELAINE Statute.
KRAMER Oh, I really think you're wrong.
ELAINE Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a long of time.
KRAMER What test?
ELAINE An IQ test.
KRAMER Why do you take an IQ test?
ELAINE It's for George.
KRAMER George?
ELAINE Yeah, can I...can I explain it to you later?
KRAMER Why are you taking an IQ test for George?
ELAINE Would you please?!
KRAMER What, is it for a job or something?
ELAINE Later!
KRAMER You're positive it's statute?
ELAINE Yes, yes!
BABU Welcome, welcome. A steaming hot face cloth...
MONICA George?
GEORGE Yeah?
MONICA The door is locked.
GEORGE Oh, it's locked?
MONICA I need to get something.
GEORGE Monica, I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer.
MONICA George!
GEORGE Wish I could.
BABU Ladadeeda, laadadeeda....
ELAINE Babu! If you don't mind?
ELAINE Oh my God! It's all over the test!
BABU Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
ELAINE Oh man! Look at this...and I'm late anyway.
BABU Please, forgive me, please...
JERRY Go ahead, I'll take care of it.
BABU I'm very sorry. Tell your friends!
JERRY It's all right, she was cheating anyway.
BABU You're a very kind man.
JERRY Babu, you're Pakistani?
BABU Yes, Pakistani, yes.
JERRY Babu, may I say something?
BABU Of course, you're a very smart man, I'll listen.
JERRY I'm not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to franks and beans for example.
BABU But there are no Pakistani people here.
JERRY Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood.
BABU Yes, you see everything, don't you?
JERRY Well, not everything. I do what I can.
BABU I'll close down today and when I open again it'll be whole Pakistani restaurant. Thank you, thank you very much, you're very special person, very special.
JERRY I am such a great guy. Who else would've gone through the trouble of helping this poor immigrant? I am special. My mother was right. Of course I've never had Pakistani food. How bad it could be?
ELAINE It was an accident.
GEORGE What did you go on a picnic?
ELAINE Babu Bhatt did it.
GEORGE Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this?
MONICA Time's up George.
GEORGE Ok. Here you go.
MONICA How did you do?
GEORGE Piece of cake.
MONICA What happened to the test?
GEORGE What? I spilled some food on it.
MONICA Food? What food?
GEORGE What are you talking about?
MONICA Where did you get food?
GEORGE From my pocket.
MONICA What?
GEORGE I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket.
MONICA And coffee?
GEORGE Yeah, had some coffee, yeah.
MONICA Where did you get the coffee?
GEORGE Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee, from the grocery store.
MONICA How did you get there?
GEORGE I walked.
MONICA How did you get out of the apartment? I didn't see you leave.
GEORGE I climbed out the window.
MONICA You climbed out the window?
GEORGE Of course.
MONICA Why didn't you go out the door?
GEORGE The door? Why would I go out the door? The window is right here.
MONICA You are a fascinating man, George Costanza.
JERRY Most people in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not me.
ELAINE You're very special.
KRAMER Hey, do me a favor. If some guy comes in looking for me, tell him you don't know where I am.
JERRY Of course, I always do.
KRAMER No, no it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket.
ELAINE Just give it back to him.
KRAMER Oh, he'll have to kill me.
JERRY Hey Georgie!
GEORGE Coming up.
JERRY How did you do on the IQ test?!
GEORGE 85!
JERRY What?!!
GEORGE 85, Jerry! 85 IQ !
ELAINE 85?
JERRY Well, well, well...
ELAINE He's coming up?
JERRY Well, I'm no genius, but according to my calculations he should be here in a few seconds.
ELAINE Yeah, but an 85, that's ridiculous.
JERRY Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions about hunting and testicles...
GEORGE Oh, hello professor.
ELAINE George, I cannot believe...
GEORGE Please...
ELAINE No there has got be a mistake.
GEORGE You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist.
JERRY But an 85?
ELAINE There were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate.
JERRY_MOCKING It was a madhouse.
ELAINE Jerry! It was! Let me take it again.
GEORGE Whow, forget it.
ELAINE Oh, come on, come on. I guarantee 140. What do you have to lose?
GEORGE You could do worst!
ELAINE No, no, I guarantee it.
GEORGE All right, I'll ask her.
ELAINE Ok, now where I'm going to take it.
JERRY Take it here, I'll leave, there'll be no distractions.
JERRY Well, congratulations my friend. You know, I sorry I missed the grand re-opening. I was out of town for about a week.
BABU You see how I listened. I worked very hard, borrowed more money.
JERRY I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm.
BABU You wish to eat?
JERRY Let me tell you something Babu. You go back there in that kitchen and tell your chef I want the works.
BABU Very good.
JERRY Very good? No, not very good, very great. I am very, very great.
JERRY You know the IQ test has always that sample question at the beginning where they show how to fill in the circle. It should be the first eliminating point right there. Anybody goes outside of that circle, yeah you wanna come with us, yeah you're done, the test is over, you went outside the circle ok?
ELAINE What are you doing?
KRAMER Quiet. Shh, don't say anything.
ELAINE What's going on?
MAN_BEHIND_THE_DOOR Hey, Kramer! I saw you going there! I'm not leaving until I get the jacket. Open up Kramer!
ELAINE Why did you come in here for?
KRAMER I thought I'd throw him off. See, he knows where I live.
ELAINE Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out of here.
KRAMER I thought you took the test.
ELAINE I had to take it again.
KRAMER How come?
ELAINE What's the difference?!!
KRAMER Well, you can't leave now.
ELAINE What?
MAN_BEHIND_THE_DOOR Come on, Kramer! I want that jacket back!
KRAMER Never!
MONICA George, open up.
MONICA Well?
GEORGE How' you doing?
MONICA Where's the test?
GEORGE You know, it's the damnedest thing. I went out the window again to get a cup of coffee...
JERRY Babu? Babu... Babu...you know, I got to tell you, I never do this, but the shrimp, it's just that it's a little stringy. You have any chicken?
BABU The shrimp is stringy?
JERRY Well, maybe your refrigerator...
BABU Quiet!! You shut up! You make me change restaurant, but nobody comes! You say make Pakistani, Babu Bhatt have only Pakistani restaurant. But where are people? You see people? Show me people. There are no people!
JERRY You know, I think I'll just take the check.
BABU You bad man! You very very bad man!
JERRY Bad man? Could've my mother been wrong?
MONICA Are you looking for George?
ELAINE Well eh, kind of....
MONICA George left.
ELAINE Oh.
MONICA Is that the test?
ELAINE Oh, this...emm...yeah...here you go.
MONICA Thanks. I hope you did do a lot better this time.
ELAINE Actually, you know what, I think I did. The first time I couldn't really cons......entreat.
JERRY You know what it was, bad location.
GEORGE Lets not stand here, we might run in to her.
JERRY Aren't you cold? Where's your jacket?
KRAMER Yeah...
JERRY Oh, I'm sorry.
KRAMER I'm going upstairs.
ELAINE Hey guys, I just ran in to Monica. You know what my IQ is? 151.
JERRY 151?
GEORGE That's a good score.
JERRY So, what are you up for? How about Mexican?
GEORGE Italian.
ELAINE No, Chinese.
JERRY You know, what would be great?
JERRY It's tough to do a good deed. Just look at your professional good deed doers. Your lone rangers, your superman, your Batman, your Spiderman, your Elasticman. They are all wearing disguises, masks over their faces. Secret identities. Don't want people to know who they are. It's too much aggravation. "Superman, thanks for saving my life, but did you have to come through my wall? I'm renting here, I've got a security deposit. What am I supposed to do?"
JERRY Professional tennis. To me I don't understand all the shushing. Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that we're there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't see us watching them? Tennis is basically just ping-pong and the players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. "That'll be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please, shh."
JERRY Are these seats unbelievable or what?
GEORGE Where's the sunblock?
JERRY Here.
GEORGE 25? You don't have anything higher?
JERRY What, are you on Mercury?
GEORGE I need higher. This has paba in it, I need paba-free.
JERRY You got a problem with paba?
GEORGE Yes, I have a problem with paba.
JERRY You don't even know what paba is.
GEORGE I know enough to stay away from it.
GEORGE So are you going to Todd's party this weekend?
JERRY I'll go if someone else drives. You going?
GEORGE Gwen really wants to go.
JERRY You're bringing a date to a party?
GEORGE No good?
JERRY A party is a bad date situation. It doesn't matter who you're with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't want to sit and talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate. Ho, ho, ho.
GEORGE Why'd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting to talk to?
JERRY Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross dressing. Seems like an interesting guy.
GEORGE Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta take her with me. Todd introduced us, I'm obligated.
JERRY That woman is absolutely stunning.
GEORGE The Croat?
JERRY Not the Croat, the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful lineswoman I've ever seen.
GEORGE Yeah, she's a bl.
JERRY bl?
GEORGE Beautiful lineswoman. I'm going to go to the concession stand and get some real sunblock. You want anyting? Jerry? Jerry?
COWORKER You know, I just heard the Lexington line is out.
ELAINE You are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting?
COWORKER Take a car service. We have an account.
ELAINE Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver will not stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach, and the driver is way up there on the stage.
COWORKER Well you're not going to get a cab now. Four thirty in the afternoon? Read a magazine, keep your head down.
ELAINE I guess that could work.
ANNOUNCER And that is it. The match to Ms. Natalia Valdoni. Comming up next, mens single, but for now let's stop a minute and take a look at our beautiful tennis center backdrop.
KRAMER Hey, hey, it's George.
ANNOUNCER Holy cow it's a scorcher. Boy I bet you that guy can cover a lot of court. Hey buddy, they got a new invention. It's called a napkin. We'll take a station break and continue with more...
DRIVER Dag Gavershole Plaza huh? Pendant Publishing, that's books right? Miss?
ELAINE Pardon me?
DRIVER Books, that's what you do?
ELAINE Yeah.
DRIVER Yeah, I don't read much myself, well you know besides the paper. Yeah a lot of people read to relax, but not me. You know what I do?
ELAINE You know I'm having a lot of trouble, um, hearing you back here. So...
DRIVER I said you know what I do when I want to relax? The Jumble. Hey do you make a book of Jumbles?
ELAINE I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf.
DRIVER Going deaf?
ELAINE What?
DRIVER Oh I'm sorry.
ELAINE It can be very frustrating.
DRIVER Hey what about a hearing aid?
ELAINE An I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah sure, who isn't. But you know you gotta live your life.
DRIVER No, no I said. Ehhh, forget it. At the tennis court.
JERRY I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. That lineswoman is absolutely mesmerizing.
GEORGE Boy you are really smitten.
JERRY I gotta talk to her. What do you think?
GEORGE Cold? How are you going to do that? You're not one of those guys.
JERRY I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that just walk across the hot coals.
GEORGE They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the other side.
JERRY I have to. I won't be able to live with myself.
GEORGE Wait a minute Jerry, there's a bigger issue here. If you go through that wall and become one of those guys I'll be left here on this side. Take me with you.
JERRY I can't.
GEORGE What are you going to say?
JERRY I don't know, "Hi".
GEORGE You think you're going to the other side with "Hi"? You're not going to make it. Elaine in the car service car.
RADIO Base to 92 come in
DRIVER Yes this is 92
RADIO After this go back to city for a 6:00 pickup
DRIVER Righteo
RADIO 794 Bleeker the party's Hanks. Tom Hanks.
ELAINE Tom Hanks? After me you're picking up Tom Hanks? I love him.
DRIVER So I guess your hearing goes in and out huh?
ELAINE Yeah. Yes it does...
DRIVER Yeah. You know what I think? I think you made that whole thing up.
ELAINE No no, no no.
DRIVER Yeah yeah, I know your type. You're too good to make conversation with someone like me. Oh god forbid you could discuss the Jumbles. But to go so far as to pretend you're almost deaf, I mean that is truly disgusting. And Mr. Tom Hanks, may I say he too would be disgusted by your behavior.
JERRY Excuse me. Excuse me? Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite. Nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too good for everyone, but it's women like you oh well, what are you deaf?
LAURA Bingo.
KRAMER And you're saying she's deaf.
JERRY I'm not saying she's deaf, she's deaf.
KRAMER Can't hear a thing.
JERRY Can't hear a thing.
KRAMER And you're going to go out with her.
JERRY Yeah, isn't that something?
ELAINE Hey.
JERRY_AND_KRAMER Hey.
KRAMER Hey I know how to sign.
JERRY Really?
KRAMER Yeah when I was 8, I had a deaf cousin who lived with us for about a year. So I haven't been able to do it in a while.
ELAINE What is this about?
JERRY I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.
ELAINE You are kidding. That is amazing. I just took a car service from work and to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf.
JERRY Wow good plan.
ELAINE Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. I know it's terrible, but I'm not a terrible person.
JERRY_AND_KRAMER No.
ELAINE No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say "get out of here". I never ever throw things at them and try to injure them like other people.
JERRY That's nice.
ELAINE Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, you know, because I want to make the freaks feel comfortable.
JERRY That's nice for the freaks.
ELAINE Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I got to a movie so people behind me can see. I've got to make it up to this guy or I won't be able to live with myself. What can I do?
JERRY Why don't you get him some tickets or something, how about that friend of yours that works at the ticket area.
KRAMER Yeah yeah Pete, he can get you great tickets to something. Like a rock concert. Whatever you like.
ELAINE Oh, thanks Kramer.
KRAMER You got it. Hey Jerry, do me a favor. The next time you see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs. I would love to be able to do that.
JERRY Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity. It's ball boys, not ball men. There are no ball men.
ELAINE Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man.
KRAMER Well there ought to be ball men.
JERRY All right I'll talk to her. If you want to be a ball man go ahead, break the ball barrier.
ELAINE Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw George at the tennis match on TV yesterday.
KRAMER Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah he was at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae. He had it all over his face. He was wearing that chocolate on his face like a beard and they got in there real nice and tight. And he's...
GWEN I'm sorry George.
GEORGE I don't understand things were going so great. What happened? Something must have happened.
GWEN It's not you, it's me.
GEORGE You're giving me the "it's not you, it's me" routine? I invented "it's not you, it's me". Nobody tells me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me.
GWEN All right, George, it's you.
GEORGE You're damn right it's me.
GWEN I was just trying to...
GEORGE I know what you were trying to do. Nobody does it better than me.
GWEN I'm sure you do it very well.
GEORGE Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find out.
JERRY But I thought things were going great.
GEORGE Yeah so did I.
JERRY Did she say why?
GEORGE No. She tried to give me the "it's not you, it's me" routine.
JERRY But that's your routine.
GEORGE Yeah. Well aparently word's out.
KRAMER Hey, George, I saw you on TV yesterday.
GEORGE Really? At the tennis match?
KRAMER Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae.
GEORGE Get out of here. I didn't see any cameras there.
KRAMER Oh, the cameras was, vrooom, there. The announcers, they made a couple of cracks about you.
GEORGE Cracks? What were they saying?
KRAMER That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking about how funny you looked.
GEORGE Maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it.
KRAMER Well I'll tell you it wasn't a pretty sight.
GEORGE She must have seen me eating it on TV.
JERRY So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends it? You really think she would be that superficial?
GEORGE Why not. I would be.
JERRY Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye.
GEORGE You're parents saw me on TV?
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE This is nighmare. Kramer how long was I on?
KRAMER It felt like 8 seconds.
GEORGE One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand.
ELAINE I heard you really inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape it?
GEORGE Can we move on?
JERRY He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating the ice cream on TV.
ELAINE Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her.
GEORGE Yes I do.
ELAINE So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.
GEORGE Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there.
KRAMER Well she should be the one that shouldn't go.
JERRY Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral place, who withdraws? What's the ettiquite?
KRAMER Excellent question.
JERRY I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the breakee. He needs to get on with his life.
ELAINE I beg to differ.
JERRY Really.
ELAINE He's the loser. She's the victor. To the victor belong the spoils.
JERRY Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want to fight that traffic on Friday night.
ELAINE Well we can take the car service from my office.
JERRY Really?
ELAINE Yeah, they don't know.
KRAMER All right, I'll see you later.
JERRY Okay.
GEORGE "To the victor goes the spoils." What are you going to do tonight?
JERRY Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman.
GEORGE Oh.
JERRY Why? Well what are you doing?
GEORGE Well I was just going to wander the streets. Wouldn't want to tag along with you or anything.
JERRY Oh, uh, do you want to come with us?
GEORGE Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh, where would we be going?
GEORGE So, I've got ice cream all over my face. There were no napkins there. Whoever it was that's responsible for stocking that concession stand cost me a relationship.
LAURA They never have napkins there.
JERRY Let's get the check. Is this considered signing? Do you do this when you want the check? Really. I know a sign, that's my first sign.
LAURA Uh, oh. That couple is breaking up.
GEORGE They're breaking up? How do you know?
JERRY She reads lips.
GEORGE What are they saying now?
LAURA "It's not you, it's me."
GEORGE Oh my gosh, I just had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read Gwen's lips for me.
JERRY What?
GEORGE We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen is saying about me.
JERRY She's not a novelty act, George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas.
GEORGE Look. It's a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off.
JERRY I don't know George. I'm not sure about this.
GEORGE Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case closed.
JERRY All right.
JERRY Uh Laura, George was wondering if...
LAURA Sure. I'll do it.
JERRY So I really had a good time.
LAURA Yeah, me too.
JERRY So you want to go to the party on Friday night?
LAURA Yeah.
JERRY All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by and pick you up. How about six? . Six is good. . You got a problem with six? . What? What?
MAN Okay listen up people. There are plenty of you here, but we've only got two spots to fill. Good luck.
BOY Hey pops, isn't there a better way to spend your twilight years?
KRAMER I may be old, but I'm spry.
BOY The tryout lasts three and a half to four hours. Are you up for it?
KRAMER Oh I'll be up for it punk.
JERRY See I was saying "six" but she thought I was saying "sex". We straightened the whole thing out though.
GEORGE She confused "six" with "sex"?
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE Well if she can't tell "six" from "sex" then how is she going to lip read from across the room?
JERRY Well "six" and "sex" are close.
GEORGE It's two completely different sounds. "ih" and "eh".
JERRY Eh.
GEORGE It seems like a problem.
JERRY Well I'm not dating any other deaf women.
KRAMER Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals.
JERRY You're kidding.
KRAMER Yeah. They said they haven't seen anybody go after balls with such gusto.
GEORGE When is that car service comming?
JERRY In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there.
GEORGE If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your friend.
JERRY I know. It's like X-ray vision.
GEORGE If we could just harness this power and use it for our own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us.
NEWMAN I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day.
JERRY Can't do it Newman.
NEWMAN But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me two hours.
JERRY Not going to happen.
NEWMAN All right, all right. All right you go ahead. You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you control the mail, you control... information.
JERRY Oh just pull over right there by the stop sign.
DRIVER Pardon me sir?
JERRY I said pull over by the stop sign.
DRIVER I'm so sorry, you'll have to forgive me. I can't hear a damn thing. I went to that rock concert last night at the garden. My seats were right up agains the speaker. It's a heavy metal group. Metalla-something.
KRAMER -ca.
DRIVER Huh?
GEORGE What?
JERRY ca.
GEORGE ah.
DRIVER My ears are still ringing. Some woman's idea of a joke.
DRIVER Get out. Get out. Go on. Hey. Shut the door.
JERRY You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night.
JERRY I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs, check, and late. Hey this is the guy you helped become the first ball man.
KRAMER She doesn't know what she's talking about.
TODD Guys you made it.
GEORGE Hey hey.
TODD Sorry to hear about Gwen.
GEORGE Why? Did she say something to you about why she broke up with me?
TODD Oh no. Tonight will be the first chance I've had to talk to her. Look George, I'm friends with both of you. I can't betray her confidence by telling you anything.
GEORGE I wouldn't hear of it, huh. It's none of my business. You should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll even stay all the way on the other side of the room so there's no chance of me overhearing anything.
TODD You are so centered.
GEORGE Let's go, let's go. All right what are they saying?
KRAMER "Hi Gwen, hi tide."
JERRY Hi tide?
KRAMER Hi Todd.
KRAMER "You've got something between your teeth"
GEORGE What?
KRAMER No that's what he said. "That's interesting. I love carrots, but I hate carrot soup. And I hate peas, but I love pea soup." So do I.
ELAINE She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow afternoon?
JERRY No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody.
GWEN I don't envy you Todd. The place is going to be a mess.
TODD Maybe you can stick around after everybody leaves and we can sweep together.
KRAMER "Why don't you stick around and we can sleep together."
GEORGE What?
KRAMER "You want me to sleep with you?"
TODD I don't want to sweep alone.
KRAMER He says "I don't want to sleep alone." She says, oh boy, "love to."
GEORGE So you're getting rid of me and now the two of you are going to sleep together?
GWEN What? You're crazy.
KRAMER "What? You're crazy."
GEORGE I heard your whole conversation.
GWEN How?
KRAMER "How?"
GEORGE I can read lips. You said let's sleep together.
GWEN No I didn't. I said "sweep". Let's sweep together, you know with a broom. Cleaning up.
KRAMER "... with a broom, cleaning up."
GEORGE Sweep?
GWEN Yes sweep.
KRAMER "Yes sweep."
GEORGE Cut it.
KRAMER George says "Cut it."
GEORGE Cut it.
KRAMER George is saying "Cut it."
GEORGE Cut it. Would you stop signing? She said "sweep together" you idiots, not "sleep together."
KRAMER I know how to sign.
GEORGE Ow. My eye, my eye.
ELAINE It's so amazing getting to see Monica Sellas playing in the finals.
JERRY I know and on the first tournament of her comeback.
JERRY Thus ends the great ball man experiment.
DRIVER You with the tennis center?
LAURA Yep.
DRIVER Hey how about that ball man injuring Monica Sellas. Wasn't that something.
LAURA I'm deaf.
DRIVER Oh.
JERRY The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what you're doing. Did you ever see anybody on TV like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their commercial people - where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them? "We have soda, we have soda, we have soda", jumping, laughing, flying through the air - it's a can of soda. Have you ever been standing there and you're watching TV and you're drinking the exact same product that they're advertising right there on TV, and it's like, you know, they're spiking volleyballs, jetskiing, girls in bikinis and I'm standing there - "Maybe I'm putting too much ice in mine."
GEORGE So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there, and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasn't sure if she wanted me to ask her out, because when women smile at me I don't know what it means. Sometimes I interpret it like they're Psychotic or something and I don't know if I'm supposed to smile back, I don't know what to do. So I just stood there like - remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? - that's what I looked like.
JERRY So you didn't ask?
GEORGE No, I froze.
JERRY Counter.
GEORGE Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later I'm back in the office, I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says "So why don't you call her". I says "I can't." I couldn't, I couldn't do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks. So Lloyd calls me a wuss.
JERRY He said wuss?
GEORGE Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it.
JERRY So you called.
GEORGE Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple, because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it makes you sound casual.
JERRY Yeah, like a farm boy.
GEORGE Right. So I call her up, I tell her it's me, she gives me an enthusiastic 'Hi!'
JERRY Wow. Enthusiastic 'Hi!', that's beautiful.
GEORGE Oh, I don't get the enthusiastic 'Hi!', I'm outta there.
JERRY Alright, so you're chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic 'Hi!' Go ahead.
GEORGE So, we're talking, and I don't like to go too long before I ask them out, I wanna get it over with right away, so I just blurt out "What are you doing Saturday night?"
JERRY And?
GEORGE She bought.
JERRY Great day in the morning.
GEORGE Then I got off the phone right away.
JERRY Sure, it's like robbing a bank: you don't loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out.
GEORGE It's amazing: we, we both have dates on the same night. I can't remember the last time that happened.
GEORGE I can't stand doing laundry. That's why I have forty pairs of underwear.
CAROL You do not.
GEORGE Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. That way, I only have to do wash once a year.
JERRY Come on, try it. Let me hear you try a Scottish accent.
DONNA That's Irish.
JERRY Irish, Scottish, what's the difference, lassie?
DONNA So, er, thanks for dinner. It was great.
GEORGE Yeah. We should do this again.
DONNA Would you like to come upstairs for some coffee?
GEORGE Oh, no, thanks. I can't drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up.
DONNA So, um, ok.
GEORGE ok.
DONNA Goodnight.
GEORGE Yeah, take it easy.
DONNA Thanks again for the movie.
JERRY You're welcome.
DONNA I'd invite you up, but the place is being painted.
JERRY Oh, that's ok.
DONNA Unless you want to go to your place.
JERRY ok, but there's no cake or anything, if that's what you're looking for.
GEORGE Take it easy, huh, take it easy.
JERRY I think if one's going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note - it's common courtesy. I don't know, that's just the way I was brought up.
DONNA Values are very important.
JERRY Oh, so important. So what are you doing Thursday night - you wanna have dinner?
DONNA Thursday's great.
JERRY Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? I don't feel comfortable in them.
DONNA Are those Cotton Dockers?
JERRY Oh, I can't begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.
DONNA Really? I like that commercial.
JERRY You like that commercial?
DONNA Yeah, it's clever.
JERRY Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing around, supposedly being very casual and witty?
DONNA Yeah, that's the one.
JERRY What could you possibly like about that?
DONNA I don't know, I like the guys.
JERRY Yeah, they're so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.
DONNA Hey, I know guys like that. To me the dialogue rings true.
JERRY Even if the dialogue did ring true. Even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with the pants? Doesn't that bother you?
DONNA That's the idea. That's what's clever about it, that they're not talking about the pants.
JERRY But they're talking about nothing.
DONNA That's the point.
JERRY I know the point.
DONNA No one is telling you to like it.
JERRY I mean, all those quick shots of the pants, just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?
JERRY What's brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guy'll be like 'I don't think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life?' And of course the woman's looking at the guy, thinking 'What is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my life?'
JERRY I'm supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with someone who actually likes this commercial?
ELAINE I once broke up with a guy because he didn't keep his bathroom clean enough.
JERRY No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?
ELAINE Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his tub germs were building a town in there - they were constructing offices. Houses near the drain were going for $150,000.
ELAINE Hi.
JERRY You're still thinking about this?
GEORGE She invites me up at twelve o clock at night, for coffee. And I don't go up. "No thank you, I don't want coffee, it keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee." I said this to her. People this stupid shouldn't be allowed to live. I can't imagine what she must think of me.
JERRY She thinks you're a guy that doesn't like coffee.
GEORGE She invited me up. Coffee's not coffee, coffee is sex.
ELAINE Maybe coffee was coffee.
GEORGE Coffee's coffee in the morning, it's not coffee at twelve o clock at night.
ELAINE Well some people drink coffee that late.
GEORGE Yeah, people who work at NORAD, who're on twenty-four hour missile kept saying to myself "Keep it up, don't blow it, you're doing great."
ELAINE It's all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I think you should call her.
GEORGE I can't call her now, it's too soon. I'm planning a Wednesday call.
ELAINE Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day.
GEORGE Of course you do, but you're imagining a guy you like, not a guy who goes "Oh no, I don't drink coffee late at night." If I call her now, she's gonna think I'm too needy. Women don't wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy - a colonel, a kaiser, a tsar.
ELAINE All she'll think is that you like her.
GEORGE Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me, but she doesn't like me!
ELAINE I don't know what your parents did to you.
KRAMER Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. Alright, you're up there, you're on the stage and you go "Hey, you ever notice how cars here in New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore. Someone's in a life-and-death situation, and we're thinking 'Well, sorry buddy, you should've thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years.'" So you gonna use it?
JERRY I don't think so.
KRAMER It's funny.
ELAINE It is funny.
KRAMER That's as good as anything you do.
GEORGE Alright, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on.
JERRY Why do we have to leave?
GEORGE Because I can't call a woman with other people in the room. Come on, let's go.
ELAINE Oh, see, this is the problem.
JERRY You're kicking me out of my house?
GEORGE Yes.
ELAINE Don't forget.
GEORGE Oh Jerry, do you have any apples?
JERRY Don't do the apples. That's enough already with the apples.
ANSWERING_MACHINE Hi, it's Carol, I 'll get back to you.
GEORGE Uhm, hi, it's George, George Costanza, remember me? The guy that didn't come up for coffee. You see, I didn't realise that coffee didn't really mean ... well, whatever. Anyway, it was fun. It was, erm, it was fun, so, oh boy, uhm, so, you call me back. If you want, it's up to you, you know, whatever you wanna do. Either way. The ball's in your court. So, er, take it easy.
JERRY I'm just gonna get my jacket, I'll meet you downstairs. What's the matter, did you call?
GEORGE Got her machine. I'm dead, I'm a dead man. That's it. I'm dead, I'm a dead man. Dead man.
JERRY What did you say?
GEORGE I don't know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and there's nothing I can do. It's a machine. The little light is blinking right now Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiot's on!'
JERRY After one date you try and improvise on her machine?
GEORGE Now I'm in the worst position of all.
ELAINE Y'know, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guy's machine, and he blurted out some business information he wasn't supposed to, and it would have cost him $15,000, so he waited outside the guy's house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape.
GEORGE He did that?
ELAINE Yeah.
GEORGE Somebody did that?
JERRY She'll call you back. You're overreacting.
JERRY Not once.
DONNA Never?
JERRY I have never seen one episode of 'I Love Lucy' in my life ever.
DONNA That's amazing.
JERRY Thank you.
DONNA Is there anything else about you I should know?
JERRY Yes, I'm lactose intolerant.
DONNA Really?
JERRY I have no patience for lactose. And I won't stand for it. Uhm, I'll be right back.
GEORGE Wait till you hear this . Whoa, ah, I'm sorry, I didn't, I had no idea.
DONNA Wait, wait. He's in the bathroom.
GEORGE I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but I'll come back.
DONNA You don't have to leave.
GEORGE You sure?
DONNA Yes.
GEORGE ok.
DONNA I'm Donna.
GEORGE Donna. Oh, you're the one that likes that commercial!
DONNA He told you about that.
GEORGE No, he, he didn't actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about that commercial, in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial. No, he, he would never tell me anything like that. He never discusses anything. He's, he's like a clam. You're not gonna mention this, to him..
DONNA So you go around telling your friends I'm not hip because I like that commercial.
JERRY What? What did, what did you say?
GEORGE Say? What? Nothing, I..
DONNA You told him how I like the commercial.
JERRY Well, so what if I said that?
DONNA Well, so, you didn't have to tell your friends.
JERRY No, I had to tell my friends, my friends didn't have to tell you.
GEORGE Why did you have to get me in trouble?
DONNA I don't like you talking about me with your friends behind my back.
GEORGE Boy oh boy.
JERRY I said I couldn't believe you liked that commercial. So what?
DONNA I asked some friends of mine this week, and all of them liked the commercial.
JERRY Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Oh, Kramer, this is Donna.
KRAMER Oh. Cotton Dockers!
GEORGE Hello! Alright, we should be going. Come on .
KRAMER What? Where are we going?
GEORGE Come on!
DONNA Don't bother, I'm leaving.
JERRY Donna, really, you're making too much of this.
KRAMER One hundred percent Cotton Dockers, if they're not Dockers, they're just pants!
JERRY Please, Donna.
DONNA I don't wanna hear it.
GEORGE I can't believe I said that. You know me, I'm a vault.
JERRY Don't worry about it, it wasn't working anyway.
KRAMER What happened there?
JERRY I'll tell you later.
GEORGE You are not gonna believe what's going on with this woman.
GEORGE ok, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesn't call back. I call again Monday, I leave another message. I call Tuesday, I get the machine again "I know you're there, I don't know what your story is." Yesterday, I'm a volcano - I try one more call, the machine comes on, and fly like Mussolini from the balcony- "Where the hell do you get the nerve? You invite me up for coffee and then you don't call me back for four days? I don't like coffee, I don't have to come up. I'd like to get one more shot at the coffee just so I could spit it in your face."
JERRY You said that?
GEORGE I lost it.
JERRY I can't blame you. I can't believe she never called you back.
GEORGE She did. Today.
JERRY What?
GEORGE She called my office. She said she's been in the Hamptons since Sunday. She didn't know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine broke, and she's been using her old machine and she doesn't have the beeper for it.
JERRY So she didn't get the messages.
GEORGE Exactly, but they're on there waiting. She said she can't wait to see me, we're having dinner tonight. She's supposed to call me as soon as she gets home.
JERRY But what about the messages?
JERRY Elaine's thing? How you gonna get in?
GEORGE I'll meet her outside the building.
JERRY But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment she's going right for that machine.
GEORGE Or she goes for the bathroom. That's my only chance. Who am I kidding? I can't do this, I can't do this. I don't even know how to work those stupid machines.
JERRY There's nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right out.
GEORGE You do it for me.
JERRY What?
GEORGE Come on, it'll be so much easier.
JERRY How you gonna get me up there?
GEORGE I'll tell her I bumped into you, I'm giving you a ride uptown.
JERRY And who makes the switch?
GEORGE You do.
JERRY I do.
GEORGE I can't do it. I'll, I'll keep her busy.
JERRY I can't get involved in this.
GEORGE I think I may be in love with this woman.
JERRY What if she sees me?
GEORGE Oh, you are such a wuss.
JERRY A wuss?
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY Did you call me a wuss?
GEORGE Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.
JERRY I got one problem: you're keeping her busy in the other room. Now, what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me that she's coming.
GEORGE A signal, right, erm, ok, er ok, the signal is, I'll call out 'Tippy toe!'
JERRY 'Tippy Toe?' I don't think so.
GEORGE You don't like 'Tippy toe?'
JERRY No 'Tippy toe.'
GEORGE Alright, er, ok I got it, erm, I'll sing.
JERRY What song?
GEORGE Erm, 'How do you solve a problem like Maria?'
JERRY What is that?
GEORGE Oh, it's a lovely song. How do you solve a problem like Maria?
JERRY Anything else?
GEORGE You pick it.
JERRY 'Lemon Tree'
GEORGE Peter, Paul and Mary.
JERRY No, Trini Lopez.
JERRY_AND_GEORGE Lemon tree very pretty and a lemon flower
GEORGE You got the tape?
JERRY Standard. Micro.
GEORGE How do you feel? Confident?
JERRY Feel good.
GEORGE You nervous?
JERRY Not at all.
GEORGE Get up, get up, it's her. Oh, the hell with this, I'm scared to death, just walk away, it's off, cancel everything, go!
GEORGE Hey! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to call you when I got home.
GEORGE I, I couldn't wait. I was too anxious to see you.
CAROL Oh, that's so sweet.
GEORGE Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him around the corner. Isn't that a coincidence? The funny thing is, I see him all the time.
JERRY All the time.
CAROL It's nice to meet you.
JERRY Hi.
CAROL So, I'm starving. Where are we gonna eat?
GEORGE You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a ride home.
CAROL ok. Let's go, I'm ready, where'd you park?
GEORGE Don't you wanna go upstairs first?
CAROL No, what for? I'll just give my bag to the doorman.
JERRY You know, I really need to use the bathroom.
CAROL Oh well there's a bathroom in the coffee shop just next door.
GEORGE Yes, yes, but er, I have to make a call, so...
CAROL Well they have a phone.
GEORGE I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we really should go upstairs.
CAROL You know, I think I will go upstairs. I can check my machine.
GEORGE Right, right.
CAROL The bathroom's on the hall to the right.
JERRY Er, you know, why don't you go first, you just had a long trip.
CAROL No, I'm fine.
JERRY Uhmmm, you know, it's the damnedest thing, it went away.
CAROL Oh that's weird.
GEORGE No, no that can happen. I've, er, I've read about that in medical journals. It's a freak thing, but...
CAROL Well, let me just check my messages, and we'll go.
GEORGE Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now.
CAROL Sure.
GEORGE Please, this is very, very important.
GEORGE Uhh, tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon tree!
CAROL Now I know who you are. You're a comedian. I've seen you, it's driving me crazy.
JERRY Right. I am.
GEORGE Carol, that's so rude. Please, I'm serious, just for a moment, if you wouldn't mind, and then we'll talk to Jerry.
JERRY Hey you two. I'm ready to go.
CAROL That's what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers in the pool?
GEORGE Don't you find that strange?
JERRY Yes.
CAROL Well, I'll just check my machine and we'll go. No, nothing here, let's go. Oh, I forgot to tell you. After I talked to you today my neighbour called me and played my messages to me over the phone.
GEORGE Oh, uhhh...
CAROL Yours were hilarious, we were both cracking up. I just love jokes like that.
JERRY I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw somebody on the street I didn't want to talk to I could go "Excuse me, I'm not in right now. If you could just leave a message, I could walk away." I also have a cordless phone, but I don't like that as much, because you can't slam down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone - "You can't talk to me like that!" Bang! You know. You get mad at somebody on a cordless phone - "You can't talk to me like that!" "I told him!"
JERRY Monkeys are really the end of the line in the pet world. I think when you're at the monkey level of pet ownership, have a kid. I mean, come on, you know, I mean, you're so close. If you need a pet that can roller skate and smoke cigars, it's time to think about a family. Monkeys, of course, were the first astronauts in the sixties, which I'm sure made perfect sense in the monkey brain. 'Maybe that is the next logical step for me, because I've been working with the Italian guy and the crank organ, and I think I'm ready to handle the maximum re-entry g-forces.
GEORGE Take toilet paper for example. Do you realize that toilet paper has not changed in my lifetime? It's just paper on a cardboard roll, that's it. And in ten thousand years, it will still be exactly the same because really, what else can they do?
SIENA That's true. There really has been no development in toilet paper.
GEORGE And everything else has changed. But toilet paper is exactly the same, and will be so until we're dead.
SIENA Yeah, you're right George. What else can they do?
GEORGE It's just paper on a roll, that's it. And that's all it will ever be.
SIENA Wow.
GEORGE You find this interesting, don't you?
SIENA Yes. yes, I do.
ELAINE Oh, thanks very much, the soup was really good.
JERRY What are you telling him for?
ELAINE What?
JERRY He's the busboy, you think he cares about the soup?
ELAINE Yeah, why? Wouldn't he want the soup to be good?
JERRY Elaine, it's all this guy can do to keep from killing himself. You think he's back there, talking to the chef, going, "Hey, they like the soup!Keep it up!"?
ELAINE Hey, isn't that Alec Berg?
JERRY Yep, Alec Berg. He's got a good 'John Houseman' name. Alec Beeerg. Mr. Beeerg.
ELAINE I can't stand him, he is so pretentious.
JERRY John Houseman?
ELAINE No, Alec Berg.
ALEC Elaine!
ELAINE Hi!
ALEC Hi, how are you? Jerry.
JERRY Hi, Alec.
ALEC Did you hear about Gary Fogel?
JERRY Yeah.
ALEC You gonna go to the funeral on Friday?
JERRY Yeah, hey did I see you on TV at the Ranger game? Were those your seats right behind the glass?
ALEC Those are them, yeah. Season tickets. Uh, you know, unfortunately I can't go tonight, so they're available if you'd like to use them.
JERRY Oh, I'd love to, are you sure?
ALEC Absolutely, you just call my secretary, she'll arrange everything.
JERRY Gee thanks! Thanks a lot!
ALEC It's my pleasure. Be good. You know, I actually might not use them on Friday either so I'll let you know.
JERRY Alright, thanks again.
ELAINE Thank you very much.
JERRY Really, thank you.
JERRY Well what about these nitwits that get on a plane with nothing to read? You know who these people are?
ELAINE Who?
JERRY These are the people that want to talk to you. They got nothing else to do, why not disturb you?
ELAINE I will never understand people.
JERRY They're the worst.
GEORGE Something's up, there's something in the air.
JERRY Well, what is with you?
GEORGE Well, I think this is it.
ELAINE What's it?
GEORGE I saw Siena again.
ELAINE Siena?
JERRY Yeah, he's dating a crayon.
GEORGE We discussed toilet paper.
JERRY Toilet paper?
GEORGE Yeah, I told her how toilet paper hasn't changed in my lifetime, and probably wouldn't change in the next fifty thousand years and she was fascinated, fascinated!
JERRY What are you talking about?
ELAINE Yeah.
JERRY Toilet paper's changed.
ELAINE Yeah.
JERRY It's softer.
ELAINE Softer.
JERRY More sheets per roll
ELAINE Sheets.
JERRY Comes in a wide variety of colors.
ELAINE Colors.
GEORGE Ok, ok, fine! It's changed, it's not really the point. Anyway, I'm thinking of making a big move.
JERRY What?
GEORGE I might tell her that I love her. I came this close last night, then I just chickened out.
JERRY Well, that's a big move, Georgie boy. Are you confident in the 'I love you' return?
GEORGE Fifty-fifty.
JERRY Cause if you don't get that return, that's a pretty big matzoh ball hanging out there.
GEORGE Aw, I've just got to say it once, everybody else gets to say it, why can't I say it?
ELAINE What, you never said it?
GEORGE Once, to a dog. He licked himself and left the room.
JERRY Well, so it wasn't a total loss.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey, I forgot to tell you! I got tickets to the Rangers-Devils playoff game tonight!
KRAMER Oh, I'm there, Monongahela!
JERRY What about you, George?
GEORGE Eh eh eh, can't do it, can't do it, sorry, I got a date.
KRAMER So, so.
GEORGE Oh no no no, if you must know, I would rather be with her than go to the game.
KRAMER She must be a very special lady, huh George, yeah.
JERRY Well, what do I do with the extra ticket?
ELAINE Oh hey, can I bring David Puddy? He's a big Devils' fan.
JERRY Sure, fine with me.
GEORGE Hey, by the way, if anybody wants an inside tour of the zoo, Siena works there as a trainer.
KRAMER So she works at the zoo?
GEORGE Yeah, yeah.
KRAMER Yeah, like Diane Fosse. You know she's the only person that's ever been accepted into gorilla society. And you know, once those gorillas accept you, you got it made in the shade.
ELAINE So how long have you been a Devils' fan?
PUDDY Since I was a kid, I'm from Jersey.
ELAINE Yeah? Well, we're gonna kick your butts tonight.
PUDDY Hey, no way, man.
ELAINE Yes.
PUDDY We're primed.
ELAINE Alright, you almost ready? Cause Jerry and Kramer are gonna be here any second.
ELAINE What the--
PUDDY So what do you think?
ELAINE What is that?
PUDDY I painted my face.
ELAINE You painted your face?
PUDDY Yeah.
ELAINE Why?
PUDDY You know, support the team.
ELAINE Well, you can't walk around like that.
PUDDY Why not?
ELAINE Because it's insane?
PUDDY Hey, you gotta let them know you're out there, this is the playoffs.
KRAMER Hey.
PUDDY Hey.
ELAINE Dave, um, painted his face.
KRAMER Yeah, that's cool. Well, you gotta support your team.
PUDDY Ok, ready to go?
KRAMER Yeah.
PUDDY Let's get it on! Alright!! Go Devils!! Go Devils!! Let's go Devils!!
PUDDY You're dead, Messier! We're gonna get you, Messier!
FAN_1 Will you sit down?
PUDDY Hey man, I'm just trying to support the team.
ELAINE Will you sit down? You're disturbing everybody. Sit down!
PUDDY Oh yeah, because you're a Ranger fan and you know I'm messing with their heads.
PUDDY Go Devils!!
RADIO_ANNOUNCER Devils goal! Stephan Richer scores from just inside the blue line! And the Devils take--
GEORGE You know, I could have actually gone to that.
SIENA So why didn't you?
GEORGE Well, I didn't want to break our date.
SIENA Oh, well.
GEORGE Because I... I love you.
SIENA You know, I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.
PUDDY Ha ha! We took it to you! You couldn't get it out of your zone all night. We were aggressive, we didn't let you penetrate!
KRAMER Alright, that's enough out of you, there's still three more games left in this series, my friend, and it's far from being over. Very far from being over. Watch out!
PUDDY Hey, what are you doing?! Watch where you're driving, man! Don't mess with the Devils, buddy. We're number one, we beat anybody! We're the Devils! The Devils!! Haaaa!!!
FATHER_HERNANDEZ El Diablo! Dios mio! El Diablo!!
JERRY "I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat."
GEORGE Yup.
JERRY Big matzoh ball.
GEORGE Huge matzoh ball.
JERRY Those damn 'I love you' returns.
GEORGE Well, it's all over. I slipped up.
JERRY Oh, you don't know.
GEORGE You have any idea how fast these things deteriorate when there's an 'I love you' out of the bag? You can't have a relationship where one person says, "I love you", and the other says, "I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.".
JERRY Unless you're married.
GEORGE I mean, now she thinks that I'm one of these guys that love her. Nobody wants to be with somebody that loves them.
JERRY No, people hate that.
GEORGE You want to be with somebody that doesn't like you.
JERRY Ideally.
GEORGE I am never saying 'I love you' again unless they say it first.
WAITRESS Matzoh ball soup?
GEORGE That'd be me.
KRAMER Hey, Jerry? You're a smart guy, right?
JERRY No question about it.
KRAMER Alright, you know I'm supposed to go on this special tour today with George's girlfriend.
JERRY At the zoo?
KRAMER Yeah, but before I met up with her, I stopped to look at the monkeys, when all of a sudden I am hit in the face with a banana peel. I turn and look and there is this monkey really laughing it up. Then someone tells me that he did it. Well, I pick up the banana peel and I wait for that monkey to turn around. And then I whap let him have it.
JERRY Kramer, you threw a banana peel at a monkey?
KRAMER Well, he started it!
JERRY It's a monkey, Kramer!
KRAMER Well, he pushed my buttons, I couldn't help it, Jerry.
JERRY Well, I still think it's wrong.
KRAMER Alright, alright, fine. You take the monkey's side, alright, go ahead.
JERRY I'm not taking anyone's side.
KRAMER Cause I know what happened, Jerry. Did you call Alec Berg and thank him for the hockey tickets?
JERRY No.
KRAMER Oh, Jerry, what are you waiting for?
JERRY What do I gotta call him for? I thanked him five times when he gave them to me, how many time I gotta thank him?
KRAMER Oh, no no no, you gotta call him the next day, it's common courtesy.
JERRY No, I don't believe in it. I'm taking a stand against all this over thanking.
KRAMER Jerry, good manners are the glue of society.
JERRY Hey, if I knew I had to give him eight million 'thank you's, I wouldn't have taken the tickets in the first place.
KRAMER Alright, you know what this is gonna do? He's gonna be upset because you didn't call him and we're not gonna get those tickets for Friday night.
JERRY Ah, you're out of your mind.
KRAMER Alright, where you going?
JERRY I gotta get a suit cleaned, I have a funeral on Friday.
KRAMER Who died?
JERRY Remember the guy who pretended he had cancer so I would buy him the toupee?
KRAMER So he actually had it?
JERRY No, car accident. He was trying to adjust his toupee while he was driving and he lost control of the car.
ELAINE That poor priest. He was just visiting from El Salvador. Now he's gone completely loco.
JERRY The one Puddy screamed at in the car?
ELAINE Yeah. He thinks he saw the devil. He won't leave his room in the church basement.
JERRY Well, that's what you get for getting mixed up with a face painter.
ELAINE I mean, what compels a seemingly normal human being to do something like that?
JERRY Gotta support the team.
ELAINE You know I really hate my clothes.
JERRY Hm.
ELAINE I open up my closet, there's just nothing.
JERRY Hm.
ELAINE Nothing. I hate everything I have, I really hate it. I mean, at this point, it's like I can wear something three or four times and that's it.
JERRY Hm.
ELAINE It's getting to be a terrible problem for me. Jerry Hey, Alec!
JERRY Did you see that? What kind of a 'hello' was that?
MR._PLESS Ah, Mr. Kramer?
KRAMER Yes.
MR._PLESS Thanks for coming.
KRAMER So, uh, what did you want to see me about?
MR._PLESS Well, Mr. Kramer, to get right to it, we're having a bit of a problem with Barry.
KRAMER Barry?
MR._PLESS The chimpanzee.
KRAMER Oh. Well, uh, what's the problem?
MR._PLESS Well, he's not functioning the way he normally does. He seems depressed. He's lost his appetite. He's even curtailed his autoerotic activities. And we think this is directly related to the altercation he had with you the other day.
KRAMER So, so what do you want me to do?
MR._PLESS Well, frankly we'd like you to apologize.
KRAMER Yeah, well he started it.
MR._PLESS Mr. Kramer, he is an innocent primate.
KRAMER So am I. What about my feelings? Don't my feelings count for anything? Oh, only the poor monkey's important. Everything has to be done for the monkey! Look, I'm sorry. I--
SIENA Hey, that's ok. Well, I've gotta go feed the marmosets.
KRAMER You know George really likes you.
MR._PLESS She doesn't hear too well out of her left ear.
KRAMER Oh.
JERRY I mean, do you think it's possible that he's mad at me because he didn't get the day-after 'thank you'?
GEORGE Wait a minute, you were at a funeral, right?
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE Well, people never give a good 'hello' at a funeral. I mean, they go like this That's the biggest.
JERRY Yeah, yeah, that's kinda what he gave me.
GEORGE Hey, they can't go, "Hey! You look fabulous!"
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER Hey. Well, I just spoke to your girlfriend.
GEORGE Girlfriend, yeah, right.
KRAMER Anyway, she asked me to apologize to Barry.
GEORGE Barry?
KRAMER The monkey.
JERRY Well?
KRAMER Nothing doing. Jerry, I didn't do anything. It's the monkey that should be apologizing to me.
JERRY Well, I don't think that's gonna happen.
KRAMER Well, I'm sorry. Well, George, I tried to put the good word in for you with Siena, but I don't think she heard me. You know, left ear?
GEORGE What?
KRAMER Yeah, her boss told me that she can't hear very well out of her left ear. What, you didn't know that?
GEORGE Oh my god.
JERRY What?
GEORGE She probably never heard it. Don't you see what this means? It's like the whole thing never happened. It's like when Superman reversed the rotation of the earth to save Lois Lane!
JERRY Are you gonna say it again?
GEORGE That's the question, Jimmy.
GEORGE I'm gonna do it.
JERRY What? After what you just went through, I thought you said you'd never say it again.
GEORGE I'd like to say it once to someone that can actually hear it!
KRAMER What's going on?
JERRY He's gonna talk into her other ear.
KRAMER Oh. Well listen, I almost forgot to ask you. What happened at the funeral? Now, did you talk to Alec berg?
JERRY Yeah, I saw him.
KRAMER Alright, so he's gonna give you the hockey tickets, huh?
JERRY Well, not exactly.
KRAMER He's mad, isn't he? See, I knew it.
JERRY I don't know if he's mad.
KRAMER Alright, so what happened when you saw him?
JERRY Well, I didn't really get a good 'hello', but see, I was at a funeral.
KRAMER Uh huh.
JERRY See, so I don't know if I got a funeral 'hello' or he was mad because he didn't get his day-after 'thank you'.
KRAMER See, I told you, Jerry, I told you!
JERRY Look, what do you want me to do?
KRAMER I want you to get on this phone and give him his 'thank you'!
JERRY No. No, I can't!
KRAMER Jerry, this is the way society functions. Aren't you a part of society? Because if you don't want to be a part of society, Jerry, why don't you just get in your car and move to the East Side!
JERRY Look, we got five hours before the game. I am betting it was a funeral 'hello'. He knows we're here, he knows the number, he knows we want to go. There's plenty of time for him to call and give us the tickets.
KRAMER You stubborn, stupid, silly man!
PUDDY Hey, great dip. You made this?
ELAINE No, it's from the store.
PUDDY Oh. Hey, how come people don't have dip for dinner? Why is it only a snack, why can't it be a meal, you know? I don't understand stuff like that.
ELAINE David? David, I think we aught to talk.
PUDDY Alright, that's cool.
ELAINE David, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
PUDDY You gotta be kidding, how come?
ELAINE Well, you see, David, you're a face painter.
PUDDY Yeah, that's right.
ELAINE Well, it's not that I don't like you, but, well to be perfectly honest, I'm just having some trouble getting past the face painting.
PUDDY Well, alright, so you don't like the face painting, I just won't paint it anymore.
ELAINE Yeah, but you like the face painting.
PUDDY Well, I don't need to do it. It's not like a habit or anything.
ELAINE Oh. You mean you'd stop it for me?
PUDDY Yeah, that's right.
ELAINE That's so, that's so sweet.
PUDDY Ah, c'mere. Alright, I gotta go home and get changed before the game. I'll be back, we'll make out.
GEORGE Siena, I love you.
SIENA Yeah, I know. I heard you the first time.
GEORGE Yeah. Just confirming.
JERRY Hello? Oh, hi mom. No, listen, I was expecting somebody else. I'm sorry, I can't talk now, I gotta keep the line clear, I'll call you later. Yes, I know I have call waiting but I don't trust it in an emergency. Good bye.
KRAMER Anyway, I um, I just want to say that I'm sorry. I lost my temper and I probably shouldn't have. I took it out on you and, look, if I've caused you any problems as a result of my behavior, well then, I'm sorry. I apologize. Even though, Barry, between me and you, we both know that you started it. I mean, who's kidding who? But they tell me that you're very upset, and god forbid I should disturb the very important monkey, I'm just hoping we can put this behind us, let's just move on with our lives, ok? So no hard feelings?
ELAINE What is that?
PUDDY That's the letter 'D'.
ELAINE Why is the letter 'D' painted on your chest?
PUDDY Well, I'm going to the game tonight, and me and these five other guys are gonna take our shirts off and spell out 'Devils'.
ELAINE But you said no more painting.
PUDDY No, I said no more face painting, and as you can see this is not my face.
ELAINE Yeah, that's right.
KRAMER Well? Did he call?
JERRY No.
KRAMER Oh, come on, Jerry! Come on, this is stupid! It's six o'clock! It's all over, just pick up the phone and thank him!
JERRY Alright! Hello, Alec? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. You know, you got a great 'John Houseman' name. Alec Berg. Did you hand in your assignment, Mr. Berg?
ALEC What can I do for you, Jerry?
JERRY Well, Alec, the reason I called is I just wanted to thank you for the tickets from the other night.
ALEC I wish you'd called me earlier, I could have given you my tickets for tonight.
JERRY Oh, you already gave them away?
ALEC Yeah, but you know what? I have a friend, he's got a couple of seats. If you don't mind the nose bleed section, they're yours.
JERRY No, we don't care, we just want to go.
ALEC There is one little catch, though.
PUDDY Hey, great game, huh?
PRIEST Father Hernandez?
FATHER_HERNANDEZ Huh?
PRIEST Una senora que te vino a ver. Ella dice que tiene informacion muy important information that could be helpful to you.
FATHER_HERNANDEZ Bueno.
PRIEST Al fini finalmente par el llover.
FATHER_HERNANDEZ Aha, bueno. The priest shows Elaine into the room, she's wearing a white raincoat with a hood. As she approaches the bed, she's backlit by the sunlight coming through the window.
ELAINE Hello father.
FATHER_HERNANDEZ Oh. La Madonna! Madre de Christo! Yo estoy lista!
JERRY Good shave today..
ELAINE Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.
JERRY I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little..
ELAINE Can we rest here a second.
JERRY Yeah, I guess.
JERRY .. So how's Noreen?
ELAINE Mm! She's got a new boyfriend: Paul.
JERRY Already? That was fast.. I assume he's not a High Talker..
ELAINE No, but, he has, The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya have'ta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.
JERRY A Long Talker.
ELAINE Yeah! But he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone: I just hang up.
JERRY All right; let's move it out.
JERRY Hey, isn't that George's father?
ELAINE Oh, yeah, it is! Should we say hello?
JERRY I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.
ELAINE That man he's with: is he wearing a cape?
JERRY I believe he is wearing a cape.
ELAINE Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?
JERRY Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.
ELAINE Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?
JERRY You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.
JERRY Just, ah, plop it on the counter there.
JERRY Oh! I got a message.
GEORGE Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say..
ELAINE That sounds Urgent..
JERRY Let me call him back.. Hello?? Who is this? Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.
ELAINE Donna Chang?
JERRY Should've talked to her; I love Chinese women.
ELAINE Isn't that a little racist?
JERRY If I like their race, how can that be racist?.. Hellooo??.. Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!.. Yyy-yes, I am calling George.. Oh, the lines are crossed; you're getting his calls. Well, what do you know?!
JERRY So listen..
KRAMER I'm goin' through this stuff like water.. Who you talkin' to?
ELAINE He's on with a Chinese woman.
KRAMER Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women.
ELAINE You got a.. comfort problem there?
KRAMER Yeah, I think these Jockeys shrunk.
ELAINE I thought you wore silk underwear.
KRAMER No. Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stay with it. Yeah, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. My boys need a house.
ELAINE That's nice. Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.
KRAMER Sperm count? Well how many ssssperm should I have?
ELAINE A lot.
JERRY I got a date!
ELAINE With the Chinese woman?!
JERRY She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.
KRAMER Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?
JERRY No, why should I? I wear boxers.
KRAMER You ever get a woman pregnant?
JERRY I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed..
KRAMER What would you say if I told you, "I never impregnated a woman"?
JERRY Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??.. Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women, I--
KRAMER A lot of 'em! Do you think maybe I'm.. Depleted??!!
JERRY Well, I'm sure you're not.. Totally Depleted.
KRAMER Well, but what if I am? I'm the last male Kramer! We're facing extinction!
JERRY Well, go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.
KRAMER Yeah, but then I'd have to.. well, you know.. into a cup? In the middle of the day??
ELAINE Does that conflict with your regular schedule?
ELAINE All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.
JERRY I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!
ELAINE She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?
JERRY She suggested it!
ELAINE I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese..
JERRY She's very assimilated.
JERRY Paul again?
ELAINE You can't get one ring past him.
GEORGE Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!
JERRY I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!
GEORGE Uh?
ELAINE Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.
GEORGE What's he doin' in the city today?
GEORGE You didn't ask him?
GEORGE You didn't say hello?
ELAINE Well, he was with someone. A man.. In a cape.
GEORGE Why was he wearing a cape?..
GEORGE Was my father wearing a cape?
JERRY No. Jacket and tie: no cape.
GEORGE Huh.. Cape.. W--a man with a cape doin' with my father?.. What was my father doing with a man in a cape? .. Why a cape?
DOCTOR The results of your sperm test are in. Well, ummm.. Are you planning to start a family?
KRAMER Yes! I would like to! Very much!.. Well, I'm low, now, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...
DOCTOR Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.
KRAMER Ohhh. Man!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate! I--
DOCTOR Hey--that's not necessarily true. There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.
KRAMER All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.
DOCTOR First thing: you should wear boxer shorts.
KRAMER All the time?
DOCTOR All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.
KRAMER Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.
ELAINE Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling! Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!.. Oh. She's not?! Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'-- Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately.. Oh, okay, well, I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna.. Yeah, I took 20%, too.. Uuum. Look it's uh.. Paul. The.. car.. seems to be running out of gas. .. I'm gonna.. have to get off the phone.
HOSTESS Just let me know when the rest of your party has arrived, sir.
JERRY Yes, I will.
GUY Mind?
JERRY No--go ahead--I second-hand smoke two packs a day.
DONNA Jerry.
JERRY 'scuse me?
DONNA Hi. Sorry I'm late.
JERRY Who're you?
DONNA I'm Donna Chang..
JERRY What do you mean?
DONNA I mean: I'm Donna Chang.
JERRY You're Donna Chang?
DONNA Did you think I was Chinese?..
JERRY Oh. No. Oh, you mean because of the "Chang"?
DONNA Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.
JERRY I didn't think so.
DONNA It used to be "Changstein."
ELAINE She's not Chinese?
JERRY No. Not Chinese. Not even Asian.
ELAINE So. What is she?
JERRY Well, she's.. like you.
ELAINE Oh, how.. disappointed you must have been.
JERRY Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang,"..
ELAINE So why're you seeing her again..
JERRY Well, she is a woman.
ELAINE I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.
JERRY Really?
ELAINE Well, maybe.
JERRY Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?
ELAINE What do you mean?
JERRY Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy.. hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?
KRAMER Here. Take my Jockey shorts.
ELAINE Whoa! Whoa!
JERRY What is that?!!
KRAMER Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.
JERRY Wha--you have a low sperm count?
KRAMER Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em.
JERRY Nnnoo--I don't want 'em.
KRAMER Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!
JERRY Look! I don't want 'em!
KRAMER All it takes is one pair! Now, come on!
JERRY I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!
KRAMER Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flip pin'! I'm floppin'!
KRAMER What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' crazy in these things!
JERRY Well. I'm gonna have to move now.
FRANK Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.
GEORGE Plenty of mosquitoes.
FRANK Queens is full of mosquitoes.
GEORGE So, Dad..
FRANK Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken.
GEORGE Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!
FRANK Your mother has to tell you every move I make!?
GEORGE No.. Jerry and Elaine saw you.
FRANK They didn't say hello?
GEORGE Well, they were in a rush.
FRANK They couldn't just say hello?! .. Oh, to hell with them.
GEORGE They, uh.. said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape, ha ha.
FRANK Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--supercilious.
GEORGE So Dad.
FRANK How could Jerry not say Hello?!!
JERRY So did they, uh, uncross the lines, yet?
DONNA No. They can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.
JERRY --should he say something--can't decide if he should. finally.. Did you say, "ridicurous"?
DONNA Ridiculous.
JERRY I thought you said.. "ridicurous."
JERRY Oh, what are you doing here?
GEORGE Oh, I wanted to, talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you had company. Hi, uh, I'm George.
DONNA Oh! Hi! I'm Donna Chang. I just spoke to your mother before.
GEORGE You spoke to my mother?
DONNA She was trying to call you, but--
JERRY The rines were crossed?
GEORGE Did you say, "The rines were crossed?"
JERRY Did I?
DONNA George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour! Anyway, I'm really sorry.
GEORGE Sorry? Why sorry? What do you have to be sorry for?
DONNA Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.
ELAINE Divorced. That's really too bad..
JERRY Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.
GEORGE Oh my God! You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!
JERRY I never thought of that.
GEORGE Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? Haha! It's like runnin' the double marathon!
ELAINE Hey George, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?
JERRY Have you ever spent any time with these people..?
GEORGE You know what this has to do with? The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this! I don't trust men in capes.
JERRY You can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape. .. Superman wore a cape.. An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.
GEORGE All right Superman's the exception.
ELAINE 
KRAMER Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. I've always had a thing for Noreen.
ELAINE Oh, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.
KRAMER Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope.
JERRY Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers..
KRAMER Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.
JERRY You went back to the Jockeys?
KRAMER Wrong again.
JERRY Oh, no.
ELAINE What? What?..
JERRY Don't you see what's goin' on here??? .. No boxers, no Jockeys..
ELAINE Eeaawww...
JERRY The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine..
JERRY Kramer, say it isn't so.
KRAMER Oh, it be so. I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllovin' every minute of it!!!
JERRY Don't you need a little.. help?
KRAMER Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered.. I'm like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!!
ELAINE Well, you guys are tryin' to work it out! That's great!..
NOREEN Yeah, well.. We're trying.. He just went insane there for a while..
ELAINE Oh, he went insane?..
NOREEN Believe it or not: Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a Sick Person calls and hangs up over and over?
ELAINE Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna, talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making, boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!
NOREEN I can't believe that was you..
ELAINE I'm really sorry, Noreen..
NOREEN So you thought he was boring?
ELAINE Hey! Noreen! Don't go by me! Ha ha.
NOREEN 
JERRY What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!
ELAINE I know--
JERRY First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.
ELAINE Well, Jer--I got confused, they sound exactly the same.
JERRY So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets: A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world: He's Boring.
ELAINE I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.
JERRY Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman! Anything you say she does!
JERRY Yeah.
DONNA It's Donna Chang.
JERRY Come on up.
ELAINE Well, I guess I just didn't realize it..
JERRY Well, let's look back on your history with this woman. Okay?
ELAINE Okay..
JERRY First, you encouraged her to join: The Army. .. She did.
ELAINE She was lost..
JERRY Then: you suggest she goes.. AWOL! She did!
ELAINE Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun..
JERRY You know.. You better make sure you never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge..
ELAINE If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!
DONNA Hi.
JERRY Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine..
DONNA Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.
JERRY Why? What happened?
DONNA Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour, she changed her mind!!!
JERRY Wow! That's amazing!
DONNA Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner! She said you should come too.
JERRY Tonight?
DONNA Yeah--I just remembered: I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class.
GEORGE All right. Let me just say one thing: there is no way that this is goin' to happen. No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your minds!!!
ESTELLE We're not getting divorced.
FRANK You mother changed her mind..
GEORGE Ya-De! That's Goood! That's Very good! I'm very glad to hear that.
FRANK Yeah. We worked it out.
GEORGE All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?
FRANK He was my lawyer.
GEORGE You lawyer wears a cape..?
FRANK Yeah. So what?
GEORGE Who wears a cape?
FRANK He's very independent; doesn't follow the trends.
ESTELLE He looks ridiculous in that thing..
FRANK You have no eye for fashion!!!
ESTELLE I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!
GEORGE All right! Come on! Let's not fight.
FRANK_AND_ESTELLE All right! All right!
ESTELLE Georgie's right.
GEORGE So what made you change your mind?
ESTELLE It was that Chinese woman.
JERRY So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?
DONNA I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.
JERRY Confucius, huh?
DONNA Yeah.
JERRY You know, you're not Chinese...
JERRY Hey! I heard the good news!
FRANK Jerry: how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!
JERRY Elaine was.. in a rush.
FRANK I knew it was Elaine!!
DONNA You must be Estelle.
ESTELLE Yes. Who are you..?
DONNA I'm Donna Chang!
ESTELLE You're not Chinese!
KRAMER Hello?
ELAINE Paul?
KRAMER Elaine!
ELAINE Kramer?
KRAMER Yeahh!
ELAINE What're you doin' there?
KRAMER Wellll, isn't it obvious?
ELAINE Uh! Ah, is Noreen there?
KRAMER Yes, she is..
ELAINE Well? Can I talk to her?
KRAMER What? Am I, tooo.. boring for you?
ELAINE Fine--would you just put her on?
KRAMER Well, I feel it'd be best if you just didn't talk to her for a while..
ELAINE You feel?
KRAMER That's right! She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life lo these many years..
ELAINE What are you insane?!
KRAMER From now, on, I'll be calling the shots around here..
ELAINE Oh! Haha. An' what're you gonna tell her?
KRAMER Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army.. There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now.. And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do..
ELAINE Uh! Kramer! You have got to let me talk to her!
KRAMER Can't help ya, kid.
ESTELLE You're not Chinese!?!?
DONNA No.
ESTELLE I thought you were Chinese!!
DONNA I'm from Long Island.
ESTELLE Long Island?!?! I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!
DONNA I'm sorry..?
ESTELLE Well! Then, that changes everything!
GEORGE What?!
ESTELLE She's not Chinese; I was duped!!
GEORGE So what?! She gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chi nese?!?!
ESTELLE I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!!
GEORGE Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!
FRANK You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!
JERRY You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name..
ELAINE So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!
JERRY Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese.
ELAINE You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.
JERRY Yeah, no one's reading any rolled-up messages in a knish..
GEORGE Oh, it had to happen!! I knew it!!
JERRY Hey.
GEORGE I predicted it! Saw both of them today! What a disaster! I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had, Lunch, with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this!
KRAMER Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live on! Noreen's late! She's laaate!!
NOREEN Who are you?!
MAN I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer.
JERRY Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best. "Oh, is he good?" "Oh, he's the best. This guy's the best." They can't all be the best. There can't be this many bests. Someone's graduating at the bottom of these classes, where are these doctors? Is somewhere, someone saying to their friend, "You should see my doctor, he's the worst. Oh yeah, he's the worst, he's the absolute worst there is. Whatever you've got, it'll be worse after you see him. He's just, he's a butcher. The man's a butcher."? And then there's always that, "Make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me." Why? What's the difference? He's a doctor. What is it, "Oh, you know Bob! Okay, I'll give you the real medicine. Everybody else, I'm giving Tic-Tacs."
JULIANNA ...and usually for lunch I'll have a salad, and for dinner, I eat whatever I want.
JERRY What do you think the worst part of being blind is?
JULIANNA Excuse me?
JERRY You know, if you were blind what do you think the worst part of it would be?
JULIANNA I don't know.
JERRY I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food. How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? I'd constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue.
JULIANNA Well that's how my five-year old eats. He's a very picky eater.
JERRY You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania?
JULIANNA No.
JERRY He was at a carnival with his mother. She goes to get a hot dog, next thing you know she turns around, boom, he's gone.
JULIANNA Oh.
JERRY Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that. And these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, I could be one of these people.
JULIANNA Have you seen any good movies?
JERRY Who takes care of your boy during the day?
JULIANNA We have a woman. Why?
JERRY No no. I'm just saying.
JULIANNA She had references.
JERRY I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. I'm talking about the ones that forge them. You know I think this is really helping.
JULIANNA I don't live near here, ya know!
JERRY So she's giving me the massage and I'm just making conversation.
ELAINE I don't like to talk during a massage.
JERRY Neither do I, but I do it for them. I figure they're bored.
GEORGE Yeah, I do that too. I feel guilty about getting the pleasure. I feel like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying it. There's nothing to eat in here.
ELAINE Oh! I forgot to tell you--
JERRY I'm in the middle of a story.
ELAINE Okay, go ahead.
GEORGE Why don't you ever go shopping?
JERRY Not like it's a really funny story or anything.
ELAINE What happened?
JERRY Well so she mentioned that she had a son, and the for some reason I launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted.
ELAINE Oh, wasn't that terrible?
JERRY Yes, it was.
GEORGE Not even an apple.
ELAINE She doesn't want to hear that, that was stupid.
JERRY I know it was stupid.
ELAINE Really stupid.
JERRY Hey, I just said it was stupid.
GEORGE What about this leftover Chinese food?
JERRY Take it.
ELAINE I can't believe you said that.
JERRY Hey, would you stop it already?
ELAINE So, what did she say?
JERRY I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid.
GEORGE This is terrible. What is this, ginger? I hate ginger. I can't understand how anyone can eat ginger.
ELAINE I have a good masseuse you could go to.
JERRY Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, it's a real medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by insurance.
GEORGE Physical therapy is covered by insurance?
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE You don't have to pay for the massage?
JERRY Not if you have a doctor's note.
ELAINE So where do you get this note?
JERRY Well I've never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist.
GEORGE Right, your friend Roy.
ELAINE What's the name of this physical therapist?
JERRY I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid, she a little off.
GEORGE And you don't have to pay.
GEORGE We have three-o'clock appointments.
RECEPTIONIST George and Elaine, right? Could you fill these out for me please? And Elaine, you'll be seeing Julianna, and George, you'll be with Raymond.
GEORGE Excuse me, did you say 'Raymond'?
RECEPTIONIST Yes.
GEORGE But, uh, Raymond is a man.
RECEPTIONIST That's right.
GEORGE I can't get a massage from a man.
ELAINE Why not?
GEORGE What, are you crazy? I can't have a man touching me. Switch with me.
ELAINE No, I don't want the man either.
GEORGE What's the difference, you're a woman. They're supposed to be touching you.
ELAINE He'd just be touching your back.
GEORGE He'd just be touching your back too.
ELAINE No, it could get sexual.
GEORGE I know. That's the point. If it's gonna get sexual, it should get sexual with you.
ELAINE I wouldn't be comfortable.
GEORGE I would? What if something happens?
ELAINE What could happen?
GEORGE What if it felt good?
ELAINE It's supposed to feel good.
GEORGE I don't want it to feel good.
ELAINE Then why get the massage?
GEORGE Exactly!
RAYMOND George?
GEORGE Yes?
RAYMOND I'm Raymond.
GEORGE Hello.
RAYMOND Are you ready?
RAYMOND ...And then Julianna asked me if I wanted to join her here in the office.
GEORGE Really.
RAYMOND I used to be a flight attendant.
GEORGE Oh boy.
RAYMOND Ya know, why don't you open those pants, it's gonna be a lot easier that way.
RAYMOND So what do you do?
GEORGE What?
RAYMOND I said, 'What do you do?'.
GEORGE I don't know.
RAYMOND You don't know what you do?
GEORGE Nah.
RAYMOND Oh, come on. Hey, you're very tense.
GEORGE Coffee. Too much coffee.
RAYMOND Okay, just take off those pants now, I'll work the hamstring.
GEORGE Oh, the hamstring's fine.
RAYMOND But you wrote that it was tender.
GEORGE I wrote. Pfft, I wrote.
RAYMOND I'll check it out.
GEORGE Are you sure?
RAYMOND Yeah, take 'em off.
RAYMOND How did you hurt this?
GEORGE I don't know.
RAYMOND You don't know?
GEORGE No.
RAYMOND But you just told me--
GEORGE Korea.
RAYMOND You hurt it in Korea?
GEORGE What?
RAYMOND The hamstring.
GEORGE Korea.
RAYMOND How?
GEORGE Hamstring.
RAYMOND How did you hurt the hamstring?
GEORGE Hotel.
ELAINE How'd it go? George?
JERRY No appointments at all? Because my neck is still tight. What about Thursday? And Friday? Oh boy. Okay, thanks anyway.
JERRY What's with you?
GEORGE a...
JERRY Yes, a...?
GEORGE A man gave me...
JERRY Yes, a man gave you...?
GEORGE A man gave me... a massage.
JERRY So?
GEORGE So he... had his hands and, uh, he was...
JERRY He was what?!
GEORGE He was... touching and rubbing.
JERRY That's a massage.
GEORGE And then I took my pants off.
JERRY You took your pants off?
GEORGE For my hamstring.
JERRY Oh.
GEORGE He got about two inches from... there.
JERRY Really?
GEORGE I think it moved.
JERRY Moved?
GEORGE It may have moved, I don't know.
JERRY I'm sure it didn't move.
GEORGE It moved! It was imperceptible but I felt it.
JERRY Maybe it just wanted to change positions? You know, shift to the other side.
GEORGE No, no. It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, this was a move.
JERRY Okay, so what if it moved?
GEORGE That's the sign! The test; if a man makes it move.
JERRY That's not the test. Contact is the test, if it moves as a result of contact.
GEORGE You think it's contact? It has to be touched?
JERRY That's what a gym teacher once told me. Kramer enters.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts. You know, I looked in there and there he was having coffee and a donut.
JERRY Joe DiMaggio? In Dinky Donuts?
KRAMER Yeah. Joe DiMaggio.
JERRY I'm sorry, if Joe DiMaggio wants a donut he goes to a fancy restaurant or a hotel. He's not sitting in Dinky Donuts.
KRAMER Well maybe he likes Dinky Donuts.
GEORGE I don't even like to sit next to a man on an airplane 'cause our knees might touch.
JERRY I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy smelly Dinky Donuts.
KRAMER Why can't Joe DiMaggio have a donut like everyone else?
JERRY He can have a donut, but not at Dinky.
GEORGE I don't even like to use urinals, I've always been a stall man.
KRAMER Look I'm telling-- I'm telling you, that was Joe DiMaggio.
GEORGE The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe, he's in Dinky Donuts. What about this doctor's note? Let's go see your friend Roy.
JERRY I never said I'd do that.
GEORGE What are you talking about, that's seventy-five bucks! I'm not working, I can't afford that.
JERRY I don't know how I feel about it.
GEORGE Oh, what are you, like, a Quaker now?
JERRY Alright, alright.
KRAMER A stall man, huh?
JERRY ...so we were just kinda wondering if it was possible for you to write us a note, and if you can't, believe me, it's fine.
GEORGE He didn't say he can't.
JERRY I mean, if you feel funny about it at all.
GEORGE He doesn't feel funny.
JERRY If he does.
GEORGE Do you feel funny? He didn't say anything.
JERRY He feels funny. You don't have to do this.
GEORGE He knows that!
JERRY Roy, should we go? Is this a breach of our friendship?
GEORGE Oh, can you be any more dramatic?
ROY Don't be ridiculous. Holyfield. He's a good friend of one of my patients. He's got a hell of a body, doesn't he?
GEORGE How would I know?
ROY Do you like him?
GEORGE What do you mean, like him?
ROY Do you like him?
GEORGE I mean he's a good fighter and a nice guy but I don't like him.
ROY How come you don't like him?
GEORGE Why should I?
JERRY What is the matter with you?
GEORGE Nothing, why? You think something's wrong? Am I different?
ROY So, you want the notes?
JERRY You don't have to, really.
ROY Nah nah, it's ok.
JERRY We should probably get one for Elaine, too, right George? George?
JERRY Well what about the week after? No appointments at all? Can I at least just talk to her so I can apologize? Forget it. I can't believe this, I make one innocent comment about some lunatic in Pennsylvania and I'm cut off. This woman is insane. What's with you?
ELAINE What?
JERRY Well you were too close to me, I was all scrunched in there.
ELAINE Hey, you scrunched me. I sat down here first.
KRAMER Hey, I saw DiMaggio in the donut shop again.
JERRY Uh huh.
ELAINE Joe DiMaggio?
KRAMER Joe DiMaggio, you know this time I went in and sat down across from him and I really watched him. I studied his every move. For example, he dunks.
ELAINE Joe DiMaggio dunks his donut?
KRAMER That's right.
JERRY See, now I know it's not him. Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.
KRAMER Oh, he's a dunker.
ELAINE Why couldn't he be a dunker?
KRAMER And nothing diverts his attention. Like, I'm uh, you know, like I'm sitting in there, you know. And I start banging on the table, you know, to uh, look up, you know, Like I'm sitting there you know and uh, bang You know, bang He wouldn't move. So then I start doing these yelping noises. Like, yip yip. No reaction because the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything that's going on around him. See, that's how he played baseball. He dunks like he hits.
ELAINE So then what?
KRAMER Well, then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or they're gonna throw me out.
ELAINE Why didn't you just call out his name?
JERRY What happened to you?
GEORGE One of those kids called me a Mary.
ELAINE A what?
GEORGE I was jumping over a puddle and for some reason I went like this. They called me a Mary. So I chased them, and I tripped and I fell.
KRAMER Yeah, you know kids, they can be very perceptive.
ELAINE Hey, George? What is this? What is that? No really, what is that?
JERRY Hello? Oh, hi Roy. What? Oh my god, how did this happen? What can I do? Oh. I am so sorry. Okay. Bye. That was Roy. He's under investigation for insurance fraud.
KRAMER ...just a man and not a freak, Joltin' Joe DiMaggio. Joe, Joe. Go, Joe...
JERRY I told you.
GEORGE Told me what?
JERRY I told you we shouldn't do it.
GEORGE He didn't say anything.
JERRY He's got a house, a family, they could take away his license. You should have heard him. Three notes, how stupid was that? We never should have got three notes.
ELAINE Three notes?
JERRY Yeah, you, me and George.
ELAINE You got me a note?
JERRY Yeah.
ELAINE But I got my own note.
JERRY You what?
ELAINE I got a note from my gynecologist.
JERRY Why'd you do that?
ELAINE I didn't know you were getting me a note.
JERRY Of course I was getting you a note.
ELAINE But you didn't say anything.
JERRY Neither did you, that's how he got caught. We sent in four notes from two doctors.
KRAMER How can you do that to your friend? He's got a wife, kids, and a lot of other stuff. Oh, yeah.
JERRY Hi Pam.
PAM Hello.
GEORGE Hello.
JERRY I just thought maybe I could talk to Roy.
ROY Pam, did the x-ray from Mrs. Sloan... Hi.
JERRY Hi Roy.
GEORGE How ya doing?
ROY Come on back, I have a patient but she's under.
JERRY I don't even know what to say.
GEORGE Me neither.
JERRY I knew this would happen.
GEORGE Me too.
JERRY I mean the whole thing, it's just...
GEORGE Tragic.
JERRY Well it's not tragic.
GEORGE No?
JERRY No, it's...
GEORGE Unsettling?
JERRY Okay. I mean, what if the--
PAM I hope you're both happy.
JERRY I'm not happy.
GEORGE Me neither. I've never been happy.
JERRY I mean I'm happy sometimes, but not now.
GEORGE In college, maybe. Those were fun times.
JERRY Yeah, college was fun.
PAM You know the whole practice is in jeopardy, you know that?
ROY Don't mind her.
JERRY Oh please, I love her.
GEORGE I've just met her but I'm very impressed.
ROY I can't understand, I've never had a problem with these notes before.
JERRY What's the next move, what's gonna happen now?
ROY Well, nothing really, as long as we get the physical therapist to go along with our story.
JERRY What? The physical therapist? Why?
ROY She just has to say the complaint was related to a dental problem.
GEORGE How ya doing?
JERRY Hi. Look, I know I don't have an appointment but it's really important that I talk with Julianna.
RECEPTIONIST I'm sorry, Mr. Seinfeld, she's not it.
JERRY Yeah, I know she's mad at me but I really have to speak with her.
RECEPTIONIST I told you, she's not here.
JERRY You don't understand.
RECEPTIONIST Look, you have to leave.
JERRY Wait a second, don't you-- Hi. Hi. Look, I don't know what you--
JULIANNA Please!
JERRY --but, you see, let me just talk to you for a second, see, what I did is inadvertently sent an insurance--
JULIANNA I treated you, so please, just get out of the office!
JERRY Can't you just listen to me?
JULIANNA Run Billy! Run to the office and close the door! Call the police!
JERRY The police?
RAYMOND Hi George.
GEORGE Hello.
JERRY Raymond?
ELAINE Well, I mean it's only six months probation, it's a slap on the wrist.
JERRY Yeah, I still don't see any dinner invitations forthcoming.
GEORGE Men have been popping into my sexual fantasies. All of a sudden, I'll be in the middle.
ELAINE Of what? Oh.
GEORGE And a guy will appear from out of nowhere. I say "Get out of here! What do you want? You don't belong here!"
ELAINE What do they do?
GEORGE They talk back. They go, "Hey George, how's it going?" I say, "Get the hell out of here!"
JERRY Hey, it's the K-man. Maybe it's time you got as different hobby.
KRAMER I just came from Roy's. I threw up from the gas.
JERRY Did he say anything?
KRAMER No no, he's fine.
JERRY Oh my god, it's...
GEORGE Joe DiMaggio.
KRAMER Where?
JERRY Having a cup of coffee.
ELAINE He's dunking!
JERRY Wow. Look at him. The Yankee Clipper. Here.
GEORGE You see? Now that is a handsome man. Oh please.
KRAMER Wait, wait. bang bang yip yip See? I told you.
JERRY What causes homophobia? What is it that makes a heterosexual man worry? I think it's because men know that deep down we have weak sales resistance. We're constantly buying shoes that hurt us, pants that don't fit right. Men think, "Obviously I can be talked into anything. What if I accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store, thinking it's a shoe store, and the salesman goes, 'Just hold this guy's hand, walk around the store a little bit, see how you feel. No obligation, no pressure, just try it. Would you like to see him in a sandal?'"
JERRY Well, I painted my apartment again. I've been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it kinda gets me down. I look around, and I think, well, it's a little bit smaller now. You know, I realize it's just the thickness of the paint, but I'm aware of it. It keeps coming in and coming in. Everytime I paint it, it's closer and closer. I don't even know where the wall outlets are anymore. I just look for like a lump with two slots in it. Kinda looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side. That's where I plug in.. My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the Starship Enterprise. You know what I mean? Big chair, nice screen, remote control.. that's why Star Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. Just hurling through space in your living room, watching TV. That's why all the aliens were always dropping in, because Kirk was the only one that had a big screen. They came over Friday night, Klingon boxing.. gotta be there.
JERRY What did you do?
KRAMER Mousse. I moussed up.
ELAINE I guess it was just a matter of time.
KRAMER You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel like I had two lives. My pre-mousse and now, I begin my post-mousse. Hey, tell me the truth, have you ever seen a better looking guy?
JERRY Oh, look, its so subjective.
ELAINE I don't mean to interrupt or anything, but on Sunday, my friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon.
KRAMER Oh, I keep forgetting to enter that.
ELAINE She lives right above First Avenue, and says she has a perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends.
JERRY Maybe.
HAROLD No, I'm not going up there.
JERRY Harold and Manny.
HAROLD I'm not going.
JERRY Boys, boys.
HAROLD Oh, Jerry.
JERRY I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?
HAROLD Yeah, yeah.. Hey, Jerry, would you like anything from Mrs. Hudwalker's apartment? I was only joking. He thinks I'm going to give you Mrs. Hudwalker's things. We have to go up there now and clean the apartment. It's a good thing her rent was overdue. She'd be rotting up there for a month.
JERRY She died? ..Mrs. Hudwalker died?
HAROLD Ninety-four years old. I found her yesterday. She didn't have a wig on. It was horrifying.
MANNY Harold, Come on, hurry up!
HAROLD What's the matter with you?! I'm talking. So, Jerry, you know anyone who needs an apartment?
JERRY Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?
HAROLD Oh yeah, I like her. She always says "hello" to me.
JERRY It's not promised to anybody? 'Cause she would take it in a second.
HAROLD Well, Manny wanted it for his brother, but he got deported. What's the difference? It's true.
JERRY So, it's okay? I could just tell her she can have it?
HAROLD Sure, sure. She's getting a bargain, too. It's only four hundred dollars a month. Okay.. Okay.
KRAMER Hey, Harold, what do you think?
HAROLD Manny, look, Kramer put mousse in his hair.
MANNY It looks worse.
KRAMER Thanks.
ELAINE What was that all about?
JERRY Oh, nothing important.
ELAINE What's going on? What is that look?
JERRY What look? Nothing.
ELAINE Something's going on here.
JERRY I don't know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down.. I can't decide.
ELAINE Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? C'mon. Cough it up.
JERRY Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am - rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure, it hurts sometimes - to give, and give, and give..
ELAINE Would you please?
JERRY What would you say if I told you that..
ELAINE Told me what?!
JERRY ..I got you an apartment in this building.
ELAINE No.
JERRY Yes.
ELAINE No.
JERRY Yes.
ELAINE You didn't.
JERRY I did.
ELAINE You got me an apartment in the building?!
JERRY I got you an apartment in the building.
ELAINE How did you..
JERRY Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? The ninety-four-year-old woman who lived above me?
ELAINE No.
JERRY She died.
ELAINE She died?!
JERRY She died.
ELAINE She died!
JERRY And the rent's only four hundred dollars a month!
ELAINE Get out! Four hundred a month? Only four hundred a month?!
JERRY Four hundred a month.
ELAINE And I'll be right upstairs?
JERRY Right upstairs.
ELAINE Right above you?
JERRY Right above me.
ELAINE Oh, we're neighbors. I'll be here all the time!
JERRY All the time..
ELAINE We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh, this is going to be great!
JERRY ..All the time..
JERRY The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like you're always making a movie. You mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. You know what I mean? Think of the things you wish you could take back. You're out somewhere with people, "Gee, you look pregnant.. are ya?" "Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, that's not gonna work at all. Walk out the door, and come back in. Let's take this whole scene again. People, think about what you're saying!"
GEORGE Thanks, see ya later, Donna. What happened to you?
JERRY You can't believe what I just did.
GEORGE What? What did you do?
JERRY I could tell you what I did, but you wouldn't believe it. It's not believable.
GEORGE What did you do?
JERRY How could I have done that?
GEORGE Done what?
JERRY I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. She's going to move in.
GEORGE Elaine's moving into your building?
JERRY Yes. Right above me.
GEORGE Right above you?
JERRY Yes.
GEORGE You're gonna be neighbors.
JERRY I know. Neighbors.
GEORGE She's right above you?
JERRY Right above me.
GEORGE How could you do that?
JERRY 'Cause I'm an idiot! You may think you're an idiot, but with all due respect - I'm a much bigger idiot than you are.
GEORGE Don't insult me, my friend. Remember who you're talking to. No one's a bigger idiot than me.
JERRY Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?
GEORGE Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Poconos?
JERRY She's right in my building! Right above me! Every time I come in the building, I'm gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar.
GEORGE You're doomed. You're gonna have to have all your sex at women's apartments. It'll be like a permanent road trip. Forget about the home bed advantage.
JERRY But I need the home bed advantage!
GEORGE Of course, we all do.
JERRY Come in for two minutes and sit with me.
GEORGE I was just in there. It's embarrassing.
JERRY Oh, who's gonna know?
GEORGE They saw me walk out.
JERRY Two minutes.
JERRY My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you don't make a mistake? He went for a cup of coffee, and in that second - ruined my life.
GEORGE My censor quit two years ago. He checked into a clinic. Emotionally exhausted.
JERRY ..So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing?
GEORGE Tough.
JERRY You know, the water pressure's terrible in my building.. and she loves a good shower.
GEORGE I don't think anyone's turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray.
JERRY If they were fanatic about showers, they might.
GEORGE For that rent, she'd take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to..
JERRY Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. Isn't that child abuse?
GEORGE I'd like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date first.. remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?
JERRY Yeah, the guy with the flat head?
GEORGE He's a cube.. anyway, he got married six months ago. he told me ever since he's been wearing a wedding band, women have been coming on to him everywhere he goes.
JERRY Yeah, I've heard that about wedding bands.
GEORGE I wonder if that's really true.
JERRY That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You know, Kramer has his father's band. He'd loan it to you.
GEORGE Thanks a lot. I"ll give it back to you in a week.
KRAMER You know, I don't even know why you're fooling around with this ring. I've been telling you, get yourself some plugs, or a piece.
GEORGE I'm not doing that.
KRAMER Oh, man. You know, you're crazy. You're a good looking guy. What do you want to walk around like that for?
GEORGE No, I'll put half a can of mousse in my head like you.
HAROLD I told you I don't like these sponges, they're too small! I want a big sponge! You can't pick up anything with these! There's no absorption!
JERRY Boys, boys.
HAROLD Hi, Jerry.
HAROLD Hello, Jerry.
HAROLD Okay.. your friend can't have the apartment, Jerry.
JERRY What?
HAROLD Because somebody offered Manny five thousand dollars for the apartment. I don't want to do it. Manny wants to do it. Because it's true! Why shouldn't I tell him?
JERRY Hey, hey. I understand. You're businessmen.
HAROLD Oh, now, he says that if your friend has five thousand dollars, we'll give it to her.
JERRY Well, that's a lot of money. But, if that's the way it's gotta be, that's the way it's gotta be. You know, I used to think that the universe is a random, chaotic, sequence of meaningless events, but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things.
GEORGE What happened to you?
JERRY Religion, my friend, that's what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that it's going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs.
GEORGE Five thousand dollars? She doesn't have five thousand dollars!
JERRY Of course she doesn't have five thousand dollars!
GEORGE So, she can't get the apartment.
JERRY Can't get it.
GEORGE So, she doesn't move in.
JERRY No move. So, you see, it's all part of a divine plan.
GEORGE And how does the baldness fit into that plan?
JERRY Elaine?
ELAINE Yeah.
JERRY Alright, this is going to require some great acting now. I have to pretend I'm disappointed. You're going to really see me being a phony, now. I hope you can take this.. maybe you should go in the other room.
GEORGE Are you kidding?! I lie ever second of the day. My whole life is a sham!
JERRY 'Cause you know, I love Elaine.
GEORGE Of course you do.
JERRY But you know.. not in the building. Really, I feel terrible about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? Tell me.. No, I'll be seeing you. "Good morning, good morning.." Have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt it's great to be alive? That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above? Oh, and before I forget, I have the checks for first month, last month, security deposit. I have seventy-five dollars left in my account.
JERRY Well.. there's a little bit of a problem.
ELAINE Oh, I know. There's a weak shower spray, I know. I've already thought about it, and I'm switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, "Why stand when you can sit?" Maybe I'll get some rubber duckies..
JERRY No, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. I'm sure they'd just as soon give it to you, but you'd have to come up with that money.
ELAINE Five thousand dollars? I don't have five thousand dollars.
JERRY I know.
ELAINE How am I going to get five thousand dollars?
JERRY I have no idea.
KRAMER Hey, my new neighbor!
ELAINE I'm not moving in.
KRAMER What?
ELAINE They want five thousand dollars now.
KRAMER So, okay. What's the problem?
ELAINE I don't have five thousand dollars.
KRAMER C'mon, you can come up with five thousand dollars.. Jerry, you don't have five thousand dollars you can led her? Come on.
JERRY Yeah, well, I didn't.. Is that something you want to borrow?
ELAINE No, that's too much money to borrow.
KRAMER Loan her the money. You can afford it.
JERRY She doesn't want to borrow the money.
KRAMER Oh, c'mon. She'll pay you back. What's five grand between friends?
ELAINE Of course I'd pay you back..
KRAMER Yeah, so what's the problem?
JERRY Who said there's a problem?
KRAMER He said he'd loan you the money.
ELAINE Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?
KRAMER That's okay. He doesn't care.
ELAINE You know, money can sometimes come between friends.
KRAMER Get outta here.
ELAINE Let me think about it.
KRAMER What's to think about?
ELAINE I don't know.. I don't know. Five thousand.. let me just take one more look at it.
JERRY It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand.. Where's she gonna get five thousand? She doesn't have five thousand. Clean. Good bye. She's gone. Then you come in, "Why don't you loan her five thousand? What do you care? You've got five thousand. Give her five thousand."
KRAMER You didn't want her in the building?
JERRY No, I didn't!
KRAMER Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for? Oh, look, maybe she won't take it.. I mean, she did say that she was going to think about it.
JERRY People don't turn down money! It's what separates us from the animals.
KRAMER I still don't understand what the problem is having her in the building.
JERRY Let me explain something to you.. You see, you're not normal. You're a great guy, I love you, but you're a pod. I, on the other hand, am a human being. I sometimes feel awkward, uncomfortable, even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings. You wouldn't understand.
KRAMER Because I'm a pod?
ELAINE I'll take it!
ROXANNE Hi, Elaine..
ELAINE Oh, hi, Roxanne. Nice to be here. These are my friends. This is George, and this is Jerry. Jerry's the one who got me my new apartment!
ROXANNE So, you're Elaine's hero.
JERRY Yeah, it's my life's work.
ROXANNE There are so few true heros left in this world.
GEORGE Yeah, my wife couldn't make it today. She's got some thing with her mother.. Who know's what going on with her. Don't let any one kid you, it's tough.
JERRY Well, better load up on some carbos before the race.
ROXANNE Oh, the marathon is great, isn't it?
JERRY Oh, yes. Particularily if your not in it.
ROXANNE I wish we had a view of the finish line.
JERRY What's to see? A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya, and twenty thousand losers.
GEORGE ..Yeah, my wife started getting on me about the lawn today. I'm tellin' ya, it's one thing after another.
RITA Is she here?
GEORGE No, she's working.
RITA What does she do?
GEORGE She's an.. entymologist - you know, bees, flies, gnats. What about you?
RITA I work for the Director of Madison Square Garden. It's great! I can get free tickets to any sporting even in New York. Anyway, she's a very luck woman.
GEORGE But..
ROXANNE Hi Stan. Joanne.
ELAINE Jerry, this is Joanne, and this is Stan. They're in my short story class with Roxanne and me. Hey, Jerry just got me a great apartment in his building!
JOANNE Well, Jerry, it'll be nice having a close friend nearby?
JERRY Fantastic..
STAN She can pop in whenever she wants.
JERRY I know.
JOANNE She doesn't even need to knock!
JERRY It's tremendous.
STAN Anytime of day.
JERRY I'm in heaven.
ELAINE Oh, Rita come here. This is Jerry. He's the one who got me the apartment.
RITA Oh, Hi. bob, this is the guy who got Elaine the apartment.
GEORGE I'm sorry, I don't see the big deal about being a matador. The bull charges, you move the cape, wha't so hard?
SUSIE So, are you really married? Because, I've actually heard of single guys who wear wedding bands to attrack women.
GEORGE You'd have to be a real loser to try something like that.
SUSIE That's too bad, because I really have a thing for bald guys with glasses.
RITA Hey everybody! Here come the runners!
ELAINE So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?
JERRY Oh, I wouldn't quite say that.
ELAINE Really? From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to her.
JERRY I'm a guy.. it always looks like that.
ELAINE Because, I was thinking.. are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, y'kno.. cramp our styles?
JERRY Na..
ELAINE Because, I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us come home with somebody, it could get a little uncomfortable. But - as long as you're okay with it, it's fine with me.
JANICE I've never been able to be with just one person. I can, however, carry on strictly physical relationships which can last for years and years. It's a shame you're married..
GEORGE I'm not. It's just a sociological experiment!
JANICE Please..
JERRY You have no idea what an idiot it. Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didn't take it. This is an idiot.
GEORGE Is that right? I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison Square Garden. So please, a little respect. For I am Costanza. Lord of the Idiots!
ROXANNE You're all winners!
GEORGE But suddenly, a new contender has emerged..
JERRY George, I didn't sleep at all last night.. I decided I have to tell her.. I'm just going to be honest. That's all.. Yes, I'm nervous.. Are you listening to me? Just put some soap on your finger.. it'll slide right off.. Then try axle grease. I'll call you back after I talk to her. Bye.
KRAMER Well, it's all taken care of. Everything's cool.
JERRY What? What's cool?
KRAMER Elaine.
JERRY What are you talking about?
KRAMER I just found a guy who's willing to pay ten thousand dollars for the apartment.
JERRY You what?! Get out! Ten thousand?
KRAMER Cash.
JERRY Who would pay that much?
KRAMER He's in the music business.
JERRY Elaine would never borrow that much money! Kramer, my God, man! This is beautiful! I think I'm in the clear here. Elaine's not moving in! I don't have to confront her! She has no idea I never wanted her to move in.. I"m golden!
KRAMER Well, occasionally, I like to help the humans.
ELAINE Wow. You're right. That is loud.
JERRY It's just unbelievable.
ELAINE They rehearse all the time?
JERRY All the time. I've been up there six times. They refuse to stop. I can't live like this. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I'm heading for breakdown! Can't you do something?
HAROLD I'm not going up. It stinks up there.
JERRY Manny..
MANNY They're allowed to play until eleven o' clock.
HAROLD I'm not the one who said eleven o' clock. He makes up his own rules.
ELAINE Boy, too bad. If I was up there, you'd never hear a peep out of me. I'm as quiet as a mouse.
KRAMER Oh, I love the one they do right after this one!
JERRY I don't know. What do you do when a neighbor is making, like, a lot of noise at three o' clock in the morning? I mean, can you knock on someone's door and tell them to keep it down? You're really altering your whole self-image, I mean, what am I? Fred Mertz now? What's happening to me? Can I do this? Am I a shusher? I used to be a shushee. There's a lot of shushing going on in movie theaters. People are always shushing. Shh..shh.... shhh... shhh.. Doesn't work, 'cause nobody knows where a shush is coming from. They just hear a Shh. "Was that a shush? I think somebody just shushed me." Some people you can't shush in a movie theater. There's always that certain group of people, isn't it. They're talking and talking, and everyone around them is shushing them, and shushing them. They won't shush. They're the unshushables.
JERRY Why were you making gravel?
KRAMER Well ... I like the sound it makes when you walk on it. Hey, those look familiar.
JERRY Of course. It's garbage.
KRAMER No, no, no, no. These brown things. The chairs. Jerry, this is the set from the old Merv Griffin Show! They must be throwing it out. This stuff belongs in the Smithsonian!
JERRY Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian.
KRAMER Look at this. Boy, one minute Elliot Gold is sitting on you and the next thing - you're yesterday's trash.
JERRY Come on, Kramer, get out of there.
KRAMER No, no, no. You go on ahead. I'm not finished taking this in. Oh, Jerry look ... Merv Griffin's cigar.
JERRY 
GEORGE You know I uh, spilled a yohgurt smoothie in here two days ago. Can't smell anything, can y'a?
MIRANDA Banana?
GEORGE Right.
MIRANDA George watch out for those pigeons.
GEORGE Oh they'll get out of the way. You really smell banana?
MIRANDA Oh my God. Oh.
GEORGE So uh where are we eating?
JERRY And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate.
CELIA You're making this up. There was never a Joseph Garnish.
JERRY Wow!
CELIA Oh yeah the toys.
JERRY Where did you get all these?
CELIA My dad was a collector. I inherited them after he died from a long and painful bout ...
JERRY Super bowl! Hey, an original G. I. Joe. With a full frogman suit.
CELIA Jerry, what are you doing?
JERRY I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink.
CELIA No Jerry. They're priceless. They've never been played with.
JERRY I just want to touch them a little.
CELIA I said no. Now come here.
LOU Hi I'm Lou Filerman. I'm new here.
ELAINE Hey Walter what is the deal with that guy?
WALTER Oh he's Lou Filerman. He's new here. Hey your coffee stain looks like Fidel Castro.
ELAINE You've been an enormous help.
JERRY You ran over some pigeons? How many?
GEORGE What ever they had. Miranda thinks I'm a butcher but it's not my fault is it? Don't we have a deal with the pigeons?
JERRY Of course. We have a deal. They get out of the way of our cars, we look the other way on the statue defecation.
GEORGE Right! And these pigeons broke the deal. I will not accept the blame for this.
JERRY So Maranda's cooled on y'a?
GEORGE I'm getting nothing.
JERRY Yeah, me neither.
GEORGE Really? I thought you and Celia were sleeping together?
JERRY Oh, the sex is wild but she's got this incredible toy collection and she won't let me near it!
GEORGE I don't understand women.
JERRY Here comes one.
ELAINE Hey. What's going on?
GEORGE Hey Art Garfunkle?
ELAINE No, Castro.
GEORGE Right.
ELAINE All because of this creepy new guy at work. He just - he just comes out of nowhere and he's right next to you!
JERRY So he just sidles up?
ELAINE That's right! He's a real sidler.
JERRY Maybe you didn't see him.
ELAINE You never see him. He sidled me again in my office. I was sitting there making a cup of soup singing that song from "The Lion King".
JERRY Hakuna Matata?
ELAINE I thought I was alone.
JERRY That doesn't make it right.
JERRY See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup ...
ELAINE Would you just let it go?
KRAMER Hey, Jerry! Come in here a sec! Hey!
JERRY Oh my God!
KRAMER It's the Merv Griffin set
JERRY How did you get this in here?
KRAMER Oh, you just bring it in sideways and hook it.
JERRY So where are you gonna sleep?
KRAMER Yeah ... backstage.
ELAINE Phew! This chair smells like garbage.
KRAMER Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's - they were not as hygienic as they appeared on
TV yeah, you can take Mannix for example.
JERRY I'm gonna get that.
KRAMER All right. Well, Jerry, we'd love to have you back anytime Well, Elaine Benes! Well, it's great to have you! Why, is it possible that you are even more beautiful than the last time I saw you?
ELAINE 
GEORGE We had a deal!
ELAINE Mr. Peterman, here are these pages that you wanted.
PETERMAN One moment. I'm reading the most fascinating article on the most fascinating people of the year. Annnnnd done. Oh, yes. I'm sorry I needed this so quickly. It must have been an awful lot of work. Thank you very much, you two.
ELAINE What?
JERRY So three dates and she still won't let me play with her toys.
KRAMER That's interesting. You know someone mentioned to me you were not very happy with your toys growing up.
JERRY Yeah, that was me.
KRAMER Oh, that's right, right, right. And uh you mentioned that uh, you didn't get a G.I. Joe. You had.
JERRY An Army Pete.
KRAMER Right.
JERRY He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and then split.
KRAMER And we all know how painful that can be.
ELAINE Jerry
KRAMER Oh, Elaine Benes. Well, this is quite a thrill, yes. Come on sit down. Yes.
ELAINE Well, I'll tell ya, this sidler guy is really chapping my hide.
KRAMER Excuse me yeah. We're talking ... this way.
ELAINE Well, he's getting credit for work I did! He's gonna sidle me right out of a job.
KRAMER Now, for those of us who don't know, uh, sidling is what?
ELAINE Kramer, what is wrong with you?
KRAMER What do you mean?
ELAINE Well, for starters, you're looking at note cards I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste of his own medicine, so, I'm going to sidle the sidler.
JERRY You, sidle? You ... you stomp around like a Clydesdale!
ELAINE Not with these honeys. ... Wrestling shoes!
KRAMER Only in New York. ... ha ha
GEORGE Jerry?
KRAMER Oh! Well, ladies and gentlemen! It's our good friend, George Costanza! What a surprise! Yeah, sit, sit, sit.. Weeell!
GEORGE Well, it happened again.
JERRY What happened?
KRAMER tut tut , I'll ask the questions. What happened?
GEORGE Well, I just stomped some pigeons in the park. They - they didn't move.
KRAMER All right, let's change the subject. Now, uh you and Jerry dated for a while. Tell us ... what was that like? That was the wrong card.
GEORGE I I don't get these birds! They're breaking the deal. It's like the pigeons decided to ignore me!
JERRY So they're like everyone else.
KRAMER All right, let's take a short break. .... Okay! We're back!
GEORGE Boy that bank clock is eight minutes off.
MIRANDA Then why don't you just run IT over too?
GEORGE Zing.
MIRANDA George, what are you doing?
GEORGE Did you see that? That-that pigeon didn't move! I had to swerve to get out of the way! I saved that pigeons life!
MIRANDA What pigeon? You drove right onto that squirrel.
GEORGE Squirrel? Well, we have no deal with THEM!
CELIA Jerry! Those hands! They never stop!
JERRY I'm sorry. You got any booze? Let's say you and I get ripped!
CELIA No thanks. I have a headache. Can you just get me an aspirin?
JERRY All right.
LOU Here's the new copy you wanted.
PETERMAN Ah, yes. Well this certainly looks like a lot of words. In record time. I'm very impressed ... with both of you.
ELAINE Thank you. ha ha
PETERMAN Unfortunately, I am also disgusted. This is incoherent dribble! This is a total redo and I'm assuming I need it right away.
ELAINE Well, I guess we'll just Hey, just gimme that.
JERRY Mission accomplished! Back to base, Joe.
MIRANDA Doctor, is the squirrel going to live?
DOCTOR There's been massive trauma. We could of course try to save him but it would be costly, difficult and we'd have to send away for some special really tiny instruments.
GEORGE Well, uh, are there any other options?
DOCTOR We could put him to sleep.
GEORGE What might that cost?
DOCTOR Well, it's by the pound. So ... about 80 cents.
GEORGE Well? I was just - I'm curious, that's all. We, uh. we'd like you to do everything possible.
DOCTOR He, um. he's not going to be the same, you know?
GEORGE yeah. yeah. I know.
GEORGE So they're flying the tiny instruments in from El Paso.
KRAMER El Paso? I spent a month there one night.
NEWMAN El Paso!
JERRY What's he here for?
KRAMER To take some of the pressure off of me. So, Jerry, what's going on with you? I understand there's a young lady in your life. mmm
JERRY Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has this amazing toy collection and last night I finally got to play with them.
KRAMER Well. It sounds like things are progressing. Do I hear wedding bells?
NEWMAN Are you married right now?
JERRY Actually she doesn't even know about the toys. I gave her the wrong kind of medicine and I guess she passed out!
KRAMER What do you mean "wrong kind of medicine"?
JERRY She's even got that old Matel football game that we love!
GEORGE Oh, come on! You gotta get me over there!
KRAMER Wait a minute, wait a minute! You mean to say that you drugged a woman so you could take advantage of her toys? Let's pause a moment. Jerry, now, what you do with your personal life is your business, but when you're on my set - you clean it up, mister!
NEWMAN I told you he was a risk.
JERRY Oh, like he's not just carrying you! And has been for years!
NEWMAN Yeah? Well, you bombed! That story stunk worse than these chairs!
KRAMER Smile, everyone! We're back!
LOU You wanted to see me, Elaine?
ELAINE Yes, Lou. you've got a lot going for you. You're, ... um ... you're spontaneous. You're symmetrical. You're, uh, ... you're very quick, aren't y'a?. It's just that your...
LOU My dead tooth?
ELAINE No. Your.
LOU My breath?
ELAINE Eechh.
LOU What can I do?
ELAINE Well, you should never ever go anywhere without these.
LOU Thanks, Elaine. You're such a super lady!
GEORGE More wine and turkey?
JERRY So when I saw George on the street with an 18 pound turkey and a giant box of wine, I thought: ... What a coincidence. We're just about to eat.
CELIA What is that stuff in turkey that makes you sleepy?
JERRY_AND_GEORGE Triptaphen.
JERRY ... I think. Have some more wine.
CELIA What video did you get?
JERRY Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan.
GEORGE Four hours.
JERRY More heavy gravy?
GEORGE Yes! Touch down! Your turn, Jerry.
NEWMAN Lately, though, I've been, uh, - I've been buying the generic brand of waxed beans. you know. I rip of the label. I can hardly tell the difference.
KRAMER Well, we've officially bottomed out. Who's our next guest?
NEWMAN We've got no one!
KRAMER We need a new foreman. We should shut down and re-tool.
NEWMAN What about a guest-host?
KRAMER I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
MIRANDA Doctor, how's the squirrel?
GEORGE Is he dead?
DOCTOR No. Fortunately, the special tiny instruments arrived just in time. Would you like to visit him?
MIRANDA Yes he would.
DOCTOR You have 30 minutes.
GOERGE So ... uh, squirrel.
DOCTOR One more thing Mister Costanza, we just need to know what time you'll be picking him up tomorrow.
GEORGE What's that?
DOCTOR Oh, we're discharging the squirrel. We think he'll be better off at home.
GEORGE He has no home. He's a squirrel.
DOCTOR Your home, Mister Costanza. Just make sure he gets his medicine six times a day and keep his tail elevated.
JERRY Maybe it'll be fun having a pet.
GEORGE It's not a pet! It's a wild invalid! And it knows that I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better, it's gonna gnaw my brain out in my sleep!
KRAMER Jerry, what are you doin' tomorrow? I want you to come by the set.
JERRY What about my "questionable material"?
KRAMER Nope, we got a whole new format. Edgy, youthful, plus ... we got Jim Fowler!
JERRY Jim Fowler? The animal guy from "Wild Kingdom" is coming to your apartment?
KRAMER Well, I practically raised his kids.
GEORGE That's perfect! He's a zoo guy! He take's care of animals. Can I bring the squirrel by?
KRAMER What? Two animal acts on the same show? What is this, amateur hour? Look, George, I'm sorry, but maybe another time, all right?
GEORGE I gotta get to Fowler. I know that he would take this squirrel off my hands. It's practically bionic!
ELAINE Hey! ha ha Nice sidle, huh? Speaking of which I think I got that problem solved.
JERRY Tic-Tacs worked?
ELAINE He's a human maraca.
GEORGE Boy, my knuckles are still cramped from that football game.
ELAINE You took him over to Celia's?
JERRY What? It's a victimless crime.
ELAINE What about the woman who's been drugged and taken advantage of?
JERRY Okay, one victim.
ELAINE I think it's unconscionable.
GEORGE Hey, last night, I found a whole Weeble Village right behind the EZ Bake oven.
ELAINE EZ Bake oven?
ELAINE Who wants cupcake?
GEORGE Oh, me, me, me, me, me!
JERRY You know, that batter is, like, 30 years old.
FRANK You step on it and it flushes.
ELAINE Why is your father giving a tour of a rest stop?
ESTELLE Stop squirming.
GEORGE Oh, don't look. This is the part where they change me.
JERRY You're like eight years old.
ESTELLE Georgie.
GEORGE I was seven and a half.
PETERMAN That noise. that's the noise.
ELAINE What?
PETERMAN That inferno rattling sound that has plagued me these past two days - and I could not find the source. In my office, in the hallway. even in the men's room! Shame on you, Elaine!
ELAINE No, no, Mr. Peterman that wasn't me!
PETERMAN That reminds me of the Hatian Voodoo rattle torture! You haven't gone over to their side have you?
ELAINE No Mister Peterman.
PETERMAN Because, if I hear one more rattle - just one - your out on your can And if you are undead - I'll find out about that too.
ELAINE Lou! In here! We have to talk.
LOU Oh, right.
ELAINE No, stop it! Bad voodoo. You gotta stop using these.
LOU Why?
ELAINE Because they're turning your teeth green?
LOU I only buy the white ones.
ELAINE Okay ... well then your teeth are green for a different reason. Just stop carrying these, okay? Just ... just mouth wash.
LOU I can't. It burns my cankers.
ELAINE Binacca?
LOU Again.
ELAINE Right, right, cankers. Um, I got it! Chew gum!
LOU I hate gum. The only guy I ever liked came with the Mickey Mouse gumball machine. They stopped making that about 20 years ago.
ELAINE Well, stinky, this is your lucky day.
KRAMER Okay. a little later, we're gonna be talking with animal expert Jim Fowler.
FOWLER Where are the cameras?
KRAMER But first, we're talking with Jerry. Okay, Jerry, uh, you drugged a woman in order to play with her toy collection. How do you feel about that?
JERRY It was great! I've done it a few more time since then.
KRAMER And she doesn't know anything about this?
JERRY No, not a thing.
NEWMAN laughs
KRAMER Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on out, Celia!
CELIA What kind of a sick twisted creep are you?
NEWMAN_AND_KRAMER Woah.
JERRY What is this? What is she doing here?
KRAMER It's the new format. Scandals and Animals. Go with it.
CELIA If you think you can drug me and play with my toys, you got another thing coming, buddy!
NEWMAN Go girl!
JERRY Well, what kind of woman drinks a whole box of wine?
NEWMAN_AND_KRAMER Ohhh!
GEORGE Mister Fowler, I have a squirrel here that is a miracle of modern science!
KRAMER George I told you we're booked!
FOWLER Careful. Hawks and squirrels don't get along together.
KRAMER Ohhh. another interesting confrontation. This could be spicy. Yeah, George bring him over.
FOWLER No, you idiot! Hawks eat squirrels!
KRAMER Are we getting this?
JERRY So the whole set was destroyed?
KRAMER Well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing.
GEORGE Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work ... sorry about the set.
KRAMER I tell y'a it was a grind trying to fill 10 hours a week. I'm not sure I was ready to have my own talk show set.
MIRANDA I got the nut bread, George. Let's go.
JERRY So the squirrel's gonna make it?
GEORGE Yeah, he's in my bed. I'm sleeping on the couch.
JERRY Sleeping on the couch? So you're...
GEORGE Still getting nothing! So go ahead pigeons. Laugh it up. I'm getting in my car now and the last think I heard ... we have NO DEAL!
CELIA I'm glad you called, Elaine. I really needed to talk to someone.
ELAINE Oh well, hey, I dated Jerry too. I know what a monster he can be. More wine and turkey?
CELIA Who's he?
ELAINE Oh, he's nobody. Hey, listen, ... let me top that off for y'a.
STAN ...And so the baby's head comes out, and I'm screaming and my brother who's been videotaping the whole thing turns green, his eyes roll up in his head and he blacks out, drops the camera, the camera breaks, then , the placenta comes flying out.
ELAINE Whoa.
STAN And then doctor says...
JERRY Thank you, that's enough.
STAN Will you look at that baby. Sucking like there's no tomorrow. Just sucking away. Suck, suck, suck...
JERRY Yeah, yeah, yeah.
STAN Look at that Jerry, look at that. Sucking, sucking...
JERRY Yeah, I looked. I saw.
STAN This doesn't make you uncomfortable, does it?
JERRY Uncomfortable? Not at all. See your friend's wife's breast sticking out - why would that make me uncomfortable?
STAN Look at him.
JERRY How long do they do that?
STAN Oh, a year or two.
JERRY No break?
STAN Then comes the weaning.
JERRY So after the sucking, comes the weaning.
ELAINE First the sucking then the weaning.
JERRY Well, you gotta wean.
STAN Gotta wean.
ELAINE It's a must wean situation.
GEORGE What about that spot I got?
JERRY Yeah, that's a great spot.
GEORGE You open the door to the car, boom, you walk right into the hospital. You can't beat that spot. I'm on a roll. I am just willing these great parking spots. In front of my house. In front of Jerry's building. Did I tell you about the spot in front of the post office?
JERRY Yes.
GEORGE I'm driving to the post office.
JERRY 
GEORGE Maybe the baby would like to see my spot. A positive, uplifting message to start his life out with. You can still get a great space in this town - if you apply yourself.
JERRY Where's Kramer? He should've been here by now.
ELAINE Did you give him the room number?
JERRY Yes, 1397.
KRAMER 1937, 1937, 1937...
PATIENT Excuse me. Do you know where the staircase is?
KRAMER Uh.. over there... 1937.
KRAMER Pig man! It's a pig man! Pig man!
STAN ..So anyway, Jerry and Elaine, we have something we want to ask you.
GEORGE Look at it. I pulled it in perfectly equidistant from the car in front of me and the car behind me.
JERRY Will you shut up.
ELAINE I'm taking a cab home. I can't take it anymore.
JERRY So what were you about to say, Stan?
STAN Myra and I would like you and Elaine to be the Godparents of Steven.
ELAINE Wow.
JERRY Me? A godfather?
STAN Yes.
JERRY Never go against the family, Elaine.
ELAINE What?
KRAMER The pig-man! I saw a pig-man! He was just lying there and then he woke up. He looked up at me and made this horrible sound
GEORGE Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?
KRAMER I'm talking about the pigman, George. I went into the wrong room and there he was.
GEORGE A pigman?
KRAMER Yes, a pigman. Half pig, half man.
ELAINE That's nice, Kramer... So, anyway, what exactly is involved in being a Godparent?
JERRY Elaine, don't ever ask me about my business!.... "Godfather."
MYRA Nothing really.
STAN The most important thing is to help with the bris.
JERRY The bris?
ELAINE The bris?
KRAMER A bris? you mean snip snip?
STAN Yeah.
KRAMER I would advise against that.
ELAINE Kramer. It's a tradition.
KRAMER Well, so was sacrificing virgins to appease the gods, but we don't do that anymore.
JERRY Well, maybe we should.
GEORGE Why are all those people milling around my car?
KRAMER I don't know.
JERRY Maybe they're admiring your spot.
KRAMER No. They're all looking up. GEORGE. Oh my god, there's somebody on the roof of the hospital.
KRAMER Whoa. That's the guy who asked me where the staircase was.
GEORGE Jeez, I hope he doesn't.. Oh no! My car! My car!
ELAINE A mohel! What the hell is a mohel?
JERRY A mohel is the person who performs the circumcision.
ELAINE Where am I going to find a Mohel? How do you find a mohel? Motels, models..
JERRY Oh, finding a Mohel is a piece of cake. Any idiot can find a Mohel. I have the tough job. I have to hold the baby while they do it. How would you like that job?
ELAINE Have you ever seen one?
JERRY You mean that wasn't -
ELAINE Yeah.
JERRY No.. you?
ELAINE Ya.
JERRY What'd you think?
ELAINE No...
JERRY Not good?
ELAINE No, had no face, no personality, very dull. It was like a martian. But hey, that's me.
JERRY Hey.
GEORGE Well I just got the estimate. It's going to cost more to fix that roof than the car's worth, So I'm gonna go see the hospital administrator today. Someone's paying for that damage and it's not gonna be me.
JERRY Ah, you're screwed.
GEORGE I know, swan dives from twenty floors, lands right on to it. What do I have a bulls eye on there? He couldn't move over two feet? Land on the sidewalk. That's city property. What are the chances, what are the odds? He couldn't do it again if his life depended on it...
ELAINE Well I have to interview a Mohel.
JERRY Oh, poor Elaine. Look at her. Attended the finest finishing schools on the Eastern seaboard. Equestrian competitions. Debutante balls. Well, look at you now. Interviewing Mohels.
JERRY What's the matter?
ELAINE Are you alright?
KRAMER Don't even question my instincts, because my instincts are honed. Look at that.
JERRY What now? "Hospital receives grant to conduct DNA research".." Government funds genetic research at area hospital" ... Yeah, so?
KRAMER Pigman, baby. Pigman.
ELAINE Oh, if I hear about this pigman one more time...
KRAMER I'm tellin ya the pigman is alive. The governments been experimenting with pigmen since the fifties.
JERRY Will you stop it. Just because a hospital gets a grant to study DNA doesn't mean they are creating a race of mutant pigmen.
KRAMER Oh. Jerry wake up to reality. It's military thing. They're probably creating a whole army of pig warriors.
GEORGE I wish there were pigmen. You get a few of these pigmen walking around I'm looking a whole lot better. Then if somebody wants to fix me up at least they could say, "Hey he's no pig-man!"
JERRY Believe me, there'd be plenty of women going for the pig-men. No matter what the deformity you'll find some group of perverts attracted to it. "Oo that little tail turns me on."
ELAINE Alright, that's about enough
JERRY Oh, what's the matter you're not interested in this?
ELAINE No, it's fascinating, could you do me a favor, could you tape the rest of the pigmen and the women who love them discussion and I'll listen to it next time I'm here. I've got to find a Mohel.
KRAMER You should call this off, Elaine. It's a barbaric ritual.
ELAINE Perhaps one day when the pigmen roam free it will be stopped. Until then, off with their heads.
GEORGE But Kramer, isn't it a question of hygiene?
KRAMER Oh, that's a myth. Besides, you know, it makes sex more pleasurable.
GEORGE Yeah. So how does that help me?
JERRY Hey George, have you ever seen one?
GEORGE Yeah, my roommate in college.
JERRY So what'd you think?
GEORGE I got used to it.
JERRY Alright, I'm waiting. I want to see the pig-man. Show me the pig- man.
KRAMER Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna show him to you, and you'll never be the same.
JERRY Maybe he's just a guy with a nose like this. You know a lot of people have a nose like this, they're not necessarily pig-men.
KRAMER Believe me, Jerry, somewhere in this hospital the anguished oink of pigman cries for help.
JERRY If I hear an anguished oink, I'm outta here.
KRAMER I can't let this go on.
JERRY Let me understand this. So if you find the pigman, your intention is to ...emancipate him?
KRAMER That's right. Sue-wee!
JERRY Kramer! well I don't see any pig-men. Look Human, human, human... Wait a minute!... Oh, that's George.
GEORGE Okay. The administrator's on the third floor. I'll meet you guys by the car.
KRAMER You got room for the pig-man?
GEORGE The pig-man can take the bus.
KRAMER You know, if pig-man had a car, he'd give you a ride.
GEORGE How do you know? What if Pigman had a two-seater?
KRAMER Come on George, be realistic.
GEORGE All right, if pig-man comes along, we'll squeeze him in. I'll see you later.
MRS._SWEEDLER Mr. Costanza, come in, come in. It's been a very trying couple of days around the hospital. Patients, doctors, everyone, just grief stricken over this unfortunate occurrence.
GEORGE Well, I join them in their grief. Mrs. Sweedler Horrible, just a horrible thing. Flew right past the children's wing. All the sick children, in the playroom, looking out the window, just traumatize by the incident. Apparently, they all thought he was flying. You know how children are, "Oh look. A man is flying. A man is flying" And then, splat...
GEORGE Yes, splat. Exactly. Splat. That's where I come in. On splat. You see, Mrs. Sweedler, or is it hospital administrator Sweedler? Mrs. Sweedler Mrs. Sweedler's fine.
GEORGE You see, that trudge affected me in a very, very personal way.
MRS._SWEEDLER How is that?
GEORGE Yes, you see, the deceased landed on my car. The splat, as it were, actually took place on the roof of my car. I can't help but think that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy may have been averted but I've never been the type to buy a convertible, what with the baldness and all.
MRS._SWEEDLER Well I've known bald men who owned convertibles. They wore a hat.
GEORGE Well then it's all pulled down. Anyway. The damage, unfortunately, has marred an otherwise fine automobile, rendering it virtually undriveable.
MRS._SWEEDLER Yes, well, that is a shame.
GEORGE Yes, a shame. That's just how I would describe it. Now, with all due sensitivity and discretion, bearing in mind the scope of the situation, I can't help but think the hospital bears some responsibility to compensate the other, still living "victim", of this horrendous, horrendous tragedy.
MRS._SWEEDLER Mr.Constanza.
GEORGE Yes.
MRS._SWEEDLER A man plummeted tragically to his ultimate demise -
GEORGE Yes.
MRS._SWEEDLER ... and you greedily, callously try to profit from it.
GEORGE Well, profit. I think you'll see from the estimates that I'm not really profiting that much. They might be a little high, but..
MRS._SWEEDLER How dare you.
GEORGE What?
MRS._SWEEDLER Have you no decency? Have you no shame?
GEORGE Yes.. you know, depending.
MRS._SWEEDLER Get out! Get out, now! get out of my office.
GEORGE Should I leave these with you?
MRS._SWEEDLER Get out!
KRAMER Excuse me. What happened to the man, that was in this room before?
RESIDENT I don't know what you're talking about.
KRAMER You know. .
RESIDENT No.
KRAMER This doesn't look familiar to you?
RESIDENT Sir?
KRAMER Look, I know what's going on. Oink, oink.
RESIDENT I really have some patients I have to attend to.
KRAMER Look, you little quack, I know you had a half man half pig holed up in that room, there. Now where is he?! Where is he?!
RESIDENT Half-what?
KRAMER You know what - bacon, sausage, A-deek-a-deek-a- deek th-th-th-that's all folks.
RESIDENT Oh, the pig-man. They moved him down the hall.
JERRY Alright Kramer, enough of this. Let's go find George.
KRAMER You go ahead.
JERRY Where's the Mohel?
ELAINE He'll be here.
JERRY He's late already.
ELAINE Relax. You'd think you were getting whacked.
JERRY How did I get to be Godfather? I don't even know him that well. Just cause we're on the softball team and I'm the pitcher and he's the catcher he thinks we have a relationship?
ELAINE I thought pitchers and catchers did have a special rapport.
JERRY Maybe in hardball it's more involved you know they have signals and everything. I'm just lobbing it in. We don't have conferences. He doesn't come out to the mound and encourage me.
ELAINE What about me? I watched a few games with her sitting in the stands.
JERRY Don't they have any closer friends. They're level jumping on our friendship.
ELAINE yes it is level jumping.
GEORGE So uh... ever been to a bris before?
WOMAN No.
GEORGE If you fell little woozy, and it's quite common, just stay close to me. I'll get you through it.
WOMAN I'm a cardiologist. I think I can manage.
GEORGE Oh.
KRAMER Don't believe them when they tell you it doesn't hurt. It hurts bad. It hurts really bad. Imagine, this will be his first memory. Of someone yanking the hat off his little man. I know you love your baby, but what kind of perverts would stand idly by while a stranger rips the cover off his 9-iron and then serve a catered lunch? She'll be okay.
ELAINE What's wrong with you?
KRAMER Me? What's wrong with you?! How can you let this go on?
ELAINE Hey have you ever seen one of those?
KRAMER No.
ELAINE Well I have and believe me it's no picnic.
KRAMER Oh, how bad could it be?
ELAINE Alright. Has anybody here ever seen one?
MAN One what?
ELAINE ... you know
MAN I have.
WOMAN I have.
ELAINE And?
ALL No...
GEORGE I got used to it.
MOHEL Hello, hello, I'm the mohel. It's very nice to meet you all... Oh! What was that?!? Jeez. Scared the hell out of me. My god. I almost had a heart attack! Alright I'm fine, I'm fine. Anyway, we're here to perform the mitzvah of the bris and... ...Is the baby gonna cry like that? Is that how the baby cries, with the loud, sustained, squealing cry, 'cause that could pose a problem. Do you have any control of your child 'cause this is the time to exercise it when baby is crying in that high-pitched, squealing tone that can drive you insane?!!!
ELAINE Did you find the place alright?
MOHEL Did I find it alright? I mean could you send me to a more dangerous neighborhood? I'm dreading walking back to the subway, someone shouldn't crack me over the head and steal my bag, 'accuse I'll be lying there on the street in this neighborhood and people will spit on me and empty my pockets. I'll lie in the gutter like a bum, like a dog, like a mutt, like an animal! God forbid someone should help me or call an ambulance. No, that's too much trouble to pick up a phone and press a few buttons. Ahh! What's the point.
ELAINE Do you feel alright?
MOHEL Darling, you see where that glass is? How that glass is near the edge of the table. You got the whole table there to put the glass, why you chose the absolute edge, so half the glass is hanging off the table, you breath and that glass falls over, then you're gonna have broken glass on the carpet, embedded in the carpet fibers, deep, deep in the shag, broken glass, bits of broken glass that you never get out. you can't get it out with a vacuum cleaner. Even on your hands and knees with a magnifying glass, you can't get all the pieces, and then you think you got it all and two years later, you're walkin' barefoot and you step on a piece of broken glass and you kill yourself, is that what you want? I don't think you want that, is it? .. Do you?
ELAINE He's very highly recommended.
KRAMER The mohel is twitching.
MOHEL Who's holding the baby? Hello! Who is holding the baby?!? Who is holding the baby?
ELAINE Jerry is...Jerry!
JERRY Yeah.
ELAINE Jerry go over there.
JERRY All right.
ELAINE Go.
JERRY I'm going.
ELAINE c'mon
JERRY Don't push me.
MOHEL Okay. you sit here. Bring out the baby. Bring out the baby. I need the baby!
KRAMER I can't let you do this. KRAMER. I can't let you do this! No! No! I won't!
MOHEL People compose yourselves. This is a bris. We are performing a bris here, not a burlesque show. This is not a school play! This is not a baggy pants farce! This is a bris. An ancient, sacred ceremony, symbolizing the covenant between God and Abraham... or something. Damn. No! Don't touch anything! Don't touch a thing! Away! .. I coulda been a kosher butcher like my brother. The money's good. There's a union, with benefits. And, cows have no families. You make a mistake with a cow, you move on with your life... Anyway.
JERRY Hurry up George! Step on it!
GEORGE Alright, alright!
JERRY That damn Mohel - he circumcised my finger! The mohel circumcised my finger!
ELAINE You flinched.
JERRY Flinched? I did not flinch. George, did I flinch?
ELAINE How should he know He blacked out. He fainted.
GEORGE It was very traumatic. But the last thing I remember is you flinching. Then, everything went black.
JERRY Who's got a tissue? I need more tissues! Look at this thing. It's my phone finger!
GEORGE Be careful, you're bleeding all over the car.
KRAMER What about the baby?
JERRY The baby's fine. They're just taking him to the hospital as a precautionary measure. I'm the one who's hurt. Look at me.
ELAINE Will you stop it? You'll just need a few stitches.
JERRY Stitches? I've never had stitched. I'll be deformed. I can't live with that. It goes against my whole personality. It's not me!
GEORGE Hey look a this - boy are you lucky - another spot - right in front of the hospital. In an emergency yet! How lucky is that? Is that unbelievable? How unbelievable is that?
JERRY I'm getting faint. I'm losing consciousness.
KRAMER You'll be okay. I'll see you later.
GEORGE Where's he going? I'm gonna look for a bathroom.
JERRY Well if it isn't Shakey the Mohel! You did a hell of a circumcision there pal. But it's not supposed to be a finger.
MOHEL It was your fault! You flinched!
JERRY Who made you a mohel? Whadya, get your degree from a matchbook?
MOHEL See! See! He flinched again!
JERRY Good mohel picking, Elaine. You picked a helluva mohel.
MOHEL One more peep out of you and I'll slice you up like a smoked sturgeon.
JERRY Don't threaten me, Butcher Boy.
MOHEL Butcher Boy?!
JERRY What was this? What was this?
MOHEL What was this? It was your fault!
JERRY It was not!
ELAINE Jerry, be careful. The Mohel's got a knife!
STAN Hey, hey stop it, stop it! What's going on here? You two should be ashamed of yourselves.
MOHEL Ah, blood.
ELAINE How's the baby?
STAN The baby's fine. There's nothing wrong with the baby.
MOHEL Thank god the flincher didn't harm the baby. I will get you for this. This is my business, this is my life. No one ruins this for me. No on! Here's my card.
JERRY I can't do this. Look what they did to my boy, They massacred my boy.
ELAINE You really do the worst Godfather I ever heard. You're not even close.
JERRY It's the Flicks.
GEORGE It's a '76 Chevy Impala. It was stolen right in front of the hospital. Yeah, I saw him take off in it. He's about five feet, hairless, pink complexion.. well. he looks like a pig. Yeah, okay, thanks a lot.
GEORGE So any word? Did you hear from the "pigman?"
KRAMER No.
GEORGE And he's not a pigman is he?
KRAMER NO, he's not.. .He's just a fat little mental patient.
JERRY Hi Stan, hi Myra.
MYRA Don't touch him
JERRY What's wrong?
STAN You're out, Jerru. You're out as Godfather. You too, Elaine. You're both out.
ELAINE But
STAN We want Kramer.
KRAMER I'd be honored.
JERRY But I'm the pitcher. You're the catcher. We have a special relationship.
STAN Godfather.
MYRA Godfather.
JERRY The Christmas tree certainly seems to inspire a love/hate relationship. All that time is spent selecting it and decorating it, and then a week after it's just thrown somewhere, you see it by the side of the road, it looks like a mob hit. A car slows down, a door opens and this tree just rolls out. People snap out of that Christmas spirit like it was a drunken stupor, they just wake up one morning and go, "Oh my god, there's a tree inside the house! Just throw it anywhere!
JERRY Ready to go Lois?
LOIS You really like to say my name? Don't you?
JERRY Excuse me Lois. Stand back Lois. Jimmy's in trouble Lois.
LOIS Oh, Mr. Meyers this is my friend, Jerry.
DUNCAN Jerry Seinfeld!
JERRY Duncan Meyers!
LOIS You two know each other?
DUNCAN Yeah! We uh, went to High School together. Didn't we Jerry? Gee I hope you're not leaving now. We still have a lot of work left to do.
LOIS Would you be able to come all the way downtown again in rush hour to pick me up?
JERRY Well, I'd have to be Superman to do that Lois.
ELAINE No, no This is all wrong. Where's the Chicken Cashew?
LEW You no order Chicken Cashew.
ELAINE I didn't order any of this. I'm not paying for this.
LEW Fine Benes. We are putting you on our list.
ELAINE What list?
LEW The "do not deliver" list.
ELAINE Merry Christmas to you! Well, I guess we'll just go out.
GEORGE Yeah. What are you doing with the Daily Worker?
ELAINE Ned must have left it here.
GEORGE Your boyfriend reads the Daily Worker? What is he? A communist?
ELAINE He reads everything, you know, Ned's very well read.
GEORGE Maybe he's just "very well red"?
ELAINE Communist? Don't you think he probably would have told me?
GEORGE Well, does he wear bland, drab, olive colored clothing?
ELAINE Yes, . . . yes he does dress a little drab.
GEORGE Huh, he's a communist. . . . Look at this. "Exciting uninhibited woman seeks forward thinking comrade and appearance not important." . . . Appearance Not Important! This is unbelievable. Finally this is an ideology I can embrace.
JERRY Hi oh.
ELAINE_AND_GEORGE Hey.
ELAINE Where's Lois?
JERRY She couldn't make it.
GEORGE I can't believe you're really going out with a woman named Lois.
JERRY I know, finally. But George, guess who her boss is. Duncan Meyers.
GEORGE Duncan Meyers?
ELAINE Who's he?
JERRY Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about to tell you and that's George. When we were in the ninth grade they had us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see who was going to represent the school in this track meet.
ELAINE Uh uh
JERRY I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym . . .
ELAINE What's that?
JERRY Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym teacher.
ELAINE Oh, of course.
JERRY He was down at the other end. So he yells out, "Ready, On your mark, Get set, " and I was so keyed up I just took off. By the time he said go I was ten yards ahead of everybody.
ELAINE No.
GEORGE I looked up. I couldn't believe it.
JERRY By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody had noticed the head start.
ELAINE Really?
JERRY And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed. Only Duncan suspected something was a miss. He's hated me ever since. Now he's back.
ELAINE Well what happened when you raced him again?
JERRY I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose not to run.
ELAINE So now Duncan is back?
JERRY He's back. And I knew he would be someday. Man that's some tart cider!
LOIS Hi.
JERRY Hi.
LOIS Sorry I missed the Chinese food.
JERRY Oh, so am I . Uh, how's Duncan?
LOIS He's okay.
JERRY He say anything?
LOIS About what?
JERRY Oh, nothing in particular.
LOIS . . . Why did you cheat in that race?
JERRY I did not cheat.
LOIS He said that you got a head start.
JERRY Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second.
LOIS Really?
JERRY Yes
LOIS So you were the fastest kid in school.
JERRY Faster than a speeding bullet Lois.
ELAINE So how was work? Another day, another dollar?
NED I guess.
ELAINE Oh well nothing wrong with that. Gotta make those big bucks. . . . money money money money money money money . . . ha ha ha ha ah . . . are you a communist?
NED Yes, as a matter of fact I am.
ELAINE Oh, Ah! Oh! Wow! Whoa! A Commie! Wow, gee, man it must be a bummer for you guys what with the fall of the soviet empire and everything .
NED Yeah, well, we still got China, and Cuba,
ELAINE Yeah, but come on . . .
NED I know it's not the same.
ELAINE Well, you had a good run, what was it 75, 80 years? Wreaking havoc, making everybody nervous.
NED Yeah, we had a good run.
ELAINE Well, so enjoy yourself. ha ha uh ha
GEORGE So you lied to her?
JERRY I couldn't tell her the truth. I don't know what's going to happen between us. What if we have a bad breakup. She'll go straight to Duncan. And I want him to go to his grave never being certain I got that head start.
ELAINE Well, I'm dating a communist.
JERRY Wow, a communist. That's something.
ELAINE Yeah, that's pretty cool isn't it?
GEORGE Hey, did I tell you I called one of those girls from the personal ads in The Daily Worker?
JERRY The Daily Worker has personal ads?
GEORGE And they say appearance is not important.
ELAINE Yours or hers?
KRAMER Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Merry Christmas everyone. Merry Christmas.
JERRY Wow, look at you. So you got the job.
KRAMER Yeah, you're looking at the new Santa at Coleman's Department store.
ELAINE Oh, congratulations
MICKEY Come on get your bead on. We're going to be late.
KRAMER On Prancer on Dasher, on Donna.
MICKEY Not Donna, it's Donner.
KRAMER Donna!
MICKEY Yeah, right!. On Prancer, on Dancer, on Donna, on Ethyl, on Harriet.
JERRY Hello, Oh hi Lois, you want to get together, what for? I don't know about that, I'll have to think about it. I'll let you know. Okay, bye.
GEORGE What's up?
JERRY Duncan wants to get together with her and me for lunch tomorrow. He obviously wants me to admit I got a head start. And I don't think she believes me.
GEORGE He wants to meet you? I'll tell you what. I'll show up. He doesn't know we're friends. I'll pretend I haven't seen you since High School. I'll back up the story.
JERRY That's not bad.
GEORGE Not bad? It's gorgeous!
KRAMER Ho ho ho Well come on little Princess, tell Santa what you want. Don't be shy.
MOMICKEY She doesn't speak English .
KRAMER Santa speaks the language of all children. A notchie watchie dotchie do.
KRAMER A dotchie cotchie dochie,
KRAMER Het, Mickey when do we get a break? My lap is killing me.
MICKEY There is no break.
KRAMER A sweat shop.
KRAMER Hey, hey, hey.
ADA Natalie on line 2.
GEORGE Natalie?
ADA From the Daily Worker.
GEORGE Thank you.
GEORGE Hello, it's Natalie? Yeah, this is a business office but I'm not a business man per se. I'm here working for the people. Yes, I'm causing dissent. Stirring the pot. Getting people to question the whole rotten system.
ILENE Elaine.
ELAINE Ilene.
ILENE Hi.
ELAINE Hello.
ILENE Doing a little Christmas shopping?
ELAINE Yeah, yeah. Oh, this is Ned. He's a communist.
ILENE Oh, really?
ELAINE Yep . . . a big communist, a big big communist.
ILENE Oh, well, it's awfully nice to see you. See you later.
ELAINE Bye bye
ELAINE Hey, listen while we're here why don't we do a little shirt shopping?
NED Out of the question.
ELAINE Um. Kramer!
KRAMER Hi
ELAINE Hi, oh hi Mickey, this is Ned
KRAMER Oh, hey, hi buddy.
ELAINE You guys stay here, I'll be right back.
KRAMER Eight hours of jingle belling and ho ho hoing. Boy, I am ho'd out.
NED Anyone who works here is a sap.
MICKEY Watch it!
KRAMER Woah, woah, come on.
NED You understand the Santa's at Bloomfields are making double what you are?
KRAMER Double?
NED I bet the beard itches doesn't it?
KRAMER You got that straight.
NED So when you get a rash all over your face in January do you think Coleman's will be there with a medical plan?
MICKEY Look, you take that commie crap out into the street.
NED Kramer, I've got some literature in my car that will change your whole way of thinking.
KRAMER Talk to me baby.
MICKEY Don't listen to him Kramer, you've got a good job here.
DUNCAN But there's no way you could have beaten me by that much. I already beaten you in Junior High School three times.
JERRY I didn't hit puberty til the 9th grade. That's what gave me my speed. Besides, if I got a head start why didn't Mr. Bevilacqua stop the race?
DUNCAN That's what I've always wondered about.
JERRY Well, I . . .
GEORGE Oh, my God, No, oh my God, . . . Jerry!
JERRY I'm sorry, uh,
GEORGE George, George Costanza!
JERRY Oh, George Costanza , Kennedy High.
GEORGE Yes yes yes This is unbelievable.
DUNCAN Hi, George
GEORGE Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, don't tell me, don't tell me. It starts with a . . . Duncan Meyers. Oh, wow, this is something. I haven't seen you guys in what, twenty years?
JERRY This is Lois.
LOIS Hello.
GEORGE So what have you been doing with yourself?
JERRY I'm I'm a comedian.
GEORGE Ah ha, well, I really wouldn't know about that. I don't watch much TV. I like to read. So what do you do, a lot of that "did you ever notice?" this kind of stuff.
JERRY Yeah, yeah
GEORGE It strikes me a lot of guys are doing that kind of humor now.
JERRY Yeah, yeah, Well, you really got bald there, didn't you?
GEORGE Yeah, yeah.
JERRY You really used to have a think full head of hair.
GEORGE Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess I started losing it when I was about twenty-eight right around the time I made my first million. You know what they say. The first million is the hardest one.
JERRY yeah, yeah.
LOIS What do you do?
GEORGE I'm an architect.
LOIS Have you designed any buildings in New York?
GEORGE Have you seen the new addition to the Guggenheim?
LOIS You did that?
GEORGE Yep. And it didn't take very long either.
JERRY Well you've really built yourself up into something.
GEORGE Well, well, I had a dream, Jerry.
JERRY Well, one cannot help
ELAINE . . . shut up!
JERRY And he's calling all these people from High School to come and watch. I knew this day would come. I can't do it. I can't go through with it. I'm calling it off. I can't let the legend die. It's like a kid finding out there's no Santa Claus
KRAMER Each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.
MICKEY What does that mean?
KRAMER Well, if you've got needs and abilities that's a pretty good combination.
MICKEY So what if I want to open up a delicatessen?
KRAMER There are no delicatessens under Communism.
MICKEY Why not?
KRAMER Well, because the meats are divided into a class system. You got Pastrami and Corned Beef in one class and Salami and Bologna in another. That's not right.
MICKEY So you can't get Corned Beef?
KRAMER Well, you know, if you're in the Politburo, maybe.
GEORGE . It's George Costanza. . are there any messages for me? Why does Mr. Steinbrenner want to see me in his office? . . . Communist? I'm not a Communist . . . . All right, all right. All right, I'll be there. - My secretary Ada, told Mr Steinbrenner I'm a Communist Now he wants to see me in his office.
JERRY So you'll just explain to him you're not a Communist. You just called the woman for a date.
JERRY Hello, oh hi Duncan, 4:00 o'clock tomorrow? That is not going to work. . . . Why? I'll tell you why. Because I chose not to run!
NED I'm sorry Elaine. The shirt's too fancy.
ELAINE Just because you're a communist, does that mean you can't wear anything nice? You look like Trotsky. It's gorgeous. Fine, you want to be a Communist, be a Communist. Can't you at least look like a successful Communist?
NED All right, I'll try it on.
ELAINE I'm going to order Chinese Food.
NED You're ordering from Hop Sing's, right?
ELAINE Ugh, does it have to be Hop Sing's. I kind of had a fight with him.
NED Elaine, when my father was black listed he couldn't work for years. He and his friends used to sit at Hop Sing's every day figuring out how to survive.
ELAINE You're father was blacklisted?
NED Yes he was, and you know why? Because he was betrayed by people he trusted. They "named names".
ELAINE Okay, okay. Um, yeah, hi, I'd like delivery please to 16 West 75th St. apartment 2G.
LEW I know that address. You're Benes, right. You're on our list. No more delivery.
ELAINE No. no, she doesn't live here anymore. This is someone else.
LEW Oh, yeah. What's the name?
ELAINE Why do you need the name? You already have the address.
LEW We need a name. Give us a name.
ELAINE Okay, okay, Ned Isakoff.
KID I want a racing car set.
KRAMER Ho ho ho ho A racing car set! Those are assembled in Tai Wan by kids like you. And these Coleman pigs, they sell it at triple the cost.
KID But I want a racing car set.
KRAMER You see kid, you're being bamboozaled. These capatalist fat cats are inflating the profit margin and reducing your total number of toys.
KID Hey, this guy's a Commie!
MICKEY Hey, kid, quiet. Were did a nice little boy like you learn such a bad word like that? Huh?
KID Commie, Commie, Commie
MICKEY Santa is not a Commie. He just forgot how his good friend stuck his neck out for him to get him a good job like this. Didn't he Santa!
STORE_MANAGER Is there a problem here?
KRAMER ho ho ho ho.
KID This guy's a Commie. He's spreading propoganda.
STORE_MANAGER Oh yeah? Well that's enough pinko! You're through. The both of ya'
MICKEY I got two kids in college.
KRAMER You can't fire me, I'm Santa Claus.
STORE_MANAGER Not anymore. Get your skinny ass out of here.
JERRY Hi how are you?
LOIS . . . Fine.
JERRY What's the matter?
LOIS I just spoke to Duncan. He said if you don't race, he's going to fire me.
JERRY What? He can't do that.
LOIS Yes he can. He controls the means of production. What are you going to do Jerry?
JERRY Don't worry Lois. I'll think of something.
LEW Ah, I knew it was you! You tried to trick Hop Sing! You are onour list; Elaine Benes! And now you are on our list; Ned Isakoff.
NED You got me blacklisted from Hop Sing's?
LEW She named name!
GEORGE You, uh, wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?
STEINBRENNER Yes George, I did. Come in, come in. George, the wordaround the office is that you're a Communist.
GEORGE C-Communist? I am a Yankee, sir, first and foremost.
STEINBRENNER You know George, it struck me today me that a Communistpipeline into the vast reservoir of Cuban baseball talent could be thegreatest thing ever to happen to this organization.
GEORGE Sir?
STEINBRENNER You could be invaluable to this franchise. George, there's a southpaw down there nobody's been able to get a look at; something Rodriguez, I don't really know his name. You get yourselfdown to Havana right away.
GEORGE Yes, sir. Yes sir, do my best.
STEINBRENNER Good, Merry Christmas George. And bring me back some of those cigars in the cedar boxes, you know the ones with the fancy rings? I love those fancy rings. They kind of distract you while you're smoking. The red and yellow are nice. It looks good against the brown of the cigar. The Maduro, I like the Maduro wrapper. The darker the better, that's what I say. Of course, the Claro's good too. That's more of a pale brown, almost like a milky coffee. I find the ring size very confusing. They have it in centimeters which I don't really understand that well...
MICKEY That was quick! Nice job, Santa!
KRAMER Yeah,
MICKEY I knew that Commie stuff was going to get us in trouble.
KRAMER Yeah, well I didn't realize that was such a sensitive issue.
MICKEY Communism, You didn't realize Communism was a sensitive issue? What do you think has been going on in the world for the past 60 years? Wake up and smell the coffee.
KRAMER I guess I screwed up!
MICKEY You sure did. Big time.
ELAINE How do you feel?
JERRY I need a miracle.
DUNCAN Now you're going to see what kind of liar you're mixed up with.
LOIS If he beats you I want a big raise.
DUNCAN If he beats me, I'll not only give you a raise, I'll send you to Hawaii for two weeks.
KRAMER I parked in front of that restaurant . As soon as this race is over I got to go to the airport.
GEORGE Okay, all right, all right.
MR._BEVILACQUA You ready boys?
JERRY Yes, Mr. Beviacqua
MR._BEVILACQUA Okay, this is hoiw it works. You take your marks, I say, Ready - On Your Mark - Get Set - and then fire. You got it? DUNCAN AND JERRY: Yes Mr. Bevilacqua.
MR._BEVILACQUA Ready - On Your Mark
LOIS So will you come to Hawaii with me Jerry?
JERRY Maybe I will , Lois. Maybe I will.
GEORGE You wanted to see me, El Presidente?
CASTRO Si, si. Come here. I understand you are very interested in one of our players, eh?
GEORGE Si, si.
CASTRO Ordinarily I would not grant such a request but I've heard you are, uh, how you say, Communista simpatico, eh?
GEORGE Muy sumpatico. Muy muy muy.
CASTRO Well good, then you can have your pick.
GEORGE Oh, oh!
CASTRO They will play for your Yankees.
GEORGE Oh well, gracias El Commandante, gracias. Muy muy.
CASTRO And I would be honored if you would be my guest for dinner tonight at the Presidential palace. There will be girls there and, I hear, some pretty good food. Of course the problem with parties is you invariably have to eat standing up which I don't care for but on the other hand I don't like to balance a plate on my lap either. Once when I was at a party, I put my plate on someone's piano. I assure you, if I had not been a dictator, I would not have been able to get away with that one.
TOM What do you mean made up?
JERRY It's made up. Haagen-Dazs is made up. It's not Danish.
TOM You're crazy.
JERRY No I'm not. George. Is Haagen-Dazs Danish?
MICHAEL What do you mean Danish?
GEORGE This guy stinks.
JERRY Danish. Is it from Denmark?
MICHAEL No, they make it in New Jersey. It's just a Danishy name.
TOM I can't believe that. They fooled me Jerry.
RITA Boy, talk about a show about nothing.
GEORGE Uh, excuse me. Excuse me. This--This is not right. May I? You see, you're going: "They fooled me Jerry!" You wanna hit 'fooled' more: "They fooled me Jerry!". You see the difference?
TOM I'm not gonna say it like that.
GEORGE Just a suggestion.
YELLING_GUY All right everybody, take a five.
GEORGE Yep. That's five!
JERRY George? I don't have a lot of experience with this acting stuff. But from what I can gather, they're a little touchy about being told how to say the lines.
GEORGE Why is that?
JERRY I don't know, but they don't seem to like it. By the way how am I doing?
GEORGE Oh, you're fine... you're fine. So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins?
JERRY Why would he steal a box of raisins?
GEORGE Yeah, it's bizarre.
RITA What's with him? Russell? Russell?
RUSSELL What?
RITA You O.K.?
RUSSELL Yeah. No, uh, I was just thinking of something. I'll be back in a second.
SANDI What's the matter?
JERRY Nothing.
SANDI You're acting weird. Is anything wrong?
JERRY No.
SANDI Are you breaking up with me?
JERRY Are we going out?
SANDI You're breaking up with me, aren't you?
JERRY Do you want me to break up with you?
SANDI If that's what you want.
JERRY I don't even know what you're talking about.
SANDI Fine. Break up with me.
JERRY All right. We're broken up.
SANDI Can we still be friends?
GEORGE Remember when you came to audition for us?
TOM Yeah.
GEORGE There was a box of raisins on the coffee table. Did you, by any chance, take them with you when left?
TOM What are you talking about?
GEORGE Well we were all eating the raisins. And I remember you--you were eating some of the raisins. And then you left, and the raisins were gone. And I was just wondering if, you know , maybe you took them with you.
TOM Are you accusing me of stealing the raisins?
GEORGE Oh, no, no--
TOM Why would I steal a box of raisins!?
GEORGE No you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's just that... they were missing, and... well I'm just inquiring.
TOM Let me give you a word of advice. O.K.? I want you to stay away from me. I don't wanna talk to you, and I don't wanna hear anymore of your stupid little notes and suggestions. I don't like you. So if you got any other problems whether it's raisins, prunes, figs, or any other dried fruit, just keep it to yourself and stay out of my way, O.K.?
GEORGE Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. All right. I don't think we're gonna have any problem with that. Good talking to you Tom. Really.
RUSSELL Elaine. Elaine. What do you want? What can I do? Is it my job? Is that what it is? Elaine I can't go on like this. Will you call me? Would you call me? Well, why? All right. May I call you? Elaine? Elaine?
DAVID Excuse me Mr. Dalrimple. I am so sorry.
RUSSELL All right. All right. What's your name?
DAVID David Richardson.
RUSSELL Get out! You're fired!
DAVID But Mr. Dalrimple--
RUSSELL Don't talk back to me. Didn't you hear what I say? Get out! You want me to call the cops? I make and break little worms like you every day. Do you know how much money I make? Do you have any idea! Do you know where I live? I can have any woman in this city that I want. Any one. Now, GET OUT! What are you all looking at? Go back to work! BACK! NOW!
GEORGE The doc called and said the lab's backed up and now I'm not gonna get the results for another two days.
JERRY Ah! You're fine. There's nothing wrong with you. I'm the one who's dying.
GEORGE What do you mean?
JERRY Because I can't act! I stink! I don't what I'm doing!
GEORGE Come on you're... uh... you're fine.
JERRY This show's gonna ruin my entire career. I don't know how I got involved in this.
GEORGE What about me? I was a total failure. Everything was fine. Now this thing's gonna be a success and God's gonna give me a terminal disease.
JERRY This actress playing Elaine, she's out of her mind.
GEORGE The guy playing Kramer threatened me.
JERRY Why?
GEORGE 'cause I asked him about the raisins.
JERRY You mentioned the raisins.
GEORGE Oh yeah.
JERRY Did he take 'em?
GEORGE I don't know.
JERRY Well if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em?
GEORGE That's what I'm trying to find out.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Any luck?
KRAMER No. No, nothing. I got no... peristalsis.
JERRY What about bran?
JERRY Well my friend, it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus.
KRAMER Pfft! Hold it right there. If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, you're wasting your time. I am not Jerry, under any circumstances, doing any inserting in that area.
JERRY Oh, it's not that bad!
GEORGE Yes it is.
ELAINE Well it's all taken care of. I filed a report. An investigation is underway.
JERRY So, you going to the taping tomorrow night?
ELAINE No. I don't think I should go. I really don't wanna bump into Russell. He called me the other day. He won't quit.
JERRY Oh, come on you gotta go! He's harmless. He's got a little crush on you.
ELAINE Jerry, this is not a crush. This is a complete fixation. he makes me very uncomfortable.
JERRY We need you there!
ELAINE Hey are you gonna go?
KRAMER No. No. I'm gonna stay home. I want to be close to my home base in case there's any news from the front. The taping is about to begin. People are walking into the studio. Jerry is getting a makeup. Michael walks around backstage, he seems nervous and agitated. Rita, Stu and Jay are sitting in the crowd. Russell is missing. George looks at his lip in a mirror. Tom is sitting in his dressing room, eating the raisins. Elaine walks into the studio, wearing and adjusting a blonde short-haired wig, and also wearing bold glsasses. Scene cuts to the drugstore where Kramer is buying the dreaded apparatus. Sandi, sitting next to Jerry who's still getting a makeup, is having her hair done.
SANDI No! Pick it up more in the front! It's got to be higher! Higher! Make a wall! A wall!
ASSISTANT_DRESSER Sandi, are you in wardrobe? Sandi?
JERRY Try Elaine.
ASSISTANT_DRESSER Elaine?
SANDI Yes?
WILTON Elaine? It's me-- Wilton Marshall. Remember? Camp Tioga-- 1978? Remember?
ELAINE Oh, right.
WILTON Wow! You know you haven't changed a bit.
MICHAEL I can't remember my lines!!!
JERRY Just relax, you'll be fine.
MICHAEL I can't relax. I don't know what line! I don't know any of 'em!
JERRY You're just like George. George'd do the same thing. You're just like him. It's amazing!
MICHAEL Help me Jerry! Help me!
RITA Where is Russell?
STU You know I don't know. I thought he was coming. I assumed he wouldn't miss it.
JAY He hasn't been well.
STU Can I tell you something in confidence? I think it's a woman.
RITA How pathetic.
GEORGE This is George Costanza, I'm calling for my test results. Negative? Oh, my God. WHY! WHY! WHY? What? What? Negative is good? Oh, yes of course! How stupid of me. Thank you. Thank you very much.
GEORGE Listen. I know we've had our problems in the past, but we got a show to do tonight. Time to pull together as a team. Life's too short. I say, let's let bygones be bygones. If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins-- They weren't even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems like a strange to do to walk into a room, audition, and to walk out with a box of raisins. Anyway, whatever. If you ever want to tell me about it, the door to my office is always opened. In the event that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins. We'll have a nice laugh.
TOM How would you like it if I just pulled your heart out of your chest right now, and shoved it down your throat?
PAT_HAZELL Are you ready to meet our cast? All right.
JERRY Good evening, folks. How you doing? Well, you sound like a great crowd. We have a show we're gonna put on for you tonight. It's a new TV show. It's what they call a pilot. And we hope it becomes a series. It's called 'Jerry', and I'm playing Jerry--
JOE_DEVOLA sic sempter tyrannis!
GEORGE Sic semper tyrannis? What is that, Latin?
JERRY Yeah, it's what John Wilkes Booth yelled out when he shot Lincoln.
GEORGE Really? What does it mean?
JERRY It means: "Death to tyrants".
GEORGE I can see that.
ELAINE See, now this is exciting! This is exciting! Did I miss anything already?
JERRY No, it starts in five minutes. You were there at the taping, what's the big deal?
ELAINE Nah, now it's on TV. It's different. I told everybody I know to watch it.
GEORGE Yeah, me too.
JERRY Hey, what about Russell? Did you hear from him?
ELAINE No.
JERRY Strange. Even not showing up at the taping...
KRAMER Hey, pistol-packin mama, you swing that gal around, Allemande left with the old gray hag, around and around you go. Yee-ha!!
JERRY Well, well, well.
ELAINE Congratulations.
KRAMER Well, thank you.

KRAMER Oh, yes.
ELAINE Hey, what's this? Look. A wallet.
JERRY A wallet? Let me see that.
ELAINE Here.
JERRY Ah, man! It's my father's wallet! The one he thought they stole at the doctor's office that time.
GEORGE Shh! This is it!
JERRY How do you like that? 
ELAINE Bravo!
GEORGE You hurt me.
MICHAEL Hey.
JERRY Hey George.
MICHAEL New sneakers?
JERRY Yeah.
MICHAEL What do you need new sneakers for?
JERRY I like sneakers.
MICHAEL How do you make a decision which one to wear? I'd go crazy if I have to decide which sneakers to wear every day.
JERRY Nah, you're crazy anyway.
SUSAN_AND_ALLSION George!
SID What kind of stupid show is this? Hey! It's that idiot that took all my records!
MARLA John, what are you doing? Come back to bed.
JOHN This show looks interesting. Isn't he that Seinfeld fellow you went out with?
MARLA Ooh, he's horrible! Horrible!
JOHN Nevertheless...
THE_DRAKE Ah, that Jerry's a funny guy. Huh? Got to love the Sein!
ALLSION Hate the Sein!
PING I can't believe you liked him.
CHERYL I thought he was dark and disturbed.
PING Real perceptive.
DONALD This is a piece of crap!
MOTHER Donald, you used to like him.
DONALD What a sellout! Give me that remote!
MEL No, Donald.
KRAMER Come on Jerry, the commercials almost over.
JERRY All right.

JERRY Oh yeah. He's good. You know he's John Ritter's cousin.
ELAINE Really?
JERRY Yeah.
JERRY Hello, Charles.
CHARLES Hello. So, where do you want me to start today?
JERRY Why don't you start in the bedroom?
CHARLES Start in the bedroom...
TOM Hey.
JERRY Hey. The butler's here.
TOM He is? Listen. When he's finished, send him over to my house.
JERRY I'm not sending him to your house.
TOM Why not?
JERRY Because the judge decreed he'd become my butler, not my friend's butler.
TOM Jerry, he is your butler. You can give him any order you want. That's what butlers do.
JERRY But I don't want to.
KRAMER Jerry, my house is a pigsty, come on.
JERRY Yeah?
SANDI It's Elaine.
JERRY Come on up.
CHARLES I need more Pledge.
JERRY More Pledge! I just bought two cans last week and I don't even have any wood in the house!
CHARLES Well, it goes fast.
SANDI Hello.
CHARLES Hello.
JERRY What's all this about?
SANDI We had a date.
JERRY You had a date? You went out with my butler? Who said you could go out with my butler?
SANDI Why do I need your permission?
JERRY Because he's my butler!
MORTY That's terrific!
HELEN How could anyone not like him? 
CALVIN_KLEIN I like his style. He has a sort of casual elegance.
TIA But he picks his nose. 
CALVIN_KLEIN Nevertheless...
SAL_BASS He's a member of our health club. Isn't he?
SIDRA Yeah...
SAL_BASS You know that Kim Novak has some big breasts?
JERRY Ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves? they all watch
JERRY You know I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you've pretty much mapped out his future, wouldn't you say? Not much chance is gonna be a hitman I think after that. "Terribly sorry Sir, but I'm going to have to whack you".
ALL Wooh! Yeah!
ELAINE Wow! That was great! That show was so funny. It was really funny. I'm not just saying that cause I know you. Honestly.
JERRY Let's go out and celebrate!

JERRY Oh, my God. Did he get fired?
RITA To be honest with you. Nobody really knows. He seems to have disappeared.
JERRY Russell's disappeared?
RITA In any event, I've been made the new president of NBC. As you may or may not know, Russell and I did not see eye to eye on many, many projects. And as my first order of business, I'm, uh, passing on your show.
JERRY You're passing already? But the show just ended two minutes ago!
RITA Well, I just got the job. Goodbye, Jerry.
JERRY Yeah, see ya.
ELAINE What-- What are you looking at me for?
GEORGE It was you!
ELAINE What did I do?
JERRY Do you realize his obsession with you cost us a TV series?
ELAINE I didn't know that he'd fall for me and I'd drive him insane. I mean, you know, that's not my fault.
GEORGE Yes it is! You're very charming!
ELAINE I can't believe this? What happened to him? Where the hell is he?
JERRY No one knows.
RUSSELL She works for Pendant Publishing. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. You know, I used to work for NBC, but when I go back to her this time, she'll respect me.
MAN_ON_RAFT You'd better get down. They might start firing soon.
JERRY Hey look at this. What is going on here?

ELAINE Ask your mother, you live with her now, don't you? Anyway, so then this guy comes up to me and starts feeling my jacket through his thumb and his forefinger like this.
JERRY So, what did you do?
ELAINE I said: "So, what do you think?". And he said, "Gabardine?". And I said, "Yeah." That was it.
GEORGE Wow, just felt your material?
ELAINE Yeah...Jake Jarmel.
GEORGE Sounds like a cool guy.
JERRY Sounds like a jerk. Felt your material, come on.
GEORGE Jerry, where did you get that sweater?
JERRY What do you think? I found it at the back of my closet.

ELAINE Hey, that's Barry. Look it's Barry.
JERRY Hey...
ELAINE Hi.
GEORGE Who's that?
JERRY That's Barry Prophet, he's our accountant.

JERRY You don't think...?
ELAINE Oh, no! Come on Jerry.
GEORGE He was definitely sniffing.

ELAINE Maybe it's the cold weather.
JERRY Today is not cold.
GEORGE All right, I've got to get going. My parents are expecting me.
ELAINE Don't forget to wash your hands before supper.
FRANK Why do you need all that ketchup for?
GEORGE This is my ketchup. I bought this ketchup just so I could have as much as I want.
FRANK So, I talked to Phil Casacof today.
ESTELLE Phil Casacof?
FRANK Yeah, you know my friend, the bra salesman. He says they are looking maybe to put somebody on so I got you an interview next Friday with his boss.
GEORGE Next Friday, what time?
FRANK 2 o'clock.
GEORGE That's my whole afternoon! I was going to look for sneakers.
FRANK You can look for sneakers the next day!
ESTELLE He doesn't know anything about bras.
GEORGE I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know?
FRANK Well, it wouldn't hurt to go in the and be able to discuss it intelligently. Maybe you should take a look at a few bras? Where is you bra? Give him a bra to look.
ESTELLE I am not giving him a bra.
FRANK Why not?
ESTELLE Because I don't need him looking at my bra.
FRANK Why, so he'll go to the interview and he wouldn't know what he's talking about!?!
GEORGE Do we have to...?
FRANK You don't even know what they're made from.
GEORGE They are made from lycra-spandex.
FRANK Get out of here! Lycra-spandex?
ESTELLE I think they are made from lycra-spandex.
FRANK Wanna bet? How much you wanna bet?
ESTELLE I'm not betting!
FRANK Take a look.
ESTELLE All right, I'll get a bra.
FRANK I don't know what the big problem is getting a bra?!
GEORGE She doesn't want to get a bra.
FRANK I'm not saying go to the library and read the whole history, but it wouldn't kill you to know a little bit about it.
GEORGE All right, it wouldn't kill me.
FRANK How long it takes to find a bra? What's going on in there? You ask me to get a pair of underwear, I'm back in two seconds...you know about the cup sizes and all? They have different cups.
GEORGE I-I know about the cups.
FRANK You got the A, B, C the D. That's the biggest.
GEORGE I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on knowing that the D is the biggest.
ESTELLE Here, here's the bra.
FRANK Let me see it.
FRANK Let me see it.
ESTELLE I told you. Here, think you know everything?
FRANK Hmm, that's surprising. All right, what else? You got the cups in the front, two loops in the back. All right, a guess that's about it.
GEORGE I got it. Cups in the front, loops in the back.
ESTELLE You got ketchup on it!
KRAMER Sniffing, what do you mean sniffing?
JERRY Sniffing, with his nose.
KRAMER Jerry, he probably had a cold.
JERRY No, I asked him.
KRAMER So, what are you saying?
JERRY I don't know, you know, what if...?
KRAMER Drugs? You think he's on drugs?
JERRY I don't know. All I know he was sniffing.
KRAMER Jerry, listen, we went in on a CD together.
JERRY I know.
KRAMER And Newman gave you money too. I didn't even meet this guy. We trusted you.
JERRY Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just means he was sniffing.
KRAMER Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? Did he use the word 'man'?
JERRY No, he didn't use 'man'.
KRAMER I mean when he was leaving did he say I'm splittin'?
JERRY No, but in one point he did use the bathroom.
KRAMER Whoh!
JERRY Do you think that's a bad sign?
KRAMER Yes!! Yes, that's what they do! They live in the bathroom! All right, what are we going to do? We are going to get our money back, right?
JERRY I don't know. This sweater really itches me. You want it?
KRAMER Yeah.
ELAINE Hello.... hello, oh...
JAKE Well, you notice anything?
ELAINE You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making dinner. Oh, you are a perfect, you are a perfect man.
JAKE Ooh...
ELAINE Did anyone call?
JAKE I got a few messages, I wrote them down.
ELAINE Where are they?
JAKE Lets see, they are...here they are.
ELAINE Thank you. Heh, I'll call you back.Ooh, Myra had the baby! Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called?
JAKE She did.
ELAINE She did? Oh, that's so great!
JAKE Where do you keep the corkscrew?
ELAINE In the drawer on the right. Hmm...
JAKE What?
ELAINE Oh it's nothing.
JAKE What is it?
ELAINE It's nothing.
JAKE Tell me.
ELAINE Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation point?
JAKE What are you talking about?
ELAINE See, right here you wrote "Myra had the baby", but you didn't use an exclamation point.
JAKE So?
ELAINE So, it's nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it curious.
JAKE What's so curious about it?
ELAINE Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point.
JAKE Well, maybe I don't use my exclamation points as haphazardly as you do.
ELAINE You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an exclamation point.
JAKE Hey, I just chalked down the message. I didn't know I was required to capture the mood of each caller.
ELAINE I just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby.
JAKE Ok, I'm excited. I just don't happen to like exclamation points.
ELAINE Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one!
JAKE Well, you can put one on this one: I'm leaving!
JERRY You're out of your mind you know that.
ELAINE What?
JERRY It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under it.
ELAINE Well, I felt a call for one.
JERRY A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything. I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation.
ELAINE I found it very troubling that he didn't use one.
JERRY George was right. Didn't take you long.
KRAMER Anything new on that guy on drugs?
ELAINE He's not on drugs.
KRAMER Then why the sniffing? Who walks around sniff, sniff sniffing?
ELAINE All right, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing right now.
JERRY Good idea.

NEWMAN I like the thick tape.
BARRY Heeyy!! What kind of a nut are you?
FARKUS So, basically the job here is quite simple. Selling bras.
GEORGE Well, that interests me very much Mr. Farkus.Very much indeed, sir.
FARKUS Have you ever sold a woman's line before?
GEORGE No, but I have very good repute with women, very good, top form. And the first time I laid my I on brassieres I was enthralled.
FARKUS Hum. tell me about it.
GEORGE Well, I was 14 years old. I was in my friends bathroom. His mother's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod. I picked it up, studied it. I thought, I like this. I didn't know what way or what level, but I knew: I wanted to be around brassieres.
FARKUS That's incredible story. You have a remarkable passion for brassieres.
GEORGE They are more than an underwear to me Mr.Farkus. Two cups in the front, two loops in the back. How do they do it?
FARKUS Well, I think I can say, barring some unforeseen incident, that you'll have a very bright future here at ED Granmont.
GEORGE Thank you Mr.Farkus, thank you very much indeed.
FARKUS See you monday 9 o'clock.
GEORGE If you don't mind, sir. I'll be here at 8.
FARKUS Excellent.
GEORGE So long, Mr. Farkus.
MS._DE_GRANMONT What you're think you're doing?
GEORGE Oh, nothing...
MS._DE_GRANMONT Farkus, get out here!
FARKUS Yes, Ms. De Granmont?
MS._DE_GRANMONT Who is this pervert little weasel?
FARKUS This is Costanza, he's our new bra salesman. He's supposed to start on monday.
MS._DE_GRANMONT If he's here on monday, you're not. Take a pick.
FARKUS_TO_GEORGE Get out!
ELAINE You wanted to see me, Mr. Lippman?
LIPPMAN I was just going over the Jake Jarmel book and I understand you worked with him very closely.
ELAINE Yes, krhm, yes I did.
LIPPMAN And, anyway I was just reading your final edit, um, there seems to be an inordinate number of exclamation points.
ELAINE Well, I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and intensity.
LIPPMAN Oh, "It was damp and chilly afternoon, so I decided to put on my sweatshirt!"
ELAINE Right, well...
LIPPMAN You put exclamation point after sweatshirt?
ELAINE That's that's correct, I-I felt that the character doesn't like to be ch-ch-chilly...
LIPPMAN I see, "I pulled the lever on the machine, but the Clark bar didn't come out!" Exclamation point?
ELAINE Well, yeah, you know how frustrating that can be when you keep putting quarters and quarters in to machine and then prrt nothing comes out...
LIPPMAN Get rid of the exclamation points...
ELAINE Ok, ok ok ...
LIPPMAN I hate exclamation points...
ELAINE ...ok I'll just....
JERRY 'Dear Barry. Consider this letter to be official termination of our relationship effective immediately.'
KRAMER Exclamation point.
ELAINE You still have no proof.
KRAMER Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy around me.
JERRY 'I will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later than the 18th'.
KRAMER Double exclamation point!
NEWMAN Will that take care of ours too?
JERRY Yeah, I'll give you yours as soon as I get my money back.
NEWMAN Hey, you want me to mail it? I'm on my way out anyway.
JERRY Yeah, thanks.
NEWMAN It'll be my pleasure.
NEWMAN See'ya later.
JERRY You know this...
KRAMER Hey, Ralph.
JERRY Hi Ralph.
RALPH What's up fellows? That'll be 14,30.
JERRY All right.
KRAMER Mushrooms, you got mushrooms Jerry?
JERRY Yeah.
KRAMER What's the matter? You've got a cold?
RALPH No Kramer, what is this?
KRAMER It's a sweater.
RALPH What's it made out of?
KRAMER I don't know, Jerry gave it to me.
JERRY Mohair, I think.
RALPH Mohair, that figures, I'm allergic to mohair.
JERRY You mean you just started sniffing?
RALPH Yeah, mohair does it to me every time.
JERRY I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry came in.
KRAMER Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar.
ELAINE The sweater! The sweater made him sniff! I told you he wasn't a drug addict.
JERRY Oh no! The letter, Newman, it's got exclamation points all over it!
KRAMER Not to mention the picture of him on the toilet.
JERRY The what??
NEWMAN After you.
WOMAN Thank you.
WOMAN Get your hands off of me! Johnny!!! Johnny!
FRANK What do you mean you felt the material? What, with your fingers like this?
GEORGE So what, what is so bad about that?
ESTELLE Who goes around feeling people's material? What can be gained feeling a person's material? It's insanity!
FRANK What ever happened to "Why, that's a lovely dress you have on. May I have this dance?"!!
ELAINE You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter.
JERRY Sorry I'm late, I just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
ELAINE What is this?
JERRY It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer.
ELAINE He is filing a chapter eleven. Why, what's going on, why is he filing a chapter eleven?
JERRY Bankruptcy, bankruptcy...as in I've taken your money and spent it on drugs!
ELAINE What do you mean, I thought it was the sweater.
KRAMER All right, What about the money?
JERRY What about the money? Apparently if I had dissolved my relationship with him prior to his filing chapter eleven, I've could've got the money back. Which I would've done, if for certain imbecile had been able to get to a mailbox and mail a letter!!
NEWMAN Pair of bear claws, please.
WOMAN Nice.
JERRY Think so?
WOMAN Yeah, what is it?
JERRY Half silk, half cotton, half linen. How can you go wrong?
JERRY What's with the age gap hiring policy at most movie theaters? Didja ever notice, they never hire anyone between the ages of fifteen... and eighty, you know what I mean? Like, the girl that sells you the ticket, she's ten. Then there's the guy who rips the ticket, he's a hundred and two. So, what happened in the middle, there? You couldn't find anybody? It's like they want to show you how life comes full circle. You're fifteen, you sell the tickets. Then you leave, you go out, you have a family, kids, marriage, career, grandchildren, eighty years later, you're back in the same theater three feet away. Ripping tickets. Took you eighty years to move three feet.
JERRY You don't understand. I got this all timed out. I got another
KERNIS I hear you, guy.
JERRY And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the material!
KERNIS Why don't you come back and do the 11 o'clock spot?
JERRY No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie "CheckMate" at 10:30.
BUCKLES Hey, Jer!
JERRY Heeeeyyyyyyyy.....
GEORGE Excuse me, do you have a ticket?
MAN No.
GEORGE Okay. Good.
BUCKLES Jerry!
JERRY What are doing here?
BUCKLES Hey, do you think this is funny? "Why do they call it athlete's foot? You don't have to be an athlete to get it. I mean, my father gets it all the time, and believe me, he's no athlete!"
ELAINE I've been dying to see "CheckMate".
GEORGE Well, if it's as good as "Ponce de Leon", I'll be happy.
ELAINE "Ponce de Leon", are you kidding me? I hated that movie!
GEORGE "Ponce de Leon"? But that was great!
ELAINE Oh, . That Fountain of Youth scene at the end, where they're all splashin' around, and then they go running over to the mirror to see if it really worked? I mean, come on! That's stupid!
GEORGE Lemme tell you sum'in. When Ponce looked in that mirror and saw that he hadn't changed, and that tear started to roll down his cheek? ... I lost it.
KRAMER Listen, I'm gonna get a hot dog at Payapa King.
GEORGE_AND_ELAINE No, wait!
GEORGE You're not going to get back here in time!
KRAMER I'm starvin', I haven't had any dinner!
ELAINE You can get a hot dog in the theater.
KRAMER I don't wanna get a movie hot dog! I want a Papaya King hot dog!
ELAINE Kramer, Jerry is going to be here any second, and then this line is going to start moving, and we're going to end up in the front row.
KRAMER Well, just save me a seat.
ELAINE No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that! I once had the fleece just ripped out of my winter coat in a seat-saving incident!
GEORGE I'm in line to buy.
ELAINE No, George, this is the ticket- line.
GEORGE No it's not, it's the ticket- line.
ELAINE Then how come we're not moving?
KRAMER Good question.
GEORGE Is this the ticket holders line, or the buyers?
MAN Holders.
GEORGE But I asked you before if you had a ticket, and you said no!
MAN I didn't. My friend was getting it.
GEORGE Good. It's good to be accurate like that.
ELAINE Can you believe him?
KRAMER He's spaced out.
ELAINE How long would you have stood in the ticket-holders line?
KRAMER 
ELAINE Yeah, exactly...
ELAINE I don't wanna go to a... miniplex multi-theater!
GEORGE It's the same movie! What's the difference?
ELAINE It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POWs to show them propaganda films.
JERRY Take the Park!
BUCKLES No no no, take 55th.
BUCKLES Jerry, I want you to do me a favor. No more fish!
JERRY Okay, I get your point!
BUCKLES I had a point?
GEORGE Hey, you know what else is playing here? "Rochelle Rochelle".
ELAINE Sigh/Ugh.
GEORGE I wouldn't mind seein' .
ELAINE Yeah. You know, men can sit through the most boring movie if there's even the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off.
GEORGE So what's your point?
GEORGE By the way, you owe me seven fifty.
ELAINE Oh, all right. Can you break a twenty?
GEORGE No, I don't have any change.
ELAINE Oh, well, then I'll pay you later.
GEORGE Or, I could take the twenty, then I could pay you later.
ELAINE Yeah, you could...
GEORGE Might be easier.
ELAINE I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe me twelve fifty instead of me owing you seven fifty.
GEORGE Either way.
ELAINE Yeah.
GEORGE So... Can I have it?
ELAINE I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda.
GEORGE Whaddya mean, you'll "get" the popcorn and the soda?
ELAINE I will buy your popcorn and soda. We'll call it even.
GEORGE I tell you what, you give me the twenty, and I will buy you a popcorn and soda, and I'll throw in a bon-bons.
ELAINE George, you're sappin' my strength.
GEORGE You go in and save seats.
ELAINE Me!? But that's three seats! I can't save three seats! I told you about that guy who tore up my winter coat!
BUCKLES Jerry, I want you to have this piece of material.
JERRY That's very nice of you, but I can't do the voices.
BUCKLES Jerry! Don't start up with me!
JERRY I gotta get out of this cab...
BUCKLES But Jerry, quit riffing!
JERRY No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring! Do you understand the difference?
BUCKLES Can you help me get on The Tonight Show?
ELAINE No, these are saved.
MAN All of them? C'mon, you can't take four seats.
ELAINE What, is that a rule?
GEORGE Well, why don't you go, and I could save the seats. You said you didn't like saving anyway.
ELAINE No, TAKEN, Taken, taken. I'm getting the hang of it.
GEORGE Why don't you give me the twenty, and I'll stop and get change, and then you and I can... uh... you-know, settle.
ELAINE Can we do this later, George?
GEORGE Psh. What's the point of even discussing it? You'll give me the money when you have it. I, I trust you.
KRAMER Could you do me a favor? If you see a guy that's five foot eleven, he's got uh a big head and flared nostrils, tell him his friend's going to be right back, okay?
ELAINE No, I'm sorry, these are taken. ... They're in the lobby buying popcorn. ... What are you doing? These are taken, these are taken!
WOMAN Which one?
ELAINE These two and this one. ... No! Don't come over here! These are taken. Go! Go! These are taken! They're taken! they're taken!
ELAINE Oh, take 'em.
GEORGE Um, excuse me, have you see a guy with like a horse face, big teeth, and a, and a pointed nose?
CLERK ... flared nostrils?
GEORGE Yeah.
CLERK Nope, haven't seen him.
BUCKLES Jerry, could you do me a personal favor? And if I'm out of line, please, let me know. Could I keep my trench coat in your closet for a few months?
JERRY Your trench coat in my closet?
BUCKLES Jerry, my closet is packed to the gills, I'm afraid to open the door. Just for a few months. It'll make all the difference in the world.
BUCKLES We should see "Rochelle Rochelle". I hear it's really hot.
JERRY No thanks, maybe some other time.
BUCKLES Really? Do you really mean that?
JERRY No, I don't.
BUCKLES You liked the athlete's foot bit, right?
JERRY No. No. I was kidding. It's terrible.
JERRY Hi, I got some friends inside, I gotta get a message to 'em. Mind if I walk through real quick?
USHER 
KRAMER Hey, did that guy show up?
CLERK The guy with the... horse face... and the big teeth...
KRAMER No, the guy with the big head and the flared nostrils.
CLERK Haven't seen him. There was a short guy with glasses... Looked like Humpty-Dumpty with a melon hat. But he left.
WOMAN So I got home, and he was vacuuming! I mean, he's twelve years old! Who else but my Alan would do something like that?
WOMAN And then last night, he put on my high heels. Oh, he put on such a show for us! He was dancing around, lip-sync'ing to "A Chorus Line", I mean you can see he's got talent.
ELAINE Excuse me, excuse me.
WOMAN What's the problem?
ELAINE You're talking.
WOMAN It's the "Coming Attractions".
WOMAN So anyway, he sings, he dances. And do you know what he's gotten into now? He is cooking! He does a crepe...
USHER Ticket, sir?
GEORGE Uh, I just went out, I went to look for my friend?
USHER Do you have your stub?
GEORGE My `stub'?
USHER Mm hm.
GEORGE You don't remember me?
USHER It's a big city, sir.
GEORGE I went in with a pretty woman? You know, kinda short, big wall o' hair, face like a frying pan?
GEORGE Elaine? Elaine! Elaine!
GEORGE Elaine!

GEORGE You uh owe me for the ticket.
KRAMER Yeah, right...
ELAINE What is that stain ?
KRAMER It's yellow mustard. Can you break a twenty?
JERRY I always get confused in the movie theater by the, by the plot. It's embarrassing. It's an embarrassment to have to admit, but I'm the one that you see in the parking lot after the movie guy from the ... Ohhhhhhhhhh..." Nobody will explain it to you. When you're in the theater, you can't find out. "Why did they kill that guy?... Why did they kill him?... Who was that guy? What was the... I thought he was with them? Wasn't he with them? Why would they kill him if he was with them? Oh, he wasn't really with them.... I thought he was with them. It's a good thing they killed him."
BILL Well, if the big man wants a new scoreboard, I don't wanna be the one to tell him no.
REILLY No-one in the park is gonna be able to see it from there.
GEORGE Well, why don't we just put a monitor in his skybox?
REILLY Hey George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.
GEORGE The ocean called. Running outta shrimp. Outta shrimp! Oh! Yes! That's what I shoulda said! Dammit!
JERRY 'The ocean called, They're running outta shrimp'?
GEORGE Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then, I said to him, 'Oh yeah? Well, the jerk store called, and they're running outta you.'
JERRY Really? That's great. You said that to him?
GEORGE Well, actually, I thought it up on the way over here.
JERRY Oh. That's not quite the same.
GEORGE No. No it's not. You don't know this guy. It woulda been so sweet.
JERRY I'm gonna grab a can of balls.
GEORGE Right.
MILOS Hello. My name is Milos. How can I help you.
JERRY I need a can of balls.
MILOS Can of balls for the nice guy, alri...
MILOS ...Ahh. You don't plan to hit these balls with that racquet, do you?
KRAMER Checking out the staff picks, Miss Benes?
ELAINE Oh. Ha-ha. Hey. Yeah, yeah. This Vincent guy, he is the best. He and I have the exact same taste in movies.
KRAMER Oh, Vincent is an art-house goon. I stick to the Gene rack.
ELAINE Gene? Oh, it's so stupid and mainstream.
KRAMER I've seen all these, so I went with a Kramer pick.
ELAINE 'The Other Side Of Darkness'. Huh, I never heard of that one.
KRAMER Yeah, went straight to video.
KRAMER That makes me the premiere.
ELAINE Hah.
KRAMER Jerry, have you ever seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness?
JERRY No.
KRAMER It's about this woman, in a coma. Well, I couldn't finish watching it, so I want you to read this.
JERRY 'I, Cosmo Kramer, having just seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness, and not wanting to be in a coma like that lady in the movie, hereby want Jerry Seinfeld to remove my life support, feeding machine, lung-blower, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.'
KRAMER Can you do that for me, buddy?
JERRY Well, I don't if what you have here constitutes a legally binding document.
KRAMER Well, I'm gonna type it up.
JERRY Yes, well, of course, but, even so, you may wanna talk to a lawyer.
KRAMER Yeah, but, Jackie Chiles, he put a restraining order on me. I'm not allowed within two hundred feet of his office. I couldn't even give him his Christmas present.
KRAMER Oh, hey, new racquet, huh?
JERRY Yeah. I wasn't gonna get it, but this guy Milos, who runs the pro shop, he really recommended it.
JERRY In fact, it's the only racquet he plays with.
KRAMER Well, you're not gonna need this any more.
JERRY Hey, this is the zee page of my address book.
KRAMER Oh yeah, I put all your zees on the weights and measures page.
ELAINE Oh. Oh, bravo, Vincent. Bravo.
ELAINE What?
VINCENT Did you enjoy the movie?
ELAINE Who is it?
VINCENT It's Vincent.
ELAINE Of Vincent's picks?
VINCENT The same.
JERRY He called you?
ELAINE He musta got my number off the computer. We ended up talking for, like, two hours.
JERRY To a guy you've never met? Your screening process is getting ever more rigorous.
ELAINE Trying to meet him. He's never at the video store. They said he sets his own hours.
PLAYER Little help, hey!
ELAINE Yeah.
PLAYER Thank you.
ELAINE Oh god, that guy's terrible.
JERRY Mmm-hmm.
ELAINE Hey, how come we played at this crummy place instead of your club?
JERRY George used up all my guest passes already.
ELAINE Ah.
PLAYER Ahh.
JERRY Come on.
PLAYER Thank you.
JERRY Here you go.
JERRY Milos?
MILOS Oh, hey. How you doing?
MILOS Okay, we should uh, wrap it up here.
ELAINE So he was bad. What d'you care?
JERRY Elaine, I paid two hundred dollars for this racquet, because he said it's the only one he plays with. He could've played just as well with a log.
KRAMER Hey. Right, I talked to this lawyer guy, Shellbach. Now, he's gonna set me up, but you gotta come with me and be the executor.
ELAINE The executor? Of what?
JERRY Kramer wants to die with dignity.
ELAINE There's a feather in your cap.
KRAMER I don't wanna be a vegetable, Elaine. I just want out.
GEORGE Sometimes in life, the gods smile upon you, my friends.
JERRY D'you get someone to take that Canadian quarter?
GEORGE I got another meeting with Reilly. A whole new audience, and I bet I can get him to try that line again.
ELAINE Who's Reilly?
JERRY George was scarfing shrimp at this meeting, and this guy says 'Hey, George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.'
GEORGE Listen to the comeback. 'Oh yeah? Well the jerk store called. They're running outta you.'
GEORGE Wha...You gotta be kidding me?!
ELAINE How 'bout this one? How 'bout, 'Your cranium called. It's got some space to rent.'?
GEORGE What does that mean?
JERRY Hey, here you go. 'Hey, Reilly. The zoo called. You're due back by six.'
GEORGE No. No, no, no. You're not helping me.
KRAMER Look, just tell him you had sex with his wife. That'll kill him.
GEORGE I'm not looking for another line. I got the line.
KRAMER Look, George, just think about it. You know, you're married, how would you feel if somebody says to you that they just had se...
GEORGE Alright, alright. You see? This is why I hate writing with a large group. Everybody has their own little opinions, and it all gets homogenised, and you lose the whole edge of it. I'm going with jerk store! Jerk store is the line! Jerk store! Yess!
KRAMER Did you take this out of the garbage?
JERRY Yeah, it's still got some spring in the strings.
KRAMER Oh, Jerry, this is a piece of junk. How are you gonna be the executor of my living will?
KRAMER You see? You can't let go.
JERRY Trust me, Kramer. Given the legal opportunity, I will kill you.
KRAMER I wish I could believe you. Hey, Elaine, do you have some free time tomorrow afternoon?
ELAINE Me?
KRAMER Yeah, because you're perfect. You're a calculating, cold-hearted businesswoman. And when there's dirty work to be done, you don't mind stomping on a few throats.
ELAINE Oh, ho, c'mon.
SHELLBACH Situation number four. You're breathing on your own, you're conscious, but with no muscular function.
KRAMER Well, would I be able to communicate?
SHELLBACH I don't see how.
ELAINE Ach, I don't like the sound of this one.
KRAMER Huhh, yeah, let's pull the cord.
ELAINE Yank it like you're starting a mower.
SHELLBACH Moving on. You have liver, kidneys and gall bladder, but no central nervous system.
KRAMER Well, I gotta have a central nervous system.
SHELLBACH Okay. One lung, blind and you're eating through a tube.
KRAMER Naw, that's not my style.
ELAINE Bore-ing.
SHELLBACH Alright, you can eat. But machines do everything else.
KRAMER Uhm...
ELAINE I'd stick.
KRAMER Yeah, yeah. Stick. 'Cos I could still go to the coffee shop.
ELAINE That's right.
JERRY Hello Milos.
MILOS Jerry, thank god you got my message. Thank you so much for coming down here. Uhm, listen...
JERRY You know, I spent two hundred dollars on a racquet because I thought you knew what you were talking about.
MILOS I..I...
I..I... JERRY
JERRY You can't even play.
MILOS Believe me, it is Milos great shame. But Jerry, I could lose my business if anybody find out. How would you like extra year membership of the club? Free. No charge.
JERRY You could do that?
MILOS Jerry, for you, anything.
JERRY Game, set and match, huh Milos?
MILOS Hah, Jerry, I am so sorry. they tell me there is no way they can do it. Is there anything else I can do for you? Anything at all. I refund your money.
JERRY You know what Milos, I don't even care about the money. I just feel like I was taken by the worst tennis player I...
MILOS Shhh-shhh. I make it up to you.
JERRY Yeah, you'll make it up to me.
JERRY Tennis, anyone?
ELAINE Oh, this is the one Vincent told me about. The Pain And The Yearning. 'An old woman experiences pain and yearning.' A hundred and ninety-two minutes?
KRAMER That's a lotta yearning, huh?
ELAINE You know, these movies are great, but they're just so emotionally exhausting.
KRAMER Yeah, well, what you need is some summertime adolescent high jinx.
ELAINE Really?
KRAMER See what doctor Gene prescribes, huh? Oh, here, look at that. Weekend At Bernies Two. Now, that's an hilarious premise.
ELAINE Huh. Well...
KRAMER Yeah.
ELAINE Yeah, I could use a chuckle. Elaine returns the 'Vincent' pick to the shelf and walks toward the counter with the Bernie's tape.
KRAMER Yeah.
ELAINE What're you getting?
KRAMER Nothing, I'm gonna finish watching The Other Side Of Darkness.
ELAINE Oh. How much you got left?
KRAMER Yeah, about two hours.
KRAMER Yeah, she shot in that coma pretty quick.
ELAINE Bernie is dead, you moron! Just because he's wearing sunglasses he looks alive?! Ugh, how long is this weekend, anyway? Ugh!
ELAINE Hello.
VINCENT How's the movie. Elaine?
ELAINE Vincent?
VINCENT The Gene pick. How could you? I thought we had something special.
ELAINE No, it doesn't mean anything. I'm not even gonna rewind it.
ELAINE Vincent?
FRED Alright, let's get to it.
GEORGE Wha..wait a minute, wha..what about Reilly?
FRED Reilly doesn't work here any more.
GEORGE What? I..I didn't hear about that.
FRED Oh, we only wake you up for the important meetings.
PATTY Hello.
JERRY Hello. Didn't I see you at the pro shop yesterday?
PATTY I think so. I'm Patty. Milos gave me your address. I hope you don't mind me waiting for you here.
JERRY Hoh, that Milos. Well uh, what shall we do, uhm, care for a cup of coffee?
PATTY Why don't we just go up to your apartment?
JERRY Alright.
JERRY Gotta be an easier way.
NURSE Doctor, how's her coma?
DOCTOR Oh, exactly the same.
DOCTOR Wait a minute, she's coming out of the coma.
DOCTOR Mrs Allbright, can you hear me? Are you okay?
ALLBRIGHT I feel so rested and refreshed. Get me a toothbrush.
JERRY So, you play tennis?
PATTY Enough talk, Jerry.
JERRY Not for me, I love chatting.
PATTY Shh.
PATTY No! No, I can't do this. I can't go through with it. Not even for him!
JERRY Who?
PATTY Milos. My husband!
JERRY Your husband?!
GEORGE So concerned was he, that word of his poor tennis skills might leak out, he chose to offer you his wife as some sort of mediaeval sexual payola?
JERRY He's new around here.
GEORGE So, details?
JERRY Well, I didn't sleep with her.
GEORGE Because of society, right?
JERRY Yes, George, because of society. So how did the big meeting turn out?
GEORGE Reilly is no longer with the club. You believe that?
JERRY Ah, you're better off. Now you can just let it go.
GEORGE Yeah, I'm gonna let it go.
JERRY You never really had the right comeback, anyway.
GEORGE Are you insane? Jerk store, woulda smoked that guy! Smoked him, I say.
KRAMER Hey. Oh, Jerry, listen uh, you know, I saw the rest of that movie, The Other Side Of Darkness? The coma lady wakes up at the end.
GEORGE Ohh, I wanted to see that. Thanks. Thanks a lot.
KRAMER I didn't know it was possible to come out of a coma.
JERRY I didn't know it was possible not to know that.
GEORGE How was Eric Roberts as the husband?
KRAMER Oh, unforgettable.
GEORGE Oww.
KRAMER I gotta find Elaine. Y'know, she's gonna pull my plug.
ELAINE What? Betrayed? Oh, Vincent, I'm so sorry. I...
KRAMER Yeah, listen, uh, Elaine, I've changed my mind about the whole coma thing. Yeah, I decided I'm up for it.
ELAINE Kramer, do you have any idea what you've done?
MANAGER Excuse me.
ELAINE What're you doing?
ELAINE Wha..wha...?
MANAGER Vincent stopped making picks.
ELAINE Well, how am I gonna know what movies to see?
MANAGER We have a wide variety of Gene picks.
ELAINE Gene's trash.
MANAGER I'm Gene.
ELAINE Hi.
JERRY Milos, I can assure you, I had no intention of telling anyone about your unbelievably bad tennis playing.
MILOS Thank you, but, unfortunately, I have much larger problems to fry. My wife, she has no respect for Milos anymore.
JERRY I guess that's a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade.
MILOS Patty, she, she loves tennis, as much like I do. Wou..would you, wi..will you let me beat you in tennis? That is the only way I can show her I am still a man.
JERRY Well, I'll do it as long as there's no other girls around. I mean, I wanna be a man too.
JERRY So you hurt Vincent's feelings?
ELAINE Look what came in the mail today.
JERRY Wh..What's this?
ELAINE It's the play button, off his VCR.
JERRY Boy, look how far back it goes. It's like a tooth.
GEORGE So, guess where Mr 'Ocean phoned' turned up? He's working for Firestone, in Akron, Ohio.
ELAINE Ohio? Mark's Michelle is a dog.
GEORGE Yep. I'm leaving first thing tomorrow morning.
JERRY You're flying to Akron, just to zing a guy?
GEORGE Don't you understand? It's not about him. To have a line as perfect as 'jerk store' and to never use it. I, I couldn't live with myself.
ELAINE See, there are no jerk stores. It..it's just a little confusing, is all.
GEORGE It's smart. It's a smart line, and a smart crowd will appreciate it. And, I'm not gonna dumb it down for some bonehead mass audience!
GEORGE Not you.
OLD_WOMAN Oh, brittle bones. How I long to be rid of the pain.
ELAINE Hello.
VINCENT Elaine? It's Vincent.
ELAINE Vincent. Where are you? I have to meet you.
VINCENT No. I can't bear to have anyone see me.
ELAINE Vincent, listen, I won't judge you the way everyone else does. You're, you're strange and beautiful, and sensitive. Now, let's have a look at you.
VINCENT Alright, but, can you bring me few things from the store? I haven't been out in a while.
KRAMER Well, go around, you bunch of crazies. You maniacs are gonna get us all killed.
SECRETARY Hi, can I help you?
KRAMER Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm Cosmo Kramer. Yeah, I had an appointment to annul my living will.
SECRETARY Oh. Mr Kramer, you had a ten-thirty appointment. It's two o'clock. Mr Shellbach had a tennis lesson. He's gone for the day.
JERRY Too good.
MILOS Another game for Milos!! Hahaha! Milos walks to the net to meet Jerry.
JERRY You're on fire today.
MILOS Hey Patty. look at this guy. He's awful! Patty blows Milos a kiss.
MILOS He's not a man, this Jerry. He's not even married like I am. Huhuhuhu.
JERRY Hey, uh, Milos, I don't mind rolling over here, but could you lighten up on the 'not a man' stuff?
MILOS Hey everybody, look! The little chicken girl wants me to ease up. He can't handle this, so he cries like a woman! Hahaha!
ELAINE Hello? Vincent?
VINCENT Elaine?
ELAINE I got what you asked.
VINCENT Just, leave it and go.
ELAINE W..well, can't I come in?
VINCENT No. Go away. Now.
ELAINE No, no. Vincent, I... Don't shut me out. I just, I know you feel what I feel. A woman comes up behind Elaine.
WOMAN Excuse me. Can I help you?
VINCENT Aw, dammit!
ELAINE Uh, uhm, I'm, I'm here to see Vincent.
WOMAN Well, I'm his mother. Vincent, what's going on here?
VINCENT No, my acne!
ELAINE Ahh-cnee.
WOMAN What d'you have here?
WOMAN Vodka, cigarettes, fireworks. What kind of a sick woman brings this to a fifteen year old?
ELAINE We have the same taste in movies.
WOMAN Did he send you part of our VCR?
ELAINE Yeah. Vincent's mother holds out her hand, and Elaine pulls the chain over her head and hands it over.
WOMAN Vincent!
MILOS Look at the big baby! Hehaha. Hey, big baby, are you wetting yourself? Maybe it is time for you to be changed. Hahah.
JERRY I told you to cut it out.
MILOS Hey, c'mon, what're you doing? Huhuh. The baby got lucky on that one! Hahah.
KRAMER Shellbach.
KRAMER Racquet.
REILLY So, George. You're proposing a snow tyre day at Yankee Stadium?
GEORGE Long as they don't throw 'em on the field. Huhu. Help yourself to some shrimp, I brought enough for everybody.
MCADAM I have to say this, this proposal doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
GEORGE Well, you never know. Let's see how many I can fit in my mouth. George begins picking up shrimp one by one and stuffing them into his mouth.
REILLY You know, George...
REILLY The ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.
GEORGE Oh yeah, Reilly? Well, the jerk store called. They're running outta you
REILLY What's the difference? You're their all-time best seller!
GEORGE Yeah? Well, I had sex with your wife.
MCADAM His wife is in a coma.
ELAINE Hi. How's he doing?
JERRY He's been sleeping a lot. He's still groggy.
ELAINE Oh. I thought a movie might cheer him up. I got him a Gene pick.
JERRY What happened to Vincent?
ELAINE I'm kinda off of him. Uh, outlet?
ELAINE Ah.
KRAMER Waahhh!!!
GEORGE 'My wife's in a coma.' Yeah? Well, the life support machine called and...
GEORGE Wait! Yes! That's what I should've said! D'ohh!
GEORGE Huh haha! You're meat, Reilly! You just screwed yourself! Ha ha!
GEORGE Say you, me, and Kramer are, uh, flying over the Andes.
JERRY Why are we flyin' over the Andes?
GEORGE We got a soccer game in Chile. Anyway, the plane crashes. Who are you gonna eat to survive?
JERRY Kramer.
GEORGE So fast? What about me?
JERRY No.
GEORGE Kramer's so stringy. I'm plump, juicy.
JERRY Kramer's got more muscle, higher protein content. It's better for you.
GEORGE Well I would eat you.
JERRY That's very nice, I guess.
GEORGE I still don't see why you wouldn't eat me. I'm your best friend.
JERRY Look, if other people are having some, I'll try you.
GEORGE Thank you.
JERRY Can I have a piece of that?
GEORGE No.
LOUISE George, I can't have sex.
GEORGE With me or in general?
LOUISE I went to the doctor today. I have mono.
GEORGE Nucleosis.
LOUISE Oh I hope it's not a problem for you.
GEORGE No, no, pff...
LOUISE How long is this not gonna be a problem for me?
JERRY Six weeks?
GEORGE Yeah, six weeks.
JERRY Well, so what? you've gone six weeks before.
GEORGE I can do six weeks standin' on my head. I'm a sexual camel. That's not the point. At least there was the possibility.
JERRY Well, so, are you gonna break up with her?
GEORGE I don't know. I don't wanna be one of those guys.
JERRY What guys?
GEORGE Like us.
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE So it's just mono.
ELAINE Mono? Huh, well, if anyone needs any medical advise, Elaine met a doctor. And he's unattached.
JERRY I thought the whole dream of dating a doctor was debunked.
ELAINE No, it's not debunked, it's totally bunk.
JERRY Isn't bunk bad? Like, that's a lot of bunk.
GEORGE No something is bunk and then you debunk it.
JERRY What?
ELAINE Huh?
GEORGE I think.
ELAINE Look it, I'm dating a doctor and I like it. Let's just move on.
JERRY Hello?
KATIE Jerry.
JERRY Oh hi, Katie.
KATIE Listen, something just came up for Tuesday at the Dayton Civic Center. That's Ohio, Jerry.
JERRY I've heard of Ohio, Katie. But Tuesday's no good. I'm doin' career day at my old junior high.
KATIE Okay, Jerry. that's fine. you're the boss. Katie works for Jerry.
JERRY Yes, all right, Katie.
KATIE Sorry for the late notice.
JERRY Yes, bye.
KATIE You're the--
GEORGE They asked you to do career day?
JERRY Yeah, it's no big deal.
GEORGE Oh with all due respect, I went there too, and I work for a team that just won the World Series.
JERRY And you were integral.
TEACHER Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here.
JERRY I'm on next, right?
TEACHER Well, unfortunately, Mr. O'Meary from the Bronx zoo...
JERRY The guy with the lizard.
TEACHER Yes. Well, he started feedin' it crickets, and the children just love him. And we're outta time.
TEACHER So can you come back tomorrow?
JERRY I'm getting bumped? You're bumping me from career day?
ELAINE So do most doctors like ER or do you guys just think it's fake?
BEN I couldn't tell you. You know, I'm not really a doctor.
ELAINE Oh, yeah. And I'm not really attracted to you.
BEN Well, I'm serious, Elaine. I went to medical school, but I still have to pass my licensing exam.
ELAINE When do you take this exam?
BEN I've taken it. Three times. I almost passed the last one.
ELAINE Well, you're basically a doctor. Right? I mean, people do call you doctor.
BEN Well, um...
ELAINE Well, can I introduce you as doctor?
BEN Yeah.
ELAINE All right, that's all I wanted to know.
LOUISE Mono.
GEORGE It was fantastic, Jerry. We wound up talking all night.
JERRY So you're enjoying the not enjoying.
GEORGE you know, just by conversing, you can really learn a lot about a person.
JERRY I'm finding that out.
KRAMER Hey, buddy. How was career day?
JERRY Ah, I didn't get on. The lizard guy went long.
GEORGE You got bumped from career day?
JERRY It was a mix-up, I'm sure.
KRAMER They're trying to screw with your head.
JERRY Now why would a junior high school want to screw with my head?
KRAMER Why does Radio Shack ask for your phone number when you buy batteries? I don't know.
GEORGE Hey, hey. Kramer, what are you doing? You can't smoke in here.
KRAMER No, come on.
LARRY Take it outside.
KRAMER Come on, Larry. You know me.
LARRY It bothers people, and it's against the law.
JERRY You can make all the laws you want, he's still gonna bother people.
KRAMER What, did they kick you out too?
MAN Yeah, they kicked us all out.
TEACHER Thanks so much for coming back, Jerry. Care for a graham cracker?
JERRY No, let's just do it. What? What is going on? What is that about?
TEACHER Fire drill. Sorry. Single file everyone!
JERRY But I was promised this slot.
TEACHER Single file, Jerry.
JERRY Fire drill, can you believe that?
GEORGE What is Pericles?
ALEX_TREBEK Pericles is correct.
JERRY Like fire in a school is such a big deal.
KRAMER Hey, you got any matches?
JERRY Middle drawer.
GEORGE Who is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?
ALEX_TREBEK We were looking for 'Who is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.'
KRAMER Thanks.
JERRY Hello?
KATIE Jerry.
JERRY Oh hi, Katie.
KATIE I heard what happened to the junior high. They can't bump you like that. That is so unprofessional.
JERRY Oh relax, Katie. It's not a problem.
GEORGE What is Borax?
ALEX_TREBEK Yes, you're right.
KATIE They bump you in junior high, the next thing you know you're being bumped in high schools, colleges, trade schools. Before you know it, Letterman's not returning your calls.
KRAMER Ashtrays?
JERRY No, I don't have any ashtrays.
KRAMER Ooh, cereal bowls.
KATIE Jerry, now don't freak out, I'll take care of it.
JERRY No, Katie, don't--
KRAMER All right, thanks.
GEORGE What is Tungsten or Wolfram?
ALEX_TREBEK We were looking for 'What is Tungsten, or Wolfram'.
JERRY Is this a repeat?
GEORGE No, no, no. Just lately, I've been thinking a lot clearer. Like this afternoon, what is chicken Kiev, I really enjoyed watching a documentary with Louise.
JERRY Louise! That's what's doin' it. You're no longer pre-occupied with sex, so your mind is able to focus.
GEORGE You think?
JERRY Yeah. I mean, let's say this is your brain. Okay, from what I know about you, your brain consists of two parts: the intellect, represented here , and the part obsessed with sex. Now granted, you have extracted an astonishing amount from this little scrap. But with no-sex-Louise, this previously useless lump, is now functioning for the first time in its existence.
GEORGE Oh my God. I just remembered where I left my retainer in second grade. I'll see ya.
KRAMER Need some more matches.
JERRY What is goin' on in there?
KRAMER I met some people smoking on the street, so I invited them up to my apartment to smoke.
JERRY Why?
KRAMER Well somebody had to. You know, just because a person's a smoker, that doesn't mean he's not a human being.
JERRY It doesn't?
KRAMER Jerry, these people aren't just going to let themselves be flicked into the ashbin of society.
JERRY why not?
KRAMER Well you can confine them, you can punish them, you can cram them into the corner, but they're not going away, Jerry.
JERRY All right.
KRAMER Yeah.
ELAINE So when they're handing you those cadavers, do you get to choose whether it's a man or a woman?
BEN I dunno. Dead bodies really gross me out.
ELAINE Oh my God.
BEN What's wrong?
ELAINE It's Sue Ellen Mischke, this old braless friend I hate.
SUE_ELLEN Elaine? Hi.
ELAINE Oh hi, Sue Ellen.
SUE_ELLEN Oh Rick, this is an old, old, friend of mine, Elaine Benes. Rick is a periodontist. He does Giuliani's gums.
ELAINE Well, this is my boyfriend, doctor Ben Gelfen.
BEN Well, I'm an intern.
ELAINE Hey, stop kidding me. He's a doctor. He's a very good doctor.
WOMAN Carlitto's just passed out. Can anyone help?
ELAINE Well, there's a doctor right here.
BEN No there's not.
ELAINE Can't you at least tell him what to do?
BEN Like what?
SUE_ELLEN Shouldn't he elevate his legs?
BEN Right. Elevate your legs!
ELAINE I hope Carlitto feels better. Ben really wishes he could've helped.
LARRY I thought he was a doctor.
ELAINE Oh he is. Kind of. I mean, I call him doctor. George.
GEORGE Of course. Absolute zero!
ELAINE What? What is with all these books?
GEORGE I stopped having sex.
KRAMER All right, I'll see ya Bill. All right, I got room for two, but the only thing I have is in the non-filter section. Hey.
JERRY Hey. Wh-What'd you got, a smoker's lounge in there?
KRAMER Oh yeah, people really seem to be enjoying themselves. You know, they come in once, it's like they're addicted.
KATIE Jerry, oh there you are. You didn't answer the phone.
JERRY I was out.
KATIE Oh. Jerry, great news. I got you an assembly.
JERRY An assembly?
KATIE Two hours in front of the entire junior high, grades six through eight. That's six grade, seventh grade--
JERRY I understand. But what am I gonna talk about for two hours?
KATIE And, it is already in the school paper. They cancelled Rick James.
JERRY Superfreak?
KATIE Yes.
ELAINE What is your answer to number 74?
BEN Medobolic acidosis.
ELAINE No! Hypocalimia, not medibolic acidosis. Duh!
BEN Man, I'm never gonna pass this thing.
ELAINE Oh yes you are. We'll just stop having sex.
GEORGE Guys, hitting is not about muscle. It's simple physics. Calculate the velocity, v, in relation to the trajectory, t, in which g, gravity, of course remains a constant. It's not complicated.
JETER Now who are you again?
GEORGE George Costanza, assistant to the traveling secretary.
WILLIAMS Are you the guy who put us in that Ramada in Milwaukee?
GEORGE Do you wanna talk about hotels, or do you wanna win some ball games?
JETER We won the World Series.
GEORGE In six games.
JERRY ...so if you like to tell jokes, and love to make people laugh, stand-up comedy may be the career for you.
GEORGE Nine minutes.
JERRY How am I gonna fill two hours?
GEORGE Hello? I can take an hour off your hands. Give the kids a chance to see a real live Yankee.
JERRY And give you the chance to see some real disappointed kids.
WAITRESS More coffee?
GEORGE Excuse me, darling, do I detect a Portuguese accent?
WAITRESS Si
GEORGE Das kaffes un salat e grand por favor.
WAITRESS Mute pragalas senor
GEORGE Eh, don't mention it.
ELAINE Portuguese?
GEORGE Yeah, my cleaning lady's Portuguese. I must've picked it up.
ELAINE How come he's gettin' so smart? I stopped having sex with Ben three days ago and I don't know no Portuguese?
JERRY Are you all right?
ELAINE I don't know. It's just the last coupla days my mind has been, not good.
JERRY Wait a second, I know what's happening. The no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you.
ELAINE What? What are you talking about?
JERRY To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through. You're stupid.
ELAINE I don't understand.
JERRY Exactly.
KRAMER Hey buddy.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER Hey, you should come over. Tonight's pipe night.
JERRY What? What happened to your face? It looks like an old catcher's mitt.
KRAMER What?
KRAMER My face is all craggly, it's crinkly.
JERRY It's from all that smoke. You've experienced a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect?
KRAMER Emphysema, birth defects, cancer. But not this. Jerry, my face is my livelihood. Everything I have I owe to this face.
JERRY And your teeth, your teeth are all brown.
KRAMER Look away, I'm hideous.
ELAINE Hey, Ben. I need a four letter word. Winnie the blank. B Pooh!
ELAINE Pooh... B No, it's Winnie the Pooh.
LOUISE So the hospital called, turns out some stupid intern screwed up my test. I never had mono. So we can... you know.
JERRY So what did you do?
GEORGE I told her I would have to think about it.
JERRY But ultimately, you're gonna choose in favor of sex, right?
GEORGE I don't know. Perhaps I can better serve the world this way.
JERRY You mean, not subjecting yourself to your sexual advances.
GEORGE Simple joke from a simple man.
JERRY So you're never gonna have sex again?
GEORGE Well, Jerry. There was a pretty good chance I was never gonna have sex again anyway.
JERRY So you ready for the assembly tomorrow? You know what you're gonna say about the Yankees?
GEORGE Oh, sports are so pedestrian. I've prepared some science experiments that will illuminate the mind and dazzle the eye.
JERRY I wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework stinks.
JACKIE My vacation was restful, splendid, magnificent. In fact, next time I'm plannin' on going to Kofu.
JACKIE Oh no.
KRAMER Jackie we gotta talk.
JACKIE No way, Kramer. You've brought nothing but a mountain of misfortune and humiliation. Now get out.
KRAMER But Jackie--
JACKIE I said out.
KRAMER Jackie, I think I gotta case against the tobacco companies.
JACKIE The who?
KRAMER The tobacco companies.
JACKIE I've been wanting a piece of them for years.
JACKIE Did that cigarette warning label mention anything about damage to your appearance?
KRAMER No, it didn't say anything.
JACKIE So you're a victim. Now your face is shallow, unattractive, disgusting.
KRAMER So Jackie, do you think we gotta case?
JACKIE Your face is my case.
JERRY How ya doin'?
ELAINE Not good. I'm a moron.
JERRY Well, don't worry about it. Once he passes the test, you'll have sex again, and you'll be fine.
ELAINE Well, that kinda brings us to why I'm here. You got eleven minutes?
JERRY What for? Oh come on.
ELAINE I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing to do with you.
JERRY I think it has something to do with me.
ELAINE You could read the paper through the whole thing if you want.
JERRY No, no, no. I'm sorry, it's too weird.
ELAINE Oh, all right. Is Kramer home?
GEORGE You know, Louise. I think you'll find this amusing. In early Euclidean geometry--
LOUISE George, I have to have sex.
GEORGE I used to share that same outlook. But now, I have so many things to occupy my mind. For instance, the atom.
LOUISE Goodbye, George. I hate you.
GEORGE What a fascinating turn of events.
WAITRESS Mas Caf�?
GEORGE Si, por favor.
JACKIE Miss Wilkie, your tobacco company has turned this beautiful specimen, into a horrible twisted freak.
KRAMER Who could love me?
WILKIE I disagree. In fact, I feel Mr. Kramer projects a rugged masculinity.
JACKIE Rugged? The man's a goblin. He's only been exposed to smoke for four days. By the time this case gets to trial, he'll be nothing more than a shrunken head.
WILKIE All right, Mr. Chiles. You'll have our offer by tomorrow. Good day, gentlemen.
KRAMER Bye-bye. Jackie, you did it. We're rich.
JACKIE You better believe it. Jackie's cashin' in on your wretched disfigurement.
ELAINE Congratulations! You passed!
BEN Elaine, Elaine. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
ELAINE What? you're breaking up with me? But I sacrificed and supported you while you struggled. What about my dream of dating a doctor?
BEN I'm sorry, Elaine. I always knew that after I became a doctor, I would dump whoever I was with and find someone better. That's the dream of becoming a doctor.
ELAINE Look it, are we going to have sex, or not?
KATIE Okay, Jerry, now when the glee club's finished singing, George goes on, then you.
GEORGE Hey.
JERRY Where have you been? You know, you're on next.
GEORGE I got lost on the way over.
JERRY Got lost? We went to school here for three years.
GEORGE What are these? Take me to your leader.
JERRY Oh my God. You had sex. You had sex with Louise!
GEORGE No, the Portuguese waitress.
JERRY The Portuguese waitress?
GEORGE I calculated my odds of ever getting together with a Portuguese waitress. Mathematically, I had to do it, Jerry.
KATIE George, George, you're on.
GEORGE No, no. I'm not going on.
JERRY Then what'd you come down here for?
GEORGE Tell you about the Portuguese waitress.
JERRY It's good to have you back.
KATIE One of you has to go on.
JERRY All right, I'll do it. Hey kids. What's the deal with homework? you're not working on your home!
KRAMER It was a great lunch, Jackie. Thanks.
JACKIE It's a little puzzling we haven't gotten that offer yet.
KRAMER Mrs. Wilkie, from the tobacco company called me. We had a little pow-wow.
JACKIE A pow-wow? Who told you to have a pow-wow? I didn't tell you to have pow-wow.
KRAMER She made an offer. I took it.
JACKIE How much?
KRAMER No, no, no. There was no money.
JACKIE No money? Then what'd we get?
KRAMER Check it out.
JACKIE This is the most public yet of my many humiliations.
JERRY Cancelled? But I was supposed to be on tomorrow night.
LETTERMAN Yeah, but then, you know, some people were telling me about that little flap out there at the junior high assembly. And before that, you were bumped by a lizard? JERRY: ACTUALLY, IT WAS A .
LETTERMAN those things, deadly dangerous. A long time ago my uncle and a date are driving, like, through Mexico. They see one on the road, drags him out of the road, and chews his face off. Listen, we'll call you if anything opens up. Okay, Jimmy?
JERRY Jerry.
LETTERMAN Right. Jerry.
STU Excuse me, Jerry? I'm Stu Chermak. I'm with NBC.
JERRY Hi.
STU Could we speak for a few moments?
JERRY Sure.
JAY Hi, Jay Crespi.
JERRY Hello.
GEORGE Uh, C-R-E-S-P-I?
JAY That's right.
GEORGE I'm unbelievable at spelling last names. Give me a last name.
JAY Mm, I'm not-
JERRY George-
GEORGE Huh? All right, fine.
STU First of all, that was a terrific show.
JERRY Oh thank you very much.
STU And basically, I just wanted to let you know that we've been discussing you at some of our meetings and we'd be very interested in doing something.
JERRY Really? Wow.
STU So, if you have any idea for like a tv show for yourself, well, we'd just love to talk about it.
JERRY I'd be very interested in something like that.
STU Well, here, uh, why don't you give us a call and maybe we can develop a series. They start to exit.
JERRY Okay. Great. Thanks.
STU It was very nice meeting you.
JERRY Thank you.
JAY Nice meeting you.
JERRY Nice meeting you.
GEORGE What was that all about?
JERRY They said they were interested in me.
GEORGE For what?
JERRY You know, a tv show.
GEORGE Your own show?
JERRY Yeah, I guess so.
GEORGE They want you to do a tv show?
JERRY Well, they want me to come up with an idea. I mean, I don't have any ideas.
GEORGE Come on, how hard is that? Look at all the junk that's on tv. You want an idea? Here's an idea. You coach gymnastics team in high school. And you're married. And your son's not interested in gymnastics and you're pushing him into gymnastics.
JERRY Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics?
GEORGE Because you're a gymnastics teacher. It's only natural.
JERRY But gymnastics is not for everybody.
GEORGE I know, but he's your son.
JERRY So what?
GEORGE All right, forget that idea, it's not for you....Okay, okay, I got it. You run an antique store.
JERRY Yeah and...?
GEORGE And people come in the store and you get involved in their lives.
JERRY What person who runs an antique store gets involved in people's lives?
GEORGE Why not?
JERRY So someone comes in to buy an old lamp and all of a sudden I'm getting them out of a jam? I could see if I was a pharmacist because a pharmacist knows what's wrong with everybody that comes in.
GEORGE I know, but antiques are very popular right now.
JERRY No they're not, they used to be.
GEORGE Oh yeah, like you know.
JERRY Oh like you do.
KRAMER ...And you're the manager of the circus.
JERRY A circus?
KRAMER Come on, this is a great idea. Look at the characters. You've got all these freaks on the show. A woman with a moustache? I mean, who wouldn't tune in to see a women with a moustache? You've for the tallest man in the world; a guy who's just a head.
JERRY I don't think so.
KRAMER Look Jerry, the show isn't about the circus, it's about watching freaks.
JERRY I don't think the network will go for it.
KRAMER Why not?
JERRY Look, I'm not pitching a show about freaks.
KRAMER Oh come on Jerry, you're wrong. People they want to watch freaks. This is a "can't miss."
NEWMAN Kramer.
JERRY Hello Newman.
NEWMAN Come on lets go. I got the helmet. Lets get the radar detector.
KRAMER All right I'll be back in a second. You guys coming to my party?
TOGETHER Yeah, sure.
JERRY What's this all about?
NEWMAN We're making a trade. I'm giving him my motorcycle helmet - he's giving me his radar detector.
JERRY I didn't know you had a motorctcle.
NEWMAN Well my girlfriend had one.
JERRY You have a girlfriend?
NEWMAN I HAD a girlfriend and she was pretty wild.
JERRY I never remember you with a girl.
NEWMAN Nevertheless, ...
JERRY This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer. You know a radar detector is worth much more than that helmet. I think you're cheating him.
NEWMAN Don't say anything.
JERRY All right.
JERRY You know you're getting gypped over here.
KRAMER Really, Ah,
NEWMAN We had a deal. Are you reneging out of the deal? Are you reneging? That's a renege.
KRAMER Oh, stop saying 'reneging".
NEWMAN Well you're reneging.
KRAMER I, Okay, okay. I'm not reneging.
NEWMAN All right give it to me. let go ...
KRAMER You let go - come on ...
JERRY Gimme that - just gimme that. Here. Idiots!
NEWMAN Thanks buddy. So long he he ...
JERRY Does that thing work?
KRAMER Nah. At Monks.
JERRY ... I just got a postcard from Elaine?
GEORGE Really?
JERRY Yeah, they're in London now. They'll be back in a few weeks.
GEORGE I can't believe she got involved with a shrink.
GEORGE So, what's happening with the tv show? You come up with anything?
JERRY No, nothing.
GEORGE Why don't they have salsa on the table?
JERRY What do you need salsa for?
GEORGE Salsa is now the number one condiment in America.
JERRY You know why? Because people like to say "salsa." "Excuse me, do you have salsa?" "We need more salsa." "Where is the salsa? No salsa?"
GEORGE You know it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa. "I wanted seltzer, not salsa."
JERRY "Don't you know the difference between seltzer and salsa?? You have the seltezer after the salsa!"
GEORGE See, this should be a show. This is the show.
JERRY What?
GEORGE This. Just talking.
JERRY Yeah, right.
GEORGE I'm really serious. I think that's a good idea.
JERRY Just talking? Well what's the show about?
GEORGE It's about nothing.
JERRY No story?
GEORGE No forget the story.
JERRY You've got to have a story.
GEORGE Who says you gotta have a story? Remember when we were waiting for, for that table in that Chinese restaurant that time? That could be a tv show.
JERRY And who is on the show? Who are the characters?
GEORGE I could be a character.
JERRY You?
GEORGE Yeah. You could base a character on me.
JERRY So, on the show, there's a character named George Costanza?
GEORGE Yeah. There's something wrong with that? I'm a character. People are always saying to me, "You know you're a quite a character."
JERRY And who else is on the show?
GEORGE Elaine could be a character. Kramer..
JERRY Now he's a character. So everybody I know is a character on the show.
GEORGE Right.
JERRY And it's about nothing?
GEORGE Absolutely nothing.
JERRY So you're saying, I go in to NBC, and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing.
GEORGE We go into NBC.
JERRY "We"? Since when are you a writer?
GEORGE Writer. We're talking about a sit-com.
JERRY You want to go with me to NBC?
GEORGE Yeah. I think we really go something here.
JERRY What do we got?
GEORGE An idea.
JERRY What idea?
GEORGE An idea for the show.
JERRY I still don't know what the idea is.
GEORGE It's about nothing.
JERRY Right.
GEORGE Everybody's doing something, we'll do nothing.
JERRY So, we go into NBC, we tell them we've got an idea for a show about nothing.
GEORGE Exactly.
JERRY They say, "What's your show about?" I say, "Nothing."
GEORGE There you go.
JERRY I think you may have something there.
JERRY So, the show would be about my real life. And one of the characters would be based on you.
KRAMER No, I don't think so.
JERRY What do you mean you don't think so?
KRAMER I don't like it.
JERRY I don't understand. What don't you like about it?
KRAMER I don't like the idea of a character based on me.
JERRY Why not?
KRAMER well it just doesn't sit well.
JERRY You're my neighbor. There's got to be a character based on you.
KRAMER That's your problem, buddy.
JERRY I don't understand what the big deal is.
KRAMER Hey, I'll tell you what - you can do it on one condition.
JERRY Whatever you want.
KRAMER I get to play Kramer.
JERRY You can't play Kramer.
KRAMER I am Kramer.
JERRY But you can't act.
KRAMER Phew!
JERRY Okay, fine. We'll use Newman.
KRAMER Newman?
NEWMAN Use me for what?
JERRY Nothin' What do you want?
NEWMAN Well, you'll never guess what happened to me today. I was uh, driving home on the palisades parkway when I looked in the rear view mirror and what did I see? The fuzz. And it's funny because my new radar detector was on. I didn't hear a thing. Isn't that strange?
KRAMER Yeah. That's strange.
NEWMAN A radar detector, as I understand it, detects radar! With a series of beeps and flashing lights. But oddly, for some reason I didn't hear a thing except for the sound of a police siren.
KRAMER That's queer uh?
NEWMAN I want my helmet back! Give me back my helmet and you're going to pay for that ticket.
KRAMER Yeah, you better think again Mojumbo.
NEWMAN You gave me a defective detector. ... Jerry?
JERRY Buyer beware.
NEWMAN Are you going to give me back that helmet or not?
KRAMER No. We had a deal. There are no guarantees in life.
NEWMAN No, but there's karma, Kramer.
JERRY Karma Kramer?
NEWMAN And one more thing. I'm not coming to your party.
JERRY Salsa, seltzer. Hey, excuse me, you got any salsa? No, not selzer, salsa. What's the matter?
GEORGE Nothing.
JERRY You sure? You look a little pale.
GEORGE No, I'm fine. I'm good. I'm very good.
JERRY What, are you nervous?
GEORGE No, not nervous. I'm good, very good. I can't do this! Can't do this!
JERRY What?
GEORGE I can't do this! I can't do it. I have tried. I'm here. It's impossible.
JERRY This was your idea!
GEORGE What idea? I just said something. I didn't know you were going to listen to me.
JERRY Dont' worry about it. They're just tv executives.
GEORGE They're men with jobs, Jerry! They wear suits and ties. They're married, they have secretaries.
JERRY I told you not to come.
GEORGE I need some water. I gotta get some water.
JERRY They'll give us water in there.
GEORGE Really? That's pretty good.
JERRY Oh God, it's Joe Devola.
GEORGE Who?
JERRY This guy's a writer, he's a total nut. I think he goes to the same shrink as Elaine.
JERRY Oh God he saw me.
DEVOLA Hello Jerry.
JERRY Hey Joe! HOW YOU DOING?
DEVOLA You're under no obligation to shake my hand.
JERRY Oh, no, Just a custom. Uh, that's my friend George. You look good.
DEVOLA Why shouldn't I look good?
JERRY Oh, no reason. You're into karate right?
DEVOLA You want to hit me?
JERRY What are you doing here?
DEVOLA I dreopped a script off.
JERRY Ah, good for you.
JERRY Well, ...
DEVOLA You don't have to say anything.
JERRY No, Uh, hey I guess I'll see you Sunday night.
DEVOLA Why?
JERRY Kramer's party.
DEVOLA Kramer's ... having ... a ... party?
JERRY No, no, he's not having a party. He's doing something. I don't know what it is. It's nothing. He's not doing anything.
DEVOLA Gee, I thought Kramer and I were very close friends.
JERRY No, I'm sure you are. I'm sure you are very close friends. Very close.
JERRY Give my best to Hinckley.
GEORGE What was that?
JERRY I can't believe what I just did. I didn't know kramer didn't invite him. I better call Kramer, ...
RECEPTIONIST They're ready for you.
GEORGE Okay, okay. Look, you do all the talking, okay?
JERRY Relax. Who are they?
GEORGE Yeah, they're not better than me.
JERRY Course not.
GEORGE Who are they?
JERRY They're nobody.
GEORGE What about me?
JERRY What about you?
GEORGE Why them? Why not me?
JERRY Why not you?
GEORGE I'm as good as them.
JERRY Better.
GEORGE You really think so?
JERRY No.
STU The bit, the bit I really liked what were the parakeet flew into the mirror. Now that's funny.
GEORGE The parakeet in the mirror. That's a good one, Stu.
JERRY Yeah, it's one of my favorites.
RUSSELL What about you, George? Have you written anything we might know?
GEORGE Well, possibly. I wrote an off-Broadway show, "La Cocina." ..Actually, it was off-off-Broadway. It was a comedy about a Mexican chef.
JERRY Oh, it was very funny. There was one great scene with the chef - what was his name?
GEORGE Pepe.
JERRY Oh, Pepe. Yeah, Pepe. And, uh, he was making tamales.
SUSAN Oh, he actually cooked on the stage?
GEORGE No, no, he mimed it. That's what was so funny about it.
RUSSELL So, what have you two come up with?
JERRY Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways. But the basic idea is I will play myself-
GEORGE May I?
JERRY Go ahead.
GEORGE I think I can sum up the show for you with one word: NOTHING.
RUSSELL Nothing?
GEORGE Nothing.
RUSSELL What does that mean?
GEORGE The show is about nothing.
JERRY Well, it's not about nothing.
GEORGE No, it's about nothing.
JERRY Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something.
RECEPTIONIST Mr. Dalrymple, your niece is on the phone.
RUSSELL I'll call back.
GEORGE d-a-l-r-i-m-p-e-l?
RUSSELL Not even close.
GEORGE Is it with a "y"?
RUSSELL No.
SUSAN What's the premise?
JERRY ..Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and, as a comedian, living in New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, which is all true.
GEORGE Yeah, but nothing happens on the show. You see, it's just like life. You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read.. You eat, you read, You go shopping.
RUSSELL You read? You read on the show?
JERRY Well, I don't know about the reading.. We didn't discuss the reading.
RUSSELL All right, tell me, tell me about the stories. What kind of stories?
GEORGE Oh, no. No stories.
RUSSELL No stories? So, what is it?
GEORGE What'd you do today?
RUSSELL I got up and came to work.
GEORGE There's a show. That's a show.
RUSSELL How is that a show?
JERRY Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work.
GEORGE No, no, no. Nothing happens.
JERRY Well, something happens.
RUSSELL Well, why am I watching it?
GEORGE Because it's on tv.
RUSSELL Not yet.
GEORGE Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing, then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you something else, this is the show and we're not going to change it. Right?
JERRY How about this: I manage a circus..
JERRY I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What were you thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity? Where, where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get better.
GEORGE . . . I thought the woman was kind of cute.
JERRY Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman you're talking about?
GEORGE Yeah, I thought I might give her a call. I, I don't meet that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean, we've been introduced. She knows my name.
JERRY It's completely inappropriate!
GEORGE Why? Maybe she liked me. I, I mean she was looking right at me. You know, I think she was impressed. You know, we had good eye contact the whole meeting.
JERRY Oh, I forgot to call Kramer.
GEORGE Wait a minute let me call Susan.
JERRY No, no this is more important.
GEORGE She might be leaving to work any minute.
JERRY No, I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party.
GEORGE No.
ELAINE What is it?
DR._RESTON I was just thinking about this patient of mine.
ELAINE What?
DR._RESTON Just wondering if he's taking his medication.
ELAINE Well, come on we're on vacation.
JERRY Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how Devola is. He's all, ...
KRAMER Yeah
GEORGE It's George.
JERRY And so, uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party.
KRAMER Whoa, back up a second.
JERRY Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him.
KRAMER Why would you think I would invite him?
JERRY I just a ssumed, ...
KRAMER Assumed? Never assume anything. I don't want that nut in my house. You know he's on medication.
GEORGE Hello, oh, hello. You remember, ... Susan, from N B C.
JERRY Of course. How are you?
SUSAN Fine, it's good to see you.
GEORGE And this is Kramer.
SUSAN Hello.
GEORGE All right go ahead Susan, tell him.
JERRY Tell me what?
SUSAN Well, I,
JERRY Uh, sorry, Excuse me one second. Hello.
TELEPHONE Hi, would you be interested in switching over to TMI long distance service.
JERRY Oh, gee, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number and I'll call you later.
TELEPHONE Uh, I'm sorry we're not allowed to do that.
JERRY Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home.
TELEPHONE No.
JERRY Well now you know how I feel.
GEORGE Well, go ahead, tell him.
JERRY Kramer, are you drinking that milk?
KRAMER Yeah.
JERRY What's the expiration date on that?
KRAMER September third.
JERRY The third?
GEORGE and SUSAN: The third?
KRAMER Um, Uh, ugh, ...
SUSAN Noooo...
GEORGE I never should have brought her up there. Should have known better. Should have seen it coming. I didn't see it coming.
JERRY I think SHE saw it coming.
GEORGE You know she was behind the idea. She was going to champion the show. That's what I was bring her up there to tell you. And she liked me.
JERRY Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.
GEORGE What, are you crazy? It's a traumatic thing to be thrown up on.
JERRY Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia.
GEORGE Chamberlind, you could hold his head in nthe toilet, he'd still give you half of Europe.
JERRY What happened to you?
KRAMER Devola came after me.
JERRY What? Devola? See I told you this guy is crazy. I can't believe this. What happened?
KRAMER Can I have a coffee. ... What, you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know. I gota new strap. And I had it on you know, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. It knocks me down, I look up and it's Crazy Joe Devola. And he say's, "That's what I thin k of your party."
JERRY Boy,that is some kick.
KRAMER Well, yeah, Newman's helmet, it saved my life. Look at that.
JERRY Wow, Newman's helmet.
GEORGE Holly.
KRAMER I got bad news for you buddy. Devola says you're next.
JERRY Me, why?
KRAMER He doesn't like you.
JERRY What does he want from me? I didn't do anything. See this is all Elaine's fault. She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist. He probably can't get his medication. Now I got some nut after me.
KRAMER Pass the cream.
GEORGE Wait a second. . all right.
JERRY Hang on just let me pick up a paper.
MAN Excuse me. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?
GEORGE Yeah. No problem.
JERRY Let's go.
GEORGE Woah, I gotta watch this guy's bag.
JERRY For how long?
GEORGE I'm sure he'll be back in a second.
JERRY Come on.
GEORGE Excuse me sir. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?
MAN_2 Why? So I can stand here like an idiot not knowing if you'll ever come back?
GEORGE Where are you going?
JERRY I'm going to be this guy's friend.
JERRY New clothes?
GEORGE Yeah. I did some shopping. Some new clothes shopping. Can I borrow your menu?
JERRY Strange. For new pants, there's noticable wear on the buttocks of those chinos. Wait those are the clothes from the bag!
GEORGE The guy never came back.
JERRY He asked you to watch them not wear them.
GEORGE I'm still watching them.
JERRY You look like a tourist.
GEORGE All right, let me ask you something: When do you start to worry about ear hair?
JERRY When you hear like a soft russeling.
GEORGE It's like puberty that never stops. Ear puberty, nose puberty, knuckle puberty, you gotta be vigilent. Let me ask you this: Do you know where Walker Street is downtown? I've got a league meeting there.
JERRY Oh right, the new job, how is it?
GEORGE I love it. New office, new salary. I'm the new Wilhelm.
JERRY So who's the new you?
GEORGE They got a new intern from Francis Louis High. His name is Keith. He comes in Mondays after school.
JERRY Oh hi Alex.
ALEX I'm sorry I'm late. Have you ordered yet?
JERRY No.
ALEX I'll be right back.
GEORGE Where are you meeting these women? When they get off the bus at the port authority?
JERRY Right here, George. In here. Try opening this up. You'll find the biggest dating scene in the world.
GEORGE Thanks. Thanks a lot.
KRAMER Hey.
ELAINE Hey.
KRAMER Hi.
ELAINE Where's Jerry?
KRAMER Well he's in the shower. You want me to get him?
ELAINE No. No no. Actually I kind of need to speak to you.
KRAMER Well let's sit down.
ELAINE Kramer, ahem, remember that whole deal with you selling Peterman your stories for his book and then he gave them back to you?
KRAMER Vaguely.
ELAINE Well I was kind of, hehehe, short on material and I, um, I put them in the book anyway.
KRAMER You put my life's stories in his autobiography?
ELAINE Kramer listen, it is such a stupid book. It doesn't matter.
KRAMER Oh no. Sure. It matters. Wow. I've broken through, huh. I'm part of popular culture now. Listen I've got to thank Mr. Peterman.
ELAINE He's doing a book signing at Waldenbooks this afternoon.
KRAMER Waldenbooks? That's a major chain huh.
KRAMER He Jerry, I'm going to waldenbooks.
JERRY Get out! Get out! I don't want to live like this.
KRAMER All right, let's go.
ELAINE Mr. Lippman, how are you?
MR_LIPPMAN Well I'm not bad. Not bad.
ELAINE What are you doing here?
MR_LIPPMAN I work for Pundant Publishishing. This is our book.
ELAINE Oh.
MR_LIPPMAN If you can call it that. Why is it every half-wit and sitcom star has his own book out now?
KRAMER Hey buddy. Remember me?
MR_PETERMAN You're that gangly fellow we bought the stories from.
KRAMER Yeah, I'm just here to do my part. What's your name darling?
WOMAN Who are you?
KRAMER I'm the real Peterman.
MR_PETERMAN All right playtime's over.
KRAMER Relax man. There's enough juice here to keep us all fat and giggley.
WOMAN I can't believe somebody pulled the top off of this muffin.
ELAINE That was me. I'm sorry. I don't like the stumps.
MR_LIPPMAN So you just eat the tops.
ELAINE Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.
KRAMER I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're hurting my elbow.
MAN_1 Try looking up hayseed.
MAN_2 You wanna sightsee? Get on a bus.
MARY_ANNE Please don't think all New Yorkers are so rude.
GEORGE Well actually I'm...
MARY_ANNE I'm Mary Anne. I work for the New York Visitor's Center. Where are you visiting from?
GEORGE Little Rock, Arkensas.
MARY_ANNE Ooh.
JERRY Hmm. That looks new.
KRAMER So get this. Peterman has his henchmen forcefully eject me from the book signing like I'm some kind of a maniac.
JERRY Yeah that's too bad.
KRAMER What's the matter with you?
JERRY Nothing.
KRAMER No, no, no. Don't give me that. I know you. Something's wrong. What is it.
JERRY I did something stupid.
KRAMER What did you do?
JERRY Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew, Gone.
KRAMER Don't you know you're not supposed to poke around down there.
JERRY Well women do it.
KRAMER "Well women do it." I'll tell you what. I'll pick you up a sundress and a parasol and you can just sashey your pretty little self around the town square.
JERRY Well what am I going to tell Alex?
KRAMER Listen to me. You don't tell anybody about this. No one. You hear me?
JERRY Um hum.
KRAMER Hey, Jerry shaved his chest.
JERRY Hey!
KRAMER I forgot. Wait. Never mind.
ALEX How about the beach this weekend?
JERRY You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend. I mean it's hard enough...
ALEX All right. All right. Wow is that a Mexican Hairless? Oh, I love those. Ooh, Hairless. This is where it's at. It's so much smoother and cleaner.
JERRY Really?
ELAINE "Top of the Muffin to you!"?
MR._LIPPMAN Top of the muffin to you. Elaine!
ELAINE Mr Lippman?
JERRY So you're pretending to be a tourist?
GEORGE It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around here so it's okay if I'm stupid, and she knows I'm only in town visiting so there's no messy breakup
JERRY How do you explain your apartment?
GEORGE I got a hotel room.
JERRY you moved into a hotel?
GEORGE Well I don't know anyone here Jerry. Where else am I going to stay?
JERRY So get this: we're in the park today Alex goes wild for this hairless dog.
GEORGE So?
JERRY So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not another.
GEORGE Oh really. You tell her you shaved it?
JERRY Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest.
KRAMER Hey Jerry.
KRAMER I'm starting a Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Check it out. Hahaha.
GEORGE Reality tour?
JERRY The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is reality.
ELAINE This was my idea you stole my idea.
MR._LIPPMAN Elaine these ideas are all in the air. They're in the air.
ELAINE Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is my air and my idea.
MR._LIPPMAN You want a muffin or not?
ELAINE Peach.
MARY_ANNE So I notice you don't have much of an accent.
GEORGE Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation.
MARY_ANNE Look george, I'm really enjoying spending time with you but I'm not sure this is going to work out. At some point you're going back to your job at Tyler Chicken and your three-legged dog Willie.
GEORGE Willie. Yeah.
MARY_ANNE And I'm still going to be here.
GEORGE Well what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here?
MARY_ANNE George, no offense. But this city would eat you alive.
JERRY You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you all the time now.
GEORGE Eat me alive, huh? We'll see who can make it in this town.
JERRY What is it she think you can't do?
GEORGE Find a job. Get an apartment.
JERRY How did you do those things?
GEORGE Never mind. The're done. All I have to do now is redo them. You know if you take everything I've ever done in my entire life and condense it down into one day, it looks decent.
JERRY Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?
KRAMER Here you go, here you go, check it out.
JERRY "The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour". I'm confused.
KRAMER Peterman's book is big business. People want to know the stories behind the stories.
JERRY Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person's life.
KRAMER I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and desert.
GEORGE What's desert?
KRAMER Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman eats.
GEORGE He eats those?
KRAMER No. I eat those. I'm the real Peterman.
GEORGE I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography is not. Now, you Kramer are real.
KRAMER Talk to me.
GEORGE But your life is Peterman's. Now the bus tour, which is real, takes to places that, while they are real, they are not real in sense that they did not really happen to the real Peterman which is you.
KRAMER Understand?
JERRY Yeah. $37.50 for a Three Musketeers.
MR._LIPPMAN Elaine. I'm in over my head. Nobody likes my muffin tops.
ELAINE So? What do you want me to do about it?
MR._LIPPMAN You're the muffin top expert, tell me what I'm doing wrong.
ELAINE Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing, I believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. But, I saw you in that paper hat and that aprin...
ELAINE Deal. Here's your problem. You're making just the muffin tops. You've gotta make the whole muffin. Then you... Pop the top, toss the stump. Taste.
MR._LIPPMAN Ah. Mmmmm. Ah hah?
ELAINE Yeah.
MR._LIPPMAN So what do we with the bottoms?
ELAINE I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen.
MR._LIPPMAN That's a good idea.
ELAINE And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation point? Because, it's not "Top of the Muffin TO YOU!!!"
MR._LIPPMAN No. No. It is.
KRAMER Hey Jerry. What is this? Lady Gillette? What's going on?
JERRY What? Can't I get a moment's peace?
KRAMER What are you doing to yourself?
JERRY I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.
KRAMER You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to happen? Everytime you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and fuller and darker.
JERRY Oh that's an old wives tale.
KRAMER Is it? Look at this.
KRAMER Look at it! Look at it! And it's all me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard.
JERRY Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen to me.
KRAMER Won't it? Or is it already starting to happen?
ELAINE Wow. Look at this. We're cleaning up.
LIPPMAN Oh, Rubin, get me another tray of lowfat cranberry.
REBECCA Excuse me, I'm Rebecca Demore from the homeless shelter.
ELAINE Oh, hi.
REBECCA Are you the ones leaveing the muffing pieces behind our shelter?
ELAINE You been enjoying them?
REBECCA They're just stumps.
ELAINE Well they're perfectly edible.
REBECCA Oh, so you just assume that the homeless will eat them, they'll eat anything?
MR._LIPPMAN No no, we just thought...
REBECCA I know what you thought. They don't have homes, they don't have jobs, what do they need the top of a muffin for? They're lucky to get the stumps.
ELAINE If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have to eat them.
REBECCA The homeless don't like them.
ELAINE Fine.
REBECCA We've never gotten so many complaints. Every two minutes, "Where is the top of this muffin? Who ate the rest of this?"
ELAINE We were just trying to help.
REBECCA Why don't you just drop off some chicken skins and lobster shells.
ELAINE I think I might.
MARY_ANNE I can't believe you found something so quickly. How much you pay?
GEORGE $2300.
MARY_ANNE Ouch. A month?
GEORGE Yeah.
MARY_ANNE Well, guess that's all right for now, but if you say here for more than a few months, you're a real sucker.
GEORGE Yeah, well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too. Wait till you see the plum job that I landed.
MARY_ANNE Yeah. We should let this place air out anyway. It smells like the last tenant had monkeys or something.
KRAMER Comming up on the right, if you glance up you can just make out my bedroom window. It's the one that's covered in chicken wire.
WOMAN Hey if you're the real Peterman, who come you're wearing those ratty clothes? The're not very romantic.
KRAMER Well that's your opinion.
MAN_1 Can I have another Three Musketeers? They're rather small.
KRAMER Forget it. Okay Newman's postal route is around here somewhere.
MAN_2 Who's Newman?
MAN_3 Who cares.
MAN_4 Hey fake Peterman, let me off. I'm nautious.
MAN_1 Can I have his candy bar?
KRAMER Ahh. Everyone just settle down. We have three hours left on this thing, and I can't drive and argue with you rubes all at the same time. Okay. Lomez's place of worship is right on the right here.
JERRY Why do I have to go on the tour?
KRAMER Jerry you're a minor celebrity. If you go on this thing, it could create a minor stir. Bring that girlfriend of your and I'll only charge to 60 bucks.
JERRY Hey, how's business?
ELAINE Ooh, I've got stump troubles. The Sanitation Department won't get rid of them all, I can't get a truck to haul this stuff until next week. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a mountain of stumps.
KRAMER All right, I've got to hose the puke off the floor of the bus.
ELAINE Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? You've got a bus?
KRAMER Yeah.
ELAINE You got any room on that thing?
KRAMER Yeah there are a few seats still available.
ELAINE Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? I'll make it worth your while.
KRAMER Well, if they don't mind sitting in the back.
ELAINE No they don't.
KRAMER Are they war veterans?
MARY_ANNE Wow this is your office.
MR._STEINBRENNER Woah. Hello. Sorry George, didn't know you got a girl in here. Give me a signal on the doornob like a necktie or a sock or something. Come on George, help me out.
MARY_ANNE Mr. Steinbrenner, I would like to thank you for taking a chance on a hen supervisor at Tyler Chicken like our boy George here.
MR._STEINBRENNER Hen supervisor from Tyler Chicken?
GEORGE Yes. Very nice to have had her to mention...
MR._STEINBRENNER Wait a minute George.
GEORGE Be right with you. Look Mr. Steinbrenner.
MR._STEINBRENNER Moonlighting for Tyler Chicken. Pretty impressive George. Days with the New York Yankees and nights in Arkensas with a top flight bird outlet. And a hen supervisor to boot. I am blown. Bloooown away. Blown George. Bloooooooooooooooooooown.
ALEX You know when you make a pizza bagel, you really shouldn't use cinnimon rasin.
JERRY You also shouldn't use a donut.
KRAMER All right ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Peterman Reality Tour...
TAPE_PLAYER Turn music off.
JERRY Can we just go?
KRAMER And go we will.
MAN What is this? A piece of pound cake?
KRAMER We have a bonus reality stop today. We will be hauling muffin stumps to the local repository.
MAN_2 We're going to a garbage dump?
KRAMER And we're off.
JERRY You know I never though he would be able to recreate the experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close.
MR._STEINBRENNER John Tyler? George Steinbreener here. I want to talk about George Castanza. I understand he's been dividing his time between us and you. I cannot have that.
JOHN_TYLER Well I don't know who he is but if you want him that bad I'm not giving him up that easily.
MR._STEINBRENNER Oh is that so. Playing a little hardball huh Jonnyboy?
JOHN_TYLER How about this. You give me Castanza, I convert your concessions to all chicken no charge. Instead of hot dogs, chicken dogs. Instead of pretzels, chicken twists. Instead of beer, alcoholic chicken.
MR._STEINBRENNER How do you make that alcoholic chicken?
JOHN_TYLER Let if ferment, just like everything else.
MR._STEINBRENNER That stuff sounds great. All right. I'll have Costanza on the next bus.
MAN Hey hey hey hey hey. Where do you think you're going?
KRAMER I was going to dump this.
MAN It doesn't look like garbage.
KRAMER Well it's muffin stumps
MAN Where are the muffin tops?
KRAMER This is a garbage dump. Just let me dump it.
MAN Can't do it.
KRAMER Is this a joke?
MAN That's what I'd like to know about it.
ALEX You have a pretty heavy beard, don't you?
JERRY What's that?
ALEX Well look it's almost time for you to shave again.
JERRY Oh. Yeah.
KRAMER Well maybe I will take it up with Consumer Affairs.
MAN Where are we going?
KRAMER I don't know. Uh, no more questions.
WAITRESS So, the New York Yankees traded you for a bunch of Tyler chicken.
GEORGE Dogs, twists, a kind of fermented chicken drink.
MAN Hey, aren't you the guy I asked to watch my clothes?
GEORGE What clothes?
MAN These clothes. The ones you're wearing.
JERRY Kramer how much longer? My chest hair is comming back and it's itching me like crazy. I can't let her see me scratch it.
KRAMER Don't worry. I've got a good feeling about this dump.
JERRY I'm telling you man, I'm losing it.
JERRY I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with that dog.
KRAMER I don't know where the tops are.
KRAMER Jerry what's the matter?
JERRY Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good.
BARTENDER Hey, you looking for George?
MARY_ANNE Yeah.
BARTENDER He's been in the bathroom awhile. You might want to check on him.
GEORGE Jerry you gotta bring me some clothes down here. I lost my job with the Yankees. I'm standing in the men's room on 43rd street in my underpants.
MARY_ANNE I told you this city would eat you alive.
MR._LIPPMAN What is this guy again?
ELAINE They call him a Cleaner. He makes problems go away.
NEWMAN Hello Elaine. Where are they?
ELAINE In the back.
NEWMAN All right, I'm going to need a clean 8 ounce glass.
MR._LIPPMAN What is going on here?
NEWMAN If I'm curt, then I appologize. But as I understand it, we have a situation here and time is of the essence.
JERRY I like the names they have for cars. Like, no baron has ever owned a LeBaron. Or the Ford LTD. "LTD." Limited. It's a "limited" edition...what did they make, fifty million of those? "Yes, it's 'limited' to the number we can sell." Or when they try and mangle a positive word into a car name, you know how they'll do that? The "Integra." Oh, integrity? No, Integra. The "Supra." Or the "Impreza." Yeah? Well, I hope it's not a "lemona"...or you'll be hearing from my "lawya."
CAR_SALESMAN George, are you sure I can't show you any other cars?
GEORGE I don't think so, Vic. I've done my homework. '89 Volvo, that's the car for me, it's the one I want.
SALESMAN I got a LeBaron convertible right here.
GEORGE N.I. Not interested.
SALESMAN It's got a few more miles on it, but the previous owner was John Voight.
GEORGE Jon Voight?
JERRY Okay, Tim. You're welcome.
ELAINE Was that Tim Whatley?
JERRY Yes, it was. He wanted your address - you, my friend, are going to be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party. You know, he's got that great apartment on 77th street, and they overlook where they inflate all those huge balloons for the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade?
ELAINE I have always had a big crush on Tim Whatley. Why can't he ask me out?
JERRY Oh, he's a dentist. You don't want to go out with a dentist.
ELAINE Why?
JERRY He'll always be criticizing your brushing technique, it'll drive you crazy. Away from the gums...
JERRY Uh - new car!
ELAINE Ohhh! Mark's Michelle is a dog.
JERRY Hey! Did you get the Volvo?
GEORGE No, I decided to go with an '89 LeBaron.
ELAINE A LeBaron?
JERRY I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car.
GEORGE What Consumer? I'm the consumer.
JERRY Alright. Seems like...a strange choice.
GEORGE Well, maybe so...but it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight.
ELAINE Jon Voight? The actor?
GEORGE That's right. He just happened to be the previous owner of the vehicle.
JERRY You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight?
GEORGE No, no...
JERRY I think yes, yes. You like the idea of telling people you're driving Jon Voight's car.
GEORGE Alright, maybe I do. So what.
ELAINE I've never even seen him in a car. I mean, look at his movies. No cars. Deliverance - canoe. Midnight Cowboy - boots. Runaway Train...runaway train.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER Jerry, you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block? Well, if they don't get some business, they're gonna have to shut down and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores.
ELAINE I like coffee.
GEORGE I like "cookies."
KRAMER Yeah, of course you do. And do you know why? Because you're a bunch of yuppies. It's your go-go corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these Mom and Pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood.
GEORGE Well, what's so great about a Mom and Pop store? Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there.
KRAMER Hey, Bogambo - they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years. Now, come on, Jerry. You've gotta have a pair of shoes in need of a cobblin.'
JERRY I really don't wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled.
KRAMER Well, what about sneakers? You know, they'll clean 'em. They do complete detailing.
JERRY Alright, take 'em.
KRAMER Yeah-yah.
POP Kramer, without you, we'd be out of business.
KRAMER Well you know, these sneakers, they belong to my neighbor, Jerry Seinfeld? The comedian.
MOM So many sneakers!
KRAMER Well, he's got a Peter Pan complex.
POP They'll be ready a week from Thursday.
KRAMER Oh, well, no rush. Uh oh.
MOM What's the matter?
KRAMER Oh, I keep getting these nosebleeds.
MOM Oh, lie down, and put your head back.
KRAMER Yeah. Hey, what's with your ceiling?
POP What?
KRAMER Well, you got wires sticking out every which way. That looks dangerous, you should call the electrician.
POP You know, in the 48 years we've been here, I don't think we've ever called an electrician.
KRAMER Yeah well, you should. This place could blow any minute.
MR._PITT Elaine?
ELAINE Yes, Mr. Pitt?
MR._PITT Have you gotten all the salt off those pretzels yet?
ELAINE No, I'm still working on it.
MR._PITT What in blazes are you listening to?
ELAINE Artie Shaw. "Honeysuckle Jump."
DJ_ON_RADIO That was Artie Shaw, "Honeysuckle Jump."
MR._PITT Elaine! How did you know that?
ELAINE Oh, my father used have a huge collection of big band records.
DJ_ON_RADIO Congratulations to our listener Wayne Hopper for identifying it. And by doing so, he becomes our seventh person to land the WFBB-sponsored Woody Woodpecker balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. There are only three spots left. We're going to take a little break now; when we come back, you'll have three more chances to win a spot holding a rope under Woody Woodpecker.
MR._PITT Could you identify the next song? Could you? Could you?
ELAINE Mr. Pitt, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody Woodpecker balloon?
MR._PITT My father was a stern man. He forbad us to participate in any activities that he thought were associated with the common man. The Thanksgiving Day Parade was first on the list.
ELAINE Oh. Alright, I'll do the best I can.
DJ_ON_RADIO Alright, here we go for the next spot under the balloon. If you know the name of this song, call 555-BAND.
MR._PITT Well, Elaine? Do you know it? What song is it?
ELAINE Will you shut up? I can't hear!
MR._PITT I'm sorry!
ELAINE Oh! I've got it! It's "Next Stop Pottersville"!
MR._PITT Goody! Yes! Yes! Yes! Next Stop Pottersville, Next Stop Pottersville! You are a genius!
GEORGE You are gonna love this car. Even if you don't like Jon Voight.
JERRY I like Jon Voight. Just seems like kind've a strange reason to buy a car, because he might have driven it.
GEORGE What do you mean "might"? You don't think he really owned this car?
JERRY I don't know.
GEORGE Well, why would the guy make up something like that? Of all the names he could pick, why settle on Jon Voight?
JERRY Don't you see, that's the genius of it. If he had said Liam Neeson, you'd know he's making it up.
GEORGE Neeson? How are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight? Jerry, we're talking about Joe Buck. If you can play Joe Buck, Oskar Schindler's a cake walk.
JERRY Oh, look at this, I stepped in gum.
GEORGE Whoa, whoa, you're not getting in my car with gummy shoes.
JERRY Alright, I'll change my shoes.
GEORGE Liam Neeson. You know, he's not American.
JERRY Let me get a clean pair.
GEORGE Everybody's talkin' at me...I can't hear a word they're sayin'...just drivin' around in Jon Voight's car...
JERRY Kramer! Hey! Where's all my sneakers?
KRAMER You said take 'em.
JERRY Not all of 'em!
KRAMER Well, obviously there was a miscommunication.
JERRY Obviously. So what am I supposed to wear?
KRAMER Jerry, I left you a pair right here... C'mon. There, put on those boots.
JERRY I can't wear these!
KRAMER Well, why not?
JERRY They're uncomfortable.
KRAMER C'mon here, try 'em on.
GEORGE Where did you get those?
JERRY I worked a club in Dallas one time and they couldn't afford to pay me so they gave me these. Oh, I can't wear these! They look ridiculous!
KRAMER Ah, you look like a cowboy! Huh?
JERRY But I don't wanna be a cowboy!
KRAMER Oh, stop it. You know that friend of yours, Tim the dentist? I got an invitation to his Thanksgiving Eve party.
GEORGE Yeah, I got one too.
KRAMER Yeah?
JERRY Oh yeah? Huh.
GEORGE What?
JERRY No, nothing.
GEORGE No, what is it?
JERRY No, it's just that I, uh...didn't get one.
GEORGE You didn't get one?
JERRY Ah, but he called me up and he asked for yours and Elaine's addresses, I'm sure that means I'm invited.
KRAMER Not necessarily.
JERRY Hey, why would you call someone up and ask them for two addresses if you're not invited to the party?
GEORGE That's the genius of it.
JERRY I'm callin' Elaine. See if she can find out anything from Tim Whatley.
GEORGE Hey. I got Jon Voight's LeBaron.
KRAMER Boss!
POP Four thousand dollars? We can't afford that!
ELECTRICIAN Well I'm afraid you're gonna have to do something about it, because it's in violation of the building code. Otherwise, they're gonna close you up.
POP But what if we can't pay for it?
ELECTRICIAN Then I have to report you. Otherwise, I lose my license. Sorry.
POP 48 years, Mom! And now we have to close! All because of that idiot and his bloody nose!
KRAMER Afternoon, Mom! Afternoon, Pop. You know you got a crack in the sidewalk out there? Now, you oughta get that fixed.
GEORGE So?
JERRY C'mon, put the top up, it's November!
GEORGE I feel alive, Jerry.
JERRY Let's check out the glove box. Ah. Pencil.
GEORGE Hey...you don't think...sure, that's Jon Voight's pencil!
JERRY With Jon Voight's teeth marks. Owner's manual...you know what? This car was owned by Jon Voight.
GEORGE Ah! See? I told ya.
JERRY Except Jon is spelled with an H. J-O-H-N.
GEORGE So?
JERRY Doesn't Jon Voight spell his name J-O-N?
GEORGE So, what are you saying?
JERRY Nothing. I'm sure "Jon" probably mispelled his own name. I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G...and an I!
GEORGE Get out of the car!
JERRY What?
GEORGE That's right, you heard me. Get out! You are ruining this whole experience for me!
JERRY Oh, look! There's Gregory Peck's bicycle!
GEORGE Get out!
JERRY And Barbara Mandrell's skateboard!
GEORGE Get out!!
TOUGH_GUY Hey, cowboy. Where's your horse? Yeah, you better run!
GEORGE Did they take anything?
JERRY No, they didn't even touch me. I tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots.
GEORGE Anyway, again, I'm sorry about throwing you out of the car.
JERRY You really seemed to enjoy it.
GEORGE It was kinda fun. You know, maybe his name really is J-O-H-N, but he changed it to J-O-N for show business. Well, you know, J-O-N is a lot zippier.
JERRY Yeah, that's possible.
GEORGE How would you find out something like that...wait a minute, what am I thinking? I've got the entire Yankee organization at my disposal.
JERRY He'll dispose of it.
GEORGE Heh, that's right. See ya later.
ELAINE So Jerome, I did a little snooping around for you.
JERRY Ah! What'd you find out, Lois?
ELAINE Well, I talked to Tim Whatley...
JERRY Yeah...
ELAINE And I asked him, "Should Jerry bring anything?"
JERRY So...?
ELAINE Mmmm...and he said, "Why would Jerry bring anything?"
JERRY Alright, but let me ask you this question.
ELAINE What?
JERRY Which word did he emphasize? Did he say, "Why would Jerry bring anything?" or, "Why would Jerry bring anything?" You emphasize "Jerry" or "bring."
ELAINE I think he emphasized "would."
JERRY You know what? The hell with this party, I don't even want to go to begin with.
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey, so where's my sneakers?
KRAMER That's what I wanna know.
JERRY What do you mean?
KRAMER Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning, but when I went by the store on my way home? The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop - vrooop - vanished.
JERRY So all my sneakers are gone?
KRAMER I'm afraid so. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been asking around - they didn't even have any kids.
JERRY Mom and Pop aren't even a Mom and Pop?!
KRAMER It was all an act, Jerry. They conned us, and they scored, big time.
ELAINE So. Mom and Pop's plan was to move into the neighborhood...establish trust...for 48 years. And then, run off with Jerry's sneakers.
KRAMER Apparently.
ELAINE Alright, that's enough of this.
JERRY Where ya goin'?
ELAINE I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass for the parade.
JERRY Why does he want to hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day Parade?
ELAINE He finds his laugh "intoxicating."
MR._MORGAN So George, what kind of promotional events are we talking about?
GEORGE Well, I think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? Like, uh...Joe Pepitone Day. Or, uh...Jon Voight Day.
MR._MORGAN Jon Voight? The actor? Uh, I make a motion that we have no more of these meetings that have been initiated by George Costanza.
GEORGE I suppose if I had suggested Liam Neeson Day, you'd all be patting me on the back.
CONTEST_WINNER I guessed Stan Herman's "Boomtown Blues." What'd you guess?
ELAINE Um, it was, uh..."Next Stop Pottersville." Uh, do you know when they're giving out the passes?
CONTEST_WINNER After the music.
KRAMER Oh. Oh man.
VOIGHT Taxi! Taxi.
KRAMER Hey! Jon Voight! Jon Voight! Hey, listen, can I ask you something? Listen, listen...
JERRY No Jon Voight Day, huh?
GEORGE No. Now I'll always have this doubt about the car. What, your jaw still hurts?
JERRY Yeah, it's all swollen. I think I may have chipped a tooth when I fell yesterday.
GEORGE You should have somebody take a look at that.
JERRY I'm calling dentists all day here, there's nobody working the day before Thanksgiving.
GEORGE You going to the party?
JERRY No, I don't know if I'm invited.
GEORGE Well, there's going to be a lot of dentists there.
JERRY Yeah, you're right.
GEORGE You don't want to suffer with this all weekend.
JERRY Yeah, I gotta see a dentist, this is killin' me. Well, I'll take a chance. We'll go together.
GEORGE Maybe I'll just meet you there.
JERRY You don't want to go with me?
GEORGE Jerry, for all I know this guy went out of his way to not invite you. How am I gonna feel if I show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder?
JERRY The way I feel when I go places with you? Hey, so'd you find my sneakers yet?
KRAMER No. But I did run into somebody you might be interested in, a Mr. Jon Voight, the actor?
GEORGE Jon Voight! Are you kiddin' me? Did you talk to him?
KRAMER Well, he was a little standoffish.
GEORGE What, you didn't ask him about the car?
KRAMER No, I couldn't, his cab pulled away. But he did, however, make an impression on me. Look.
JERRY What?
KRAMER His tooth marks. He bit me.
GEORGE Jon Voight bit you?
JERRY Well, what is he, a vampire?
KRAMER No, it's justifiable. He thought I was going for his wallet.
GEORGE He left perfect imprints.
KRAMER That he did. Now, you got that pencil with the bite marks on it? We get a trained eye to match 'em up, and we'll see whether or not you're driving Jon Voight's car!
JERRY Oh, please.
GEORGE Wait a minute, wait, it's not that stupid.
JERRY No, it's stupid.
GEORGE Why? Why isn't it possible? I mean, they're both bite marks.
JERRY So you're gonna show up at that party with a chewed-up pencil and Kramer's gnarled arm.
GEORGE It's worth a shot.
JERRY So, Kramer, you wanna go to the party together?
KRAMER Jerry, look, come on, I'm an invited guest. I can't be aiding and abetting some...party-crasher.
JERRY Excuse me, uh...dentist? You a dentist? Dentist? Are you a dentist?
GEORGE These are the balloons? Big deal, all I see is Woody Woodpecker.
KRAMER You got a problem with Woody Woodpecker?
GEORGE Yeah, what is he? Some sort of an instigator?
KRAMER That's right. He's a troublemaker.
JERRY Hey, Elaine. Did you get my message?
ELAINE What? I can't hear a word you're saying. I was stuck at the Dixieland Deli all day. My head is still ringing. Where's Tim?
JERRY What is that, the Empire State Building?
ELAINE What? I can't hear you.
JERRY Elaine, would you marry me?
ELAINE I told you, I can't hear a word.
JERRY Alright. Forget it.
GEORGE Hey, Tim.
TIM Hey, George. Kramer, how ya doin.'
GEORGE Watch the arm! Tim, listen, we don't want to bother you, we know you're busy here.
TIM No, it's no problem, what is it?
GEORGE Let me show you something, take a look at this...
GUY Alright Tim, I'm gonna get goin.'
TIM Alright, let me take down your number. Is that Jerry Seinfeld?
KRAMER He didn't come with us.
GEORGE Uh, Tim, the pencil...
TIM Jerry.
JERRY Hey, Tim.
TIM Jerry. I didn't think you'd show.
JERRY Did you say, "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show" or, "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show"?
TIM Elaine! Hi!
ELAINE Tim.
TIM Well. I'm really glad you came.
ELAINE What?
TIM Really glad you came.
ELAINE Uh huh.
TIM Listen, Elaine, I've been wanting to ask you...would you like to go out with me New Years Eve? Thanks.
ELAINE What? What?
GEORGE Let me ask you something. Could you tell if teeth marks on someone's arm matched teeth marks on a pencil?
DENTIST It's possible.
GEORGE Roll up your sleeve.
DENTIST Somebody bit you?
KRAMER Not just someone. Jon Voight.
DENTIST Jon Voight bit you? The pencil! Hey, hey! Get the pencil out of your mouth, you're destroying Jon Voight's teeth marks!
TIM That's John Voight's pencil?
GEORGE That's right. I got his whole car downstairs.
TIM Are you the one who bought his LeBaron convertible?
GEORGE Yes! Yes, I'm the one! Hey! So, you know Jon Voight!
TIM Yes! Yes, I went to dental school with him.
GEORGE Jon Voight, the actor?
TIM No. The periodontist.
DENTIST Can't this wait until Monday? Come by my office.
JERRY Just a quick peek. I'm in agony.
DENTIST Alright. Sit down.
JERRY It's this one here in the back.
KRAMER Oh! You popped Woody Woodpecker!
TIM Hey, who invited you, anyway? You're a troublemaker!
ANNOUNCER_ON_TV Hey, it looks like Woody Woodpecker is running out of air. In fact, he's collapsing.
KRAMER Those kids look pretty disappointed.
JERRY Especially that big kid up in the front. How old is he? Hello?
GUY_ON_PHONE Hello, is this Jerry Seinfeld?
JERRY Yes it is.
GUY_ON_PHONE You don't know me, but a really strange thing happened. I was at a garage sale, and this old couple sold me a used pair of sneakers they claimed belonged to Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian.
JERRY Can I have the address of that garage sale? Okay, thank you very much. I found Mom and Pop, they're sellin' my sneakers!
KRAMER Where are they?
JERRY Parsippany, New Jersey.
KRAMER Let's go!
JERRY My car's in the shop.
KRAMER Well, how are we getting to Parsippany?
KRAMER Uh. Jerry. These nosebleeds are starting again.
JERRY Maybe we should get you to a hospital.
KRAMER Hey, I ain't goin' to no Bellevue! Look at me, I'm fallin' apart here.
GEORGE So, Elaine, are you going to sleep with me or what?!
ELAINE George, I just got off a twenty-three hour plane ride. I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought.
GEORGE Fine. I'll ask you again when you're rested.
JERRY Oh, I'm sure she'll come around.
GEORGE Yeah, I hope so. For your sake!
JERRY I said I was sorry.
GEORGE You can stuff you sorries in a sack, mister!
JERRY Would you please stop saying that?!
KRAMER What's up with you two?
GEORGE I don't want to talk about it.
KRAMER So how was the big trip?
JERRY I don't want to talk about it!
KRAMER Well, what happened to your nose?
ELAINE I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it!
KRAMER Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the wedding? Was the bride radiant?
ELAINE She.. was.
JERRY 'Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom.
KRAMER Ooohh.. That sounds juicy. Listen, I gotta go to the bathroom, but I want to hear all about it.
GEORGE You know, I didn't go to the bathroom the entire time we were in India.
JERRY I can't believe we went all the way to India for a wedding!
SUE_ELLEN That's it! The wedding's off.
PINTER What? But, Sue Ellen-
SUE_ELLEN Elaine, you were my maid of honor and you slept with MY Pinter?!
ELAINE No, no, no! It was years ago - before you met him. And, and I got to tell you.. it was very mechanical.
SUE_ELLEN I have never been so humiliated!
ELAINE Idiots! This is all your fault!
GEORGE Not me! Him! His fault! He betrayed me!
JERRY George, I'm sorry..
GEORGE You can stuff your sorries in a sack, Mister!
JERRY I don't know what that means.
GEORGE Alright, Nina, you have to decide right now. Jerry or me?
NINA Alright.. Neither.
GEORGE What?! Well, what are you doing here?
NINA A free trip to India. And by the way, you can take off those boots. Everyone knows you're five' six.
GEORGE Five' eight! Five' seven!
ELAINE See? See the way they are?! We're - we're still best friends, right?
SUE_ELLEN No. And take that stupid thing out of your nose!
JERRY That's got to hurt, I don't care where you're from!
GEORGE What time is our flight back? I got to go to the bathroom.
ELAINE Hey.
JERRY Hey.
ELAINE What happened last night?
JERRY Oh, you were pretty loaded.
ELAINE I know. I woke up with this.
JERRY Oh. Hello, Tetanus.
NINA George, I've used the bathroom. It's fine.
GEORGE No, no, no, no. I can walk it off. It's a hundred and twenty degrees in here.. I'll sweat it out.
ELAINE Hey. Are those Timberlands painted black?
GEORGE Is your nose pierced?
ELAINE I should..
GEORGE Yeah. Sit down there. Hello, Jerry. I believe you know Nina.
JERRY George, we need to talk.
GEORGE I think you've done a lot more than talk! You betrayed me!
JERRY Alright, I admit it. I slept with Nina, but that's all.
GEORGE "That's all"?! That's everything! I don't know what all the rest of it is for anyway!
JERRY I'm really sorry.
GEORGE You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister!
JERRY Where'd you get that one?
GEORGE It's an expression.
ELAINE Hey! Shhhhh!
GEORGE Look, we are gonna settle this right now! I demand reparations! I should get to sleep with Elaine. That's the only way to punish you!
JERRY That doesn't punish me. It punishes Elaine! And cruelly, I might add.
GEORGE Funny guy!
ELAINE Hey! Monkeys! Knock it off. My best friend is trying to get married up here!
GEORGE Elaine, you have to sleep with me.
ELAINE I'm not gonna sleep with you.
GEORGE Reparations!
ELAINE Would you grow up, George?! What is the difference? Nina slept with him, he slept with me, I slept with Pinter. Nobody cares! It's all ancient history.
GEORGE You slept with the groom?!
KRAMER Oh, thank you, FDR!
KRAMER Alright, FDR.. This wish is for all the marbles. You win, you get your wish - I drop dead. I win, I don't drop dead, and I get one-hundred percent anti-drop-dead protection. Forever.
FDR Alright.
KRAMER Oh, man! Well, then, come on. There's got to be something that'll change your mind, FDR. Something.." What, you want my kidney? Mama!..
ELAINE George knows that you slept with Nina. That's why he was acting so weird.
JERRY How did he find out?
ELAINE He schnapped me.
JERRY You know you're not supposed to drink whil you're keeping a secret! Is there anything else?
ELAINE I can't tell you.
JERRY Here, drink this.
ELAINE Okay. I slept with the groom.
JERRY Pinter?
ELAINE He used to be called Peter.
JERRY So? Who cares about that?
ELAINE Sue Ellen! If she knew, she'd call off the whole wedding.
JERRY Oh, nobody's calling off any weddings. Alright, it's time to go. Come on.. Up.
ELAINE Do you know what 'Jerry' is in Indian?
JERRY No, what?
ELAINE Jugdish.
JERRY Yes, jugdish.
ELAINE Hey, what if I got my nose pierced? That would be pretty freaky.. Oooohhhhaaa!
JERRY Yes, I think it's a fine idea. Well, good night.
ELAINE G'night, Jugdish.
JERRY Bless you.
ELAINE Thank you..
KRAMER Well, guess what, FDR? I made a wish on a shooting star last night, and I wished against your wish.
FDR That's funny. As it happens, I saw the same shooting star and double-wished you to drop dead. Here's your change.
KRAMER Alright, I'm triple-wishing! Yep!
FDR Then I'm quadruple-wishing!
KRAMER Alright.. How do you like this? Ya!
FDR I like it a lot. Ow!
KRAMER Ah!
FDR Oh!
ELAINE Oh, God, it's so hot! What's that smell?
JERRY I think it's the stench of death.
NINA George, you've been wearing those boots since I met you. You're not gonna wear them to the wedding, are you?
GEORGE No.. I'm gonna wear black shoes.
ELAINE Oh boy. There's Sue Ellen. She didn't want me at this wedding, but here I am with a buch of my idiot friends!
JERRY This is gonna be great!
SUE_ELLEN Elaine? Oh! Oh, I am so happy to see you!
ELAINE You are?
SUE_ELLEN Well, of course! No one else was even willing to come to India. I mean, not even Pinter's parents - and they're Indian.
ELAINE Come on, Sue Ellen. You don't wear a bra, you're tall.. we hate each other!
SUE_ELLEN Elaine, I know. I know we've had our problems, but.. I want you to be my maid of honor - and my best friend.
ELAINE Huh.. alright. I guess.
SUE_ELLEN Uh, this is my fiance, Pinter. Say hello.
PINTER Hello.
ELAINE Peter?
SUE_ELLEN Uh, no. It's Pinter. Does anyone want to use the bathroom?
GEORGE Oh, no. No. We're good. Let's get goin'. Alright. Watch it, funny man.
JERRY Elaine, have you noticed George was acting strage the whole flight?
ELAINE No. What? Like what? What? Strange.. No. I..
JERRY Uh-huh. Hey, look what they had on the plane. Schnapps.
ELAINE Ooohh.
KRAMER Come on.. Come on. Yes! There's one! I wish I don't drop dead!!
MAN Hey, shut up up there!
KRAMER You shut up!
MAN Aw, drop dead!
GEORGE Hello, friend. Enjoying the flight?
JERRY Coach to India - The only way to go.
GEORGE Good one. Very funny. You're very funny, Jerry. That's what I always tell people. Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!
JERRY You all right?
GEORGE Of course I'm all right. I'm here with my girl. Nina. And what better way to pass the time than gabbing with my best friend.. with whom there are no secrets. Like this. Since the fourth grade.
JERRY Hey, didn't I beat you up in the fourth grade?
GEORGE Funny guy! Right here!
NINA By the way, you never said anything to George about Jerry and me, did ya?
ELAINE Oh please.. It's in the vault.
GEORGE Ho, ho! Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!
ELAINE Watch this. Oh.. God..
GEORGE So, Jerry and Nina, huh?
ELAINE Oh, Mmm.. I'm not gonna tell you any more things..
GEORGE But you already told me everything.
ELAINE Okey-dokey.
KRAMER I mean, we had a deal, Newman. And you were supposed to give my your birthday wish. And now you've wated it!
NEWMAN Did I?
WOMAN Newman, I'm bored.
NEWMAN Aww..
KRAMER Does your girlfriend have to be here?
NEWMAN Does yours?
JERRY I'm just hanging out in this hell-hole because of George.
KRAMER Alright, come on, Newman. Now you gotta help me! What am I gonna do about FDR?
WOMAN Why don't you just make another wish?
KRAMER And how am I gonna do that, Toots?
WOMAN What about a shooting star?
KRAMER That's perfect..
NEWMAN Beauty.. and brains.
JERRY Oh, come on. You know he's a postman, don't ya?
GEORGE Hey.
ELAINE Here. You're going to India with us tomarrow.
GEORGE For how long?
ELAINE Three days.
GEORGE Great. Jerry, I gotta tell you, I had the best time with that Nina last night. I - I think I'm in love with her already. You are a great friend. A great, great friend.
JERRY Hey, Kramer, what are you doing? You want to borrow something? You want to eat something? Come on in!
KRAMER Nah.
ELAINE You want to go to India?
KRAMER I can't. I'm gonna drop dead.
GEORGE Great! Nina could go, huh? Jerry, this is great. You and Elaine. Me and Nina..
JERRY Hey, Kramer, wait up. I'll go with you.
KRAMER I'm goin' to Newman's!
JERRY Great, I love Newman!
GEORGE Jerry seem a little weird when I mentioned Nina?
ELAINE Nina? Nina? No. Psshhh.. Not weird. No. Nina.
GEORGE Why do you keep saying Nina?
ELAINE I don't know. Nina. Nina! I'm gonna go grab a bite.
GEORGE Uhh.. I'll meet you down there. Cereal, cereal.. Peach schnapps.
KRAMER Come on, Lomez! We're gonna be late for the movie.
NEWMAN You see, my dear, all certified mail is registered, but registered mail is not necessarily cerified.
WOMAN I could listen to you talk about mail all day.
KRAMER Anything you wish.. I'll tell you a little secret about zip codes: They're meaningless!
KRAMER Wish?! Newman!
ALL ..And you smell like one, too.
POSTMAN Make a wish, Newman! We've gotta get back to work in three hours!
KRAMER Newman, wait!
NEWMAN Kramer! I'm with people.
KRAMER Yeah, yeah. And thanks for inviting me!
NEWMAN I did invite you.. Your invitation must've.. gotten lost in the mail.
KRAMER Well, Newman, I need your wish to protect me from FDR.
NEWMAN Can't do it. I'm on an unbelievable birthday-wish hot streak! My last five birthday wishes came true.
KRAMER Come on! Look, I'll give you my next birthday wish, huh?
NEWMAN Your next.. fifty wishes.
KRAMER Forty-eight.
NEWMAN Fourty-nine.
KRAMER Done!
NEWMAN_AND_KRAMER Sucker..
NEWMAN Alright, alright, back, savages. Back! I haven't made my wish yet..
ELAINE Well, this Mischke mish-mash is just gettin' worse.
JERRY Uh-huh.
ELAINE I talked with the groom's parents..
JERRY Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm..
ELAINE ..And it's so obvious that they don't want..
JERRY Uh-huh..
ELAINE ..me to go.
JERRY Sure.
ELAINE So, the only reason..
JERRY Uh-huh.
ELAINE ..she sent me an invitation was that so I'd send her a gift.
JERRY Uh-huh.
NINA Jerry?
JERRY Uh, well, you know, a coffee grinder is nice. Or a coffee maker. Everyone likes coffee. Anything to do with coffee. Maybe you should go get some coffee.
NINA Oh. Hi.
ELAINE Hi.
NINA Oh, I should.. um..
JERRY Sure.
ELAINE Bye.
NINA Bye-bye.
ELAINE Who else ya got back there?
JERRY Look, there was an awkward moment in the conversation. It never happened before.
ELAINE You slept with Nina? What are you gonna tell George?
JERRY Nothing. And neither will you. George can never know about this.. It'll crush him.
ELAINE Uh. Alright, alright. I'll put it in the vault.
JERRY No good. Too many people know the combination.
ELAINE What combination? Don't be rediculous.
JERRY Oh my god. This drawer is filled with Fruit Loops!
ELAINE So what?
JERRY And milk.
KRAMER Oh, geez..
JERRY Hello?
ELAINE Hi. Mr. and Mrs. Ranawat?
ZUBIN Please, call us Usha and Zubin.
ELAINE Oh. Well, Usha..
ZUBIN I'm Zubin.
ELAINE Anyway, your son is marrying my friend, Sue Ellen Mischke..
USHA You're not going to the wedding, are you?
ELAINE Well..
USHA Don't go. India is a dreadful, dreadful place.
ZUBIN You know, it's the only country that still has the plague? I mean, the plague! Please!
USHA Here's the registry. Send her a gift, and be glad you did not have to go.
ELAINE Right. Don't go. Send a gift. I think I understand.
ZUBIN If I had to go to India, I wouldn't go to the bathroom the entire trip.
ELAINE That's fantastic.
ZUBIN And I'm not so crazy about Manhattan, either.
NINA Oh, you were going to tell me all about George.
JERRY Ah, just remember when you see him tomarrow night to tell him that the waiter liked him.
NINA Really?
JERRY Believe me. You know, I forgot how much fun it is hanging out with you.
NINA I know. You know, we never had a bad conversation.
JERRY I know. No awkward pauses. Probably the reason we never fooled around..
NINA Heh.. yeah.
JERRY Probably the reason..
FDR Are - are you dense? I said I wanted you to drop dead. Now.. drop dead!
KRAMER I knew it.. Stupid Jerry..
JERRY Kramer, I know what I'm talking about. There's no way FDR wants you to drop dead.
KRAMER But you haven't seen..
JERRY Just go back and ask him again.
KRAMER Yeah..
FDR That's right. My birthday wish was for you to drop dead.
KRAMER Well, why?
FDR I have my reasons.
KRAMER Woah, wait, wait, wait. If you make a birthday wish out loud, it doesn't come true.
FDR That's just a silly superstition.
KRAMER Hey, FDR wants me to drop dead.
GEORGE fdr?
KRAMER Yeah, Franklin Delano Romanowski. I go to his birthday part, and just before he blew out his candles, he gives me this look..
GEORGE Stink eye?
JERRY Crook eye?
KRAMER EVIL eye.
JERRY Well, everybody's a little cranky on their birthday..
GEORGE Oh, it's a bad day. Uh, you got everyone in your house, you're thinkin', "These are my friends?!"
JERRY Everyday is my birthday.
KRAMER Yeah, well, I can't have this hanging over my head. It's bad mojo.
ELAINE Hi.
ELAINE You're not gonna believe what I got in the mail. An invitation to Sue Ellen Mischke's wedding.
JERRY Well, at least the wedding gown will give her some support.
ELAINE Not the point. The wedding is in one week. I got this today.
JERRY So you think it's a non-vite?
ELAINE It's an un-vitation! Hey, are you gettin' taller?
GEORGE Timberlands.
ELAINE Ah. Hey, look at this. 'Pinter Ranawat'.. I wonder if he's related to that guy I dated, Peter Ranawat..
JERRY Ah, it's probably like Smith over there.
GEORGE Jerry, would you make the call already?
ELAINE What call?
JERRY He wants me to set him up with this girl, Nina Stengal.
ELAINE Oh, the great conversation girl. The one you think can replace me?
JERRY I was kidding when I said that!
GEORGE Told me the same thing.
JERRY Nina, Hi. It's Jerry.
GEORGE You-you sure you never slept with her? Perfect.
JERRY Hey, how 'bout my friend, George? Quite a guy, huh?
GEORGE Ooh.. Something's not sitting right..
GEORGE I'll have the clam casino.
JERRY Get outta here.
GEORGE "Chef recommends"
JERRY Hmm..
GEORGE I think she likes me.
JERRY Sure.
GEORGE So, how come nothing ever happened between you and Nina? Is there a problem with her? Is she a man?
JERRY Are you?
GEORGE Well, what's the reason?
JERRY We were too compatible.. Our conversations were so engrossing.
GEORGE How engrossing?
JERRY If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in Nina and not lose a step.
GEORGE Wow! Heh. You don't, huh, have a replacement lined up for me, do ya?
JERRY Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the trasition from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses.. I need an awkward pause.
GEORGE I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her.. Wait a minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wwear them every time I see her.
JERRY Why?
GEORGE In any othe shoe, I lose two inches. I - I can't have a drop down. We were eye to eye, I can't go eye to chin!
JERRY So, you're gonna wear 'em no matter what the situation?
GEORGE In every situation. No matter how silly I look. Hm.. tastes a little funky.
JERRY Oh, I'm sure it's fine.
ALL ..to you!
MAN Come on, make a wish! Make a wish!
KRAMER Yeah!
GEORGE Ah, this is the kind of day that almost makes you feel good to be alive.
JERRY Almost. Hey, new Timberlands?
GEORGE Yeah, and a whole new me. I'm up two inches in these babies!
JERRY Really?
GEORGE Five' eight. Five' seven.
NINA Jerry?
JERRY Nina?
NINA Hi.
JERRY It's been years!
NINA Yeah!
JERRY George, this is Nina.
GEORGE Nice to meet you.
NINA Nice to meet you, too.
ELAINE India? Yeah, right. I'm goin' to India..
NINA And they call it the World Wide Web. You can e-mail anyone!
JERRY What are you, a scientist?!
NINA Ah, I gotta go.
JERRY Ah.
NINA It's great talkin'
JERRY Great talkin' to you. What the hell is e-mail?
GEORGE How as the date?
JERRY Pretty good. I think she might be the one.
SUSAN No.
GEORGE Whooo.. Ooh.. French fries.
SUSAN Ah, George.
GEORGE Baked, uh, potato.
SUSAN Uh-huh.
GEORGE Sorry.
SUSAN yeah, you stuff your sorries in a sack, mister.
KRAMER Hey, hey. Yeah, check it out. It's packin' tight!
JERRY What are you bringing snowballs in here for?
KRAMER Oh, I need some water. Ice it up nice and hard.. and when you throw it - Pop! Oh look, there's my friend, FDR. I'm gonna nail him in the back of the head. It's gonna be great!
JERRY Hi, Elaine.
GEORGE Hey!
ELAINE Hey, let's go someplace else, Okay, Peter?
KRAMER Oh, hey, how you doing?
JERRY Oh, hi. I-I'm Jerry Seinfeld. I'm movin' in. I saw your name on the buzzer - You must be Kessler.
KRAMER Uh, no. Actually, it's Kramer.
JERRY Oh.
KRAMER Uh, you need any help, or..?
JERRY No, thanks. But I ordered a pizza. You want some of it?
KRAMER Uh, no, no, no. I couldn't impose.
JERRY Why not? We're neighbors. What's mine is yours.
KRAMER Really?
GEORGE Jerry! Georgie's moving out!
JERRY Get out!
GEORGE I'm out! Fantastic apartment right across from mine, huh. I can't wait for you to see it.
JERRY Is it better than mine?
GEORGE Oh yeah.
JERRY So, it's a two-bedroom-one-bath-make-your-friends-hate-ya?
GEORGE You know what? It's better than Elaine's, too. I gotta give her a call.
JERRY She's out.
GEORGE Oh right, the blind date.
JERRY Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now. I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those losers.
GEORGE Come on. Come check out my new place. It'll take you two minutes.
JERRY I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage.
GEORGE Hey, you got any extra furniture down there? I need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with the walk-in closet.
JERRY Oh, this is really annoying.
GEORGE It's working already!
JERRY What is with that?!
KRAMER Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expells the diseased germs out of the body, into the air.
JERRY Where is your key?
KRAMER Yeah, well, uh, Newman. He's - he's got it.
JERRY You know, Kramer, I rented out half of my space to you.
KRAMER Yeah, and I rented out half that space to Newman.
JERRY Mail bags? He's storing mail in here?
KRAMER Evidently.
RICARDI Excuse me, George?
GEORGE Yeah, uh, no menus.
RICARDI No, I'm Mrs. Ricardi - president of the tenant's association.
GEORGE Oh, right! Right! Hey, hey.. I love the floors in here. It's like a gymnasium in here! Try and guard me! toward Mrs. Ricadi. She backs off defensively Come on!
RICARDI No, no.. Uh, George, unfortunately, Clarance Eldridge in 8C has decided that he wants the apartment.
GEORGE Yeah, but you - you promised it to me.
RICARDI Yes, but, you see - Mister Eldridge is an Andrea Doria survivor. And, in light of the terrible suffering that he's already been through, we've decided to give it to him.
GEORGE Well,.. the Andrea Doria.. that was quite a fire. .
RICARDI Shipwreck.
GEORGE I remember..
ELAINE Where is this guy?! I hate this! I shoulda brought something to read.. "Cancer in labratory animals".. huh.
WAITER Excuse me, Elaine Benes?
ELAINE Yeah?
WAITER An Alan Mercer called for you. He said he's sorry, but he won't be able to make it tonight. He's been stabbed.
ELAINE Stabbed?!
WAITER More bread? Jerry's apartment
JERRY You ate more bread?
ELAINE That is not the point! The guy was stabbed!
JERRY Did you find out who stabbed him?
ELAINE Yeah, It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend.
JERRY Well, you're not going near this hooligan anymore.
ELAINE Well, I don't know.. I mean, think about it, Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion. I mean, to be stab-worthy.. You know, it's.. kind of a compliment.
JERRY Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. He could have been the one.
KRAMER Hey. How's everybody?
JERRY_AND_ELAINE Hey.
KRAMER Ehh.. No expiration date on this..
JERRY There is now. Kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor.
KRAMER Nah, no, no, no. No doctors for me. A bunch of lackeys and yes-men all towing the company line.. Plus, the botched my vasectimy.
JERRY The botched it?
KRAMER I'm even more potent now!
GEORGE Hey.
JERRY Hey. How's the new place?!
GEORGE Gone. The tenant association made me give it to this guy because he was an Andrea Doria survivor..
ELAINE Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did the song about?
JERRY Edmund Fitzgerald.
ELAINE I love Edmund Fitzgerald's voice.
JERRY No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship.
GEORGE You could fit 15 people in that bathroom..
ELAINE I think Gordon Lightfoot was the boat.
JERRY Yeah, and it was rammed by the Cat Stevens.
KRAMER The Andrea Doria collided with the Stockholm in dense fog 21 miles off the coast of Nantucket.
GEORGE How do you know?
KRAMER it's in my book - "Astonishing Tales of the Sea" 51 people died.
GEORGE 51 people?!
KRAMER That's it?! I thought it was, like, a thousand!
KRAMER There were 1,650 survivors.
GEORGE That's no tragedy! How many people do you lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! Kramer, can I take a look at that book?
KRAMER Oh yeah. I also got "Astounding Bear Attacks"
JERRY Hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman about getting that mail outta there?
KRAMER Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, he's not gonna do it. Newman's apartment
JERRY Newman?
NEWMAN I guess.
JERRY Listen, I want you to get the mail outta my storage unit.
NEWMAN Sometimes we don't get what we want.
JERRY What are you talking about?
NEWMAN I didn't get my transfer.
JERRY "Transfer"?
NEWMAN To Hawaii. The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to like the stamps.. But it's not to be - So, I'm hanging it up.
JERRY You quit the post office?
NEWMAN Kind of. I'm still collecting checks, I'm just not delivering mail.
JERRY Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal.
NEWMAN And yet, it's perfectly legal to take a man's soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall.
JERRY Well, a law's a law. Central Park
KRAMER Ok, hold on there.. That's a nasty cough you got there, huh?
MAN What cough? Restaurant
ELAINE I love shrimp! I'm a shrimp eater. You put shrimp infront of me, and I will eat it until my stomach pops! Oh..
ALAN No, it's okay. I'm.. still just a little bit jumpy.
ELAINE Between you and me, what happened there with the stabbing?
ALAN Just.. one of those things, you know.
ELAINE What? Was she just so crazy in love with you that she just couldn't take it anymore? Or..?
ALAN I don't know. Could be.
CAROL Alan?!
ALAN Carol?
ELAINE Was that the one?! Was that the one who stabbed you?!
ALAN No, that was a different girl. Coffee shop
JERRY There was another crazed ex-girlfriend?
ELAINE Right, so, I called my friend, you know - the one who set us up - I found out, he's a bad-breaker-upper.
JERRY Mmm.. Bad how?
ELAINE Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean, but he means them.
JERRY I follow. So what are you gonna do?
ELAINE Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't break up nicely. I mean, to me, that's one of the most important parts of a relationship.
JERRY What's more important? NYC Street
KRAMER Hey.
GEORGE What's with the dog?
KRAMER Yeah, this is Smuckers. I borrowed him.
GEORGE Oh..
KRAMER Yeah, we share the same affliction, so I'm gonna have a vet check us out.
GEORGE A vet?
KRAMER Oh, I'll take a vet over an M.D. any day. They gotta be able to cure a lizard, a chicken, a pig, a frog - all on the same day.
GEORGE So, if I may jump ahead - you're gonna take dog medicine?
KRAMER You bet we are! Huh, Smuckers? I'll see ya. George's apartment building
GEORGE Ahoy! Mr. Eldridge. I understand you were on the Andrea Doria.
ELDRIDGE Yes, it was a terrifying ordeal.
GEORGE I tell ya, I hear people really stuff themselves on those cruise ships. The buffet, that's the real ordeal, huh, Clarence?
ELDRIDGE We had to abandon ship.
GEORGE Well, all vacations have to end eventually.
ELDRIDGE The boat sank.
GEORGE According to this, it took.. 10 hours. It eased into the water like an old man into a nice warm bath - no offence. So, uh, Clarence, how about abandoning this apartment, and letting me shove off in this beauty?
ELDRIDGE Is that what this is all about?! I don't think I like you.
GEORGE It's my apartment, Eldridge! The Stalkholm may not have sunk ya, but I will! Ha, ha, ha! Vet's office
VET What are the symptoms?
KRAMER Well, uh.. it hurts when he swallows. Expecially when he drinks orange juice. I mean, uh.. dog food.. juice. What's worse - he has a nagging cough. Yeah, that's it. That's it.
VET Yeah, well, uh - we've been seeing a lot of this lately. Been drinking from the toilet?
KRAMER What? No. That's disgusting.. Coffee shop
ALAN So that's it? We're, uh, we're breakin' up?
ELAINE What? Break-up? We went out on one date.
ALAN Ok, yeah, sure, fine, right. Whatever you say.
ELAINE Alright, good. Good.
ALAN Ok, then, well, So.. see ya around.. big head.
ELAINE Pardon?
ALAN You got a big head. It's too big for your body.
ELAINE That's it?! That's the best you got?! Jerry's apartment
GEORGE So, he's keeping the apartment. He doesn't deserve it, though! Even if he did suffer, that was, like, 40 years ago! What has he been doing lately?! I've been suffering for the past 30 years up to and including yesterday!
JERRY You know, if this tenant board is so impressed with suffering, maybe you should tell them the "Astonishing Tales of Costanza".
GEORGE I should!
JERRY I mean, your body of work in this field is unparalleled.
GEORGE I could go bumper to bumper with any one else on this planet!
JERRY You're the man!
NEWMAN Jerry!
JERRY I'm with people, I'll be with you in a moment. So, you want a protein shake, or something?
GEORGE Nah, I guess I should really get moving on this, huh? I'm gonna go.
JERRY Hello.. Newman.
NEWMAN I need that mail, where is it?!
JERRY What's the difference?
NEWMAN The guy who had the Hawaii transfer got busted for hoarding Victoria Secret catalogues. I gotta deliver that mail!
JERRY Well, go ahead. There's 8 bags of it.
NEWMAN Blast! There's no way I can handle 8 in addition to my ususal load of one! I'll never get to Hawaii! I'll be stuck in this apartment building forever! The dream is dead.
JERRY You're giving up that easy?
NEWMAN I usually do. See ya.
JERRY No, wait a minute, Newman! You can't let this dream die. You moving away is my dream too!
NEWMAN What are you proposing?
JERRY Whatever it takes, for as long as it takes me, where ever it takes me as long as it takes you away from me!
NEWMAN An alliance?
JERRY An alliance. Now get the hell outta here. Jerry's apartment
ELAINE Hawaii? That's why you're helping Newman with the mail?
JERRY Elaine, Newman is my sworn enemy. And he lives down the hall from my home - my home, Elaine! Where I sleep, where I come to play with my toys.
ELAINE Well, anyway, get this: I spoke to Alan. You know, I told him I didn't want to see him anymore.. He called me "big head".
JERRY "Big head" That's almost a compliment.
ELAINE It's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.
JERRY Hello?
GEORGE Hey.
JERRY Hey, George.
GEORGE Yeah, listen, I can't make it later.
JERRY You can't make it?
GEORGE Yeah, the tenant association has decided to hear my side of the story. So, uh, I gotta kinda get ready. I'll see ya.
JERRY Alright.
ELAINE Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop?
JERRY Doesn't look like it's gonna happen.
ELAINE Alright, well, I'll see ya.
JERRY Kramer, aren't you taking any medication for that?
KRAMER Yeah, yeah. I got some pilss. They taste terrible.
JERRY Just swallow 'em.
KRAMER No, my throat's too tender.
JERRY Alright, sit down, sit down.
KRAMER I don't want to!
JERRY C'mon. Just sit down!
KRAMER Jerry! What?!
JERRY Sit down! Sit down!
KRAMER Hey!
JERRY Lean your head back. Open your mouth! Open your mouth! Open it! Open it!
JERRY What kind of pills are these, anyways?! "For Smuckers"? "May cause panting and loss of fur"? These are dog pills!
KRAMER Whe have the same symptoms.
JERRY But, he's a dog! You need to see a real doctor.
KRAMER No, no. No doctors.
JERRY Alright..
KRAMER Where are you going?
JERRY I'm taking the car. I gotta run some errands. You want to go?
KRAMER I don't know..
JERRY C'mon, you wanna go for a ride? Huh? C'mon! C'mon! Taxi cab
DRIVER Lady, could you move your head a little bit?
ELAINE What?
DRIVER Your head. I can't see out the back. Little more.. ..Little more. Thank you. Jerry's car
KRAMER I don't see any tissues back her.. Wait a minute!.. This isn't the way to the park! Where are we going?.. I recognize this block! You're taking me to the doctor! Coffee shop
GEORGE So, uh, Mom, Dad, I was hoping that you could help me to remember my childhood a little clearly..
ESTELLE I feel a draft. Let's change tables.
FRANK Get outta here! We have a booth.
ESTELLE Frank, I'm cold!
FRANK Order a hot dish.
ESTELLE Why can't we sit over there?
FRANK That's not a booth!
ESTELLE So, who says we have to sit in a booth?!
FRANK I didn't take the subway all the way to New York to sit at a table like that!
ESTELLE Well, I didn't take the subway to be in a drafty restaurant!
GEORGE Mom.. dad.
FRANK Now, George, what do you want to know about your childhood?
GEORGE Actually, I think I'm pretty clear on it.
FRANK Where's that breeze coming from? NYC Street
JERRY Kramer, outta the car. Out, now!
KRAMER No, Jerry!
JERRY Alright, that's it..
KRAMER No! Don't!
JERRY Hey, hey! Get back over here! Kramer! Get over here! You are bad! Bad neighbor! Kramer! Tenant board room
ELDRIDGE Just then, a rescue ship emerged from the fog and saved us. It was.. It was the sweetest sight my eyes ever saw.
RICARDI Thank you Mr. Eldridge. The tenant board will now hear Mr. Costanza's testimony. Newman's apartment
JERRY Newman, how'd it go? Did you get it all delivered? What happened?
NEWMAN Kramer bit me!
JERRY Bit you?!
NEWMAN We had an arguement about me going to Hawaii, and he locked onto my ankle like it was a soup bone. I'm hubbled! I don't think I can do my route - and they're awarding the transfer in two days!
JERRY Well, what if I deliver it?
NEWMAN You?! You can't deliver mail!
JERRY Well, why not?
NEWMAN I guess you're right. It's just walking around putting it into boxes..
JERRY What am I gonna wear?
NEWMAN I could give you my uniform from my rookie year.
JERRY I can't believe I'm gonna be a mailman!
JERRY There you go. Merry Chirstmas!
OWNER Mail on Sunday?
JERRY Oops. Tenant board room
GEORGE I was handcuffed to the bed.. In my underwear, where I remained.. She was attractive.. She was, also, infact, a Nazi.. The water.. that I had been swiming in was.. very cold. And, when I dropped the towel, there was.. significant shrinkage.. Her parents were looking at me.. So, there I was, with a marble rye hanging from the end of a fishing pole.. In closing, these stories have not been embellished, because - they need no embellishment. They are simply, horrifyingly, the story of my life as a short, stocky, slow witted bald man. Thank you. Oh, also.. my fiance died from licking toxic envelopes that I picked out. Thanks again. Newman's apartment
JERRY Hey, I've been trying to jam stuff in the box, like you told me, but sometimes it says, like, "Photographs - Do not bend".
NEWMAN "Do not bend". Just crease, crumple, cram.. you'll do fine. Hello?.. This is he. I don't understand.. very well.
JERRY What?
NEWMAN That was the Vice President of the post office. I didn't get the transfer.. They knew it wasn't me doing my route!
JERRY How did they know?!
JERRY I tried my best!
NEWMAN Exactly. You're a disgrace to the uniform.
JERRY You know, this is your coat.
NEWMAN Damn! Central park
MAN_2 He flew right into your head. Like he couldn't avoid it.
ELAINE Really?
MAN_2 Never seen that before. Bird into a woman's head.. Coffee shop
GEORGE It's not contest. The guy had nothing! The ship went down, he got into a life boat, I mean, come on.
JERRY Boy, he didn't know what he was up against. So, when do you move into the apartment?
GEORGE They're making their decision today.
JERRY What's the matter with you?
ELAINE Nothing.. Except that a bird ran into my giant freak-head.
JERRY What giant freak-head?
ELAINE The one that sits atop my disproportunately puny body.. I'm a walking candy apple!
JERRY So, it's actually gotten to you? You're playing right into his hands!
ELAINE What? Yeah.. you're right!.. All I have to do is call him up, and sit with him, and show him that it doesn't bother me. You know, laugh it off.. or jam a fork into his forehead.
JERRY Either way.
ELAINE Alright. Restaurant
ALAN I want to apologize for..
ELAINE Oh, please.
ALAN So you have a big head.
ELAINE So what?
ALAN It goes well with that bump in your nose.
ELAINE What?!
WOMAN Please! Get help! There's a crazy big-headed woman beating up some guy! Tell the police "The Old Mill Restaurant". Hurry!
COP Boy, that's some cough you got there.
COP_2 No, I think he's trying to tell us something. What is it? Trouble?! Trouble? Where? Where's trouble? Trouble at the Old Mill?! Oh my god! Good boy, good boy! Lead the way! Come on. George's apartment building
GEORGE Excuse me, uh, what are you doing in there?
ALAN I'm moving in. Alan Mercer. New neighbor.
GEORGE What? Elaine's big-head guy? They have you the apartment?!
ALAN Yeah.
GEORGE Why?! Because you were stabbed, and.. got coffee thrown in your face, and.. uh..
ALAN Oh, fork in the forehead.
GEORGE That's why they gave you the apartment?
ALAN No, I just gave the super 50 bucks.
GEORGE Wait a minute, that is my apartment. I earned it with 34 years of misery!
ALAN Tough luck, chinless.
GEORGE What is Holland?
JERRY What do you mean, 'what is it?' It's a country right next to Belgium.
GEORGE No, that's the Netherlands.
JERRY Holland is the Netherlands.
GEORGE Then who are the Dutch?
JERRY You know I cannot stand this thing anymore.
GEORGE I know, I hate it too. I feel like an out of work porn star.
JERRY I told you, we should have taken some kind of vacation.
GEORGE Well why didn't we?
JERRY Because you said this would be better. Remember? A vacation from ourselves. That's what you said.
GEORGE What if we grew muttonchops?
JERRY No.
GEORGE Buzz cuts? Parachute pants!
JERRY Stop it, George. Stop it. I'm sorry, you've gotta get a job.
GEORGE Dammit.
GEORGE Hey hey hey, check me out, huh?
JERRY No more crutches, that must be a relief.
GEORGE Yeah, with crutches everyone has questions.
JERRY Not with a cane?
GEORGE Nah, with crutches it's a funny story, with a cane it's a sad story. You through with those?
JERRY Always a sad story. Hey, you should have been here tonight. Some guy from NBC saw my set, he wants me to do a showcase. I might have another shot at a pilot.
GEORGE Alright, we're back in!
JERRY We? No.
CLUB_ANNOUNCER Ladies and gentlemen, Kenny Bania.
BANIA Thank you, thank you, Hey, Jerry, didja see me up there? I was killing, Jerry. Killing. I killed.
JERRY Killed?
BANIA Killed. I'm gonna go pick up some chicks. Good looking ones too! Hey, what's your name?
GEORGE Killed.
JERRY Because I killed first and warmed up the crowd. He's like that fish that attaches himself to the shark.
GEORGE And you're the shark?
JERRY Yeah, I'm the shark and he's the fish eating my laughs.
GEORGE I don't know how a fish could eat laughs.
JERRY Well, I'm glad I brought it up.
KRAMER Got any shredded coconut?
JERRY Uh, we're not doing that any more.
KRAMER Yeah, yeah, right.
GEORGE Oh my god.
JERRY What?
GEORGE I got a job interview. They want to see me this afternoon.
JERRY So what's this job?
GEORGE Oh, it's beautiful. It's in sports.
JERRY Knicks? Rangers?
GEORGE Playground equipment.
JERRY Welcome back to the show.
KRAMER Yeah, this is better. So, you got any shredded coconut?
JERRY No.
GEORGE I gotta hobble.
KRAMER I gotta switch shaving cream. I'm getting no protection.
JERRY What kind do you use?
KRAMER Whatever you get.
JERRY Look, postcard from Elaine from Europe.
KRAMER Don't tell me she's dragging another poor guy across Europe.
JERRY Remember David Puddy?
KRAMER She's dating him again, huh?
JERRY Well, I guess she's batted around and she's back at the top of the order.
KRAMER Boy, a month in Europe with Elaine. That guy's coming home in a body bag.
PUDDY Well, let's see, I've got a ten kroner, a five kroner, a twenty kroner. No wait, that's another ten kroner. A fimty kroner? How much is that?
ELAINE We have to break up.
PUDDY What?
ELAINE I can't take this any more! I don't want to hear how interesting the change with the hole in it is! And if you tell me what time it is in New York again, you are going home in a body bag!
PUDDY Well what about you? What do you think The Gap in Rome has that's not in The Gap on Broadway?
ELAINE Okay, alright listen. Forget about The Gap because we are through!
PUDDY Fine!
ELAINE Fine!
CAB_DRIVER Okay, terminal three. Have a nice flight.
CAPTAIN Ladies and gentlemen, our flight time, with stopovers, will be approximately 22 hours.
ELAINE Hey, you gonna bust out that drink cart or what?
KRAMER Hey, what are you doing?
JERRY Oh, I'm taking this lace out. It came undone and touched the floor of a men's room. That's the end of that.
KRAMER Did you see Bania's set last night? 'Cause I read on the Internet he killed.
JERRY He killed. He only does well when he has me for a lead-in. He's a time slot hit.
KRAMER Well, you gotta give him some credit. You're just being totally ridiculous. I'll see you later buddy.
JERRY Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
KRAMER What?
JERRY Do I have to ask?
KRAMER I ran out of butter so I had to borrow yours. Anything else, Mr. Nosy?
JERRY Why are you buttering your face?
KRAMER I'm shaving with it.
JERRY Oh Moses smell the roses.
KRAMER Jerry, it's vastly superior to any commercial shaving cream. Now feel my face.
JERRY No.
KRAMER Feel it.
JERRY I don't want to.
KRAMER Feel it. Feel it.
JERRY That is close.
GEORGE I got the job?
MR._THOMASSOULO I don't want you to think that anyone's gonna treat you any differently just because of your, uh, handicap.
GEORGE Handicap? I'm not handicapped.
MR._THOMASSOULO I'm sorry. Differently, uh, advantaged.
GEORGE Yeah, I didn't mean that.
MR._THOMASSOULO Of course you will have your own private, fully equipped bathroom.
GEORGE When do I start?
MR._THOMASSOULO Whenever you feel that you're able. Um, you need a hand here.
GEORGE Yeah, what the hell.
JERRY You got the job?
GEORGE Jerry, it's fantastic. I love the people over there. They treat me so great. You know they think I'm handicapped, they gave me this incredible office, a great view.
JERRY Hold on, they think you're handicapped?
GEORGE Yeah, yeah, well, because of the cane. You should see the bathroom they gave me!
JERRY How can you do this?
GEORGE Jerry, let's face it, I've always been handicapped. I'm just now getting the recognition for it. Name one thing I have that puts me in a position of advantage. Huh? There was a guy that worked at the Yankees-- no arms! He got more work done than I did, made more money, had a wife, a family, drove a better car than I did.
JERRY He drove a car with no arms?
GEORGE Alright I made up the part about the car, but the rest is true. He hated me anyway!
JERRY Do you know how hard it's getting just to tell people I know you?
GEORGE I love that bathroom. It's got that high, high toilet. I feel like a gargoyle perched on the ledge of a building.
KRAMER They hooked me up.
GEORGE What's with all the butter?
KRAMER I'm shaving with it, and you know what I discovered?
JERRY You can eat it?
KRAMER No, my face feels so good, I'm gonna use it all over my body.
JERRY Oh my god, it's Bania and Jenna.
GEORGE Who?
JERRY The tooth brush in the toilet bowl.
BANIA Hey Jerry, this is Jenna. Pretty good lookin' huh?
JENNA Jerry's the guy that I dated right before you.
BANIA Oh. This is awkward.
JENNA Don't worry, Kenny. After dating Jerry, you're a pleasure.
JERRY I don't believe this.
GEORGE You miss her, don't you?
JERRY No! He's riding my coattails again. He's getting everything off me, first laughs now ladies.
GEORGE You miss her.
PUDDY You know I think ultimately, I'm upset with myself. I knew what I was getting into, she's a bitter, unstable person. I mean the sex was good. I'm sure it was fine for her. I need more.
ELAINE Huh. You believing this?
PASSENGER Excuse me, I was sleeping.
ELAINE You missed quite a performance.
PASSENGER That's my apple juice.
JERRY Someone's cooking.
NEWMAN Hello, Jerry.
JERRY Hello, Newman.
NEWMAN You know, old friend, sometimes I ponder this silly gulf between us and I say, "Why?" Are we really so different. For what is--
JERRY I'm not the one doing the cooking, Newman.
NEWMAN Damn you Seinfeld. You useless pustule. Um, somebody's got something on the griddle. Maybe it's Kramer.
JERRY No, he's up on the roof getting some sun with the butter - pause - Oh no!
NEWMAN Butter?
PASSENGER -Fimty kroner.
ELAINE You know my last boyfriend, he had a real kroner comprehension problem. No what I mean? A real cement head.
WOMAN David, you are so funny.
PUDDY Yeah, I know.
ELAINE What are you doing?
PUDDY It's a long flight, Elaine. I had to get on with my life.
ELAINE By making time with some floozy across the aisle?
PUDDY Yeah, that's right. Well, what's going on over there with you and, uh, vegetable lasagna?
ELAINE This guy? He's an idiot. He doesn't mean anything to me.
PASSENGER I can hear you.
PUDDY Well, she doesn't mean anything to me either. If it were up to me, we'd still be together.
ELAINE Well maybe I feel the same way.
PUDDY Ok.
ELAINE Ok, so now what?
PUDDY Let's make out.
JERRY Kramer!
KRAMER Oh, man. I think I cooked myself.
JERRY Look at your skin.
KRAMER Stick a fork in me, Jerry. I'm done.
KRAMER I'm fried.
JERRY Technically, you're saut�ed. So, what are you doing for that?
KRAMER Well, I just gotta keep my skin moist so I don't dry out.
JERRY Is that what the doctor said?
KRAMER No, I read an article in Bon Appetite magazine.
GEORGE Hmm. Game hen?
JERRY Kind of. Nice limp, you're bringing your work home with you?
GEORGE No, I fake limp on my right. This is a real limp because I sprained my ankle.
JERRY What happened?
GEORGE Well, I was buttering myself up for a nice shave --
JERRY Oh no, not you too?
GEORGE I must have dripped some on the floor and I slipped and...
JERRY You know what's good for that? Relish.
JERRY Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? No. No! No! No!! No!!!
GEORGE So what, he's got a couple of good jokes.
JERRY Like what, Ovaltine? Why do dogs drink out of the toilet? Shopping carts with one bad wheel?
GEORGE That's true, that always happens to me.
JERRY You think that's funny?
GEORGE I don't know, I like stuff you don't have to think about too much.
JERRY You like Bania's act. You're a closet Bania fan!
GEORGE maybe I am.
JERRY Oh, I'm gonna puke.
GEORGE Puke! That's a funny word. Puke. puke! Don't have to think about that.
ELAINE I can't believe we broke up like that.
ELAINE Do you want something to read?
PUDDY Nah.
ELAINE Well, are you going to take a nap or
PUDDY Nah.
ELAINE You're just going to sit there staring at the back of a seat?
PUDDY Yeah.
ELAINE That's it! I cannot take this! I mean, look at this, nothing has changed. We're back together two hours, we're having the same problems we had 12 hours ago.
PUDDY Tell me about it, I don't know why I ever took you back.
ELAINE Please! I took you back. You know it, I know it, vegetable lasagna here knows it.
VEGETABLE_LASAGNA I don't want to get involved.
ELAINE Ugh, I hope a giant mountain rises out of the ocean and we just ram right into it and end this whole thing!
VEGETABLE_LASAGNA Oh god.
PASSENGER Ow! Ow!!
NEWMAN How much longer you gonna be, I'm starving here.
KRAMER Just a few more squirts. Cause I gotta stay juicy.
NEWMAN The smell. It's still with you, huh?
KRAMER Yeah, it's baked on it. Put some butter in. Stir it up so it melts.
KRAMER Ahh, now I'm simmering.
NEWMAN I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
MR._THOMASSOULO Good morning, George. Is something wrong with your other leg?
GEORGE Oh, no, that's just the old handicap acting up.
MR._THOMASSOULO But your cane's on the wrong side.
GEORGE That's just because we're standing on opposite sides. See, when we met, I was over there and you were over here so the image was reversed, like in the mirror. They walk over to a mirrored wall.
GEORGE See? This looks right to you, doesn't it?
MR._THOMASSOULO Uh, yeah, I guess.
GEORGE But, see here. Right. Wrong. Right. Wrong. Right. Right. Wrong--
MR._THOMASSOULO Will you stop it, George? Just stop it! I think I can see what's going on here.
GEORGE Well, you're not gonna believe what happened.
JERRY You mugged Stephen Hawking?
GEORGE Play Now thinks I got problems in both legs. My own personal Rascal, Jerry. On the house.
JERRY Well it must be comforting to know you'll be going straight to hell at no more than three miles an hour.
JERRY Hello?
ELAINE Jerry.
JERRY Hey, Lainie, how's the trip going?
ELAINE Awful. This trip was a huge mistake. Huge!
VEGETABLE_LASAGNA Please don't shout. I can't take it.
JERRY Who's that?
ELAINE It's Vegetable Lasagna.
JERRY Who?
ELAINE Vegetable Lasagna!
VEGETABLE_LASAGNA My name is Magnus.
ELAINE Shut up or I'll snap you in half and stuff you in the overhead!
JERRY Get me some duty free Kahlua.
GEORGE How's the trip?
JERRY Sounded good. George. Well. Gotta motor.
JERRY Hey, if you got any juice left, you might wanna roll by the big showcase tonight.
GEORGE Ah, you still going on in front of Bania, eh?
JERRY That's right, and I'll tell you what. I'm feeling a little off.
GEORGE What are you talking about? You're not!
JERRY That's right, I'm taking a dive.
GEORGE You're throwing the set?
JERRY I'm laying down! Then let's see how he does up there, without all the assistance.
GEORGE Listen Jerry. Bania's voice is the voice of a new generation. My generation.
JERRY We're four months apart.
GEORGE nevertheless. His time has come.
GEORGE Now if you will kindly help me unwedge my front wheel, I'll be on my way.
NEWMAN Butter. Kramer. Butter. Kramer.
KRAMER_TURKEY Hey buddy.
KRAMER What are you doing? George tells me you're gonna throw your set?
JERRY That's right, Choochie. Let's see how Bania does without the cushy timeslot.
CLUB_ANNOUNCER Ladies and gentlemen, Jerry Seinfeld!
JERRY If you'll excuse me.
JERRY What's the deal with lampshades? I mean if it's a lamp, why do you want shade?
JERRY And what's with people getting sick?
NEWMAN Hee hee! Yeah yeah!
JERRY I mean, what's the deal with cancer?
MAN_IN_AUDIENCE I have cancer!
KRAMER Oh, tough crowd.
MAN Hey, hey! You dented my ride.
GEORGE Whatcha got there, the 4 volt? Heh, I did you a favor.
MAN How about I do you a favor upside your head?
GEORGE Oh yeah?
MAN Oh yeah.
MAN Hey!
WOMAN Get the bikes.
BANIA Ouch.
KRAMER You didn't do so bad.
JERRY What are you talking about? I bombed!
KRAMER No, you had some good stuff. The cancer bit? It was edgy, it was not my sort of thing but some of those people out there, they really liked it.
JERRY Like who?
KRAMER Like that guy who yelled out.
JERRY He had cancer!
KRAMER And laughter is the best medicine.
JERRY Hey, sorry Kenny. Guess you got your work cut out for you.
CLUB_ANNOUNCER Ladies and gentlemen, Kenny Bania!
KRAMER Hey, Jerry, he could have used your laugh. He was a big turkey out there.
NEWMAN Turkey?
KRAMER A big fat turkey.
NEWMAN I'm sorry I missed that.
KRAMER He worked so hard and then he just-- \
KRAMER What is this, oregano?
KRAMER Look at me! I'm all covered in oregano and Parmesan, and it's sticking to me because of the butter! Look at me!
NEWMAN Here. Hold this.
KRAMER What is this, parsley?
JERRY Ah, the sweet stench of failure.
KRAMER Get off of me, get off of me!
MAN Now I got you!
MR._THOMASSOULO George? Your legs!
GEORGE Are you a religious man, sir?
MR._THOMASSOULO No.
MAN Eat hickory!!
BANIA Hey Jerry, didja see it?
JERRY Ouch.
STU Kenny! There you are. Jay Shermak and Stu Crespi from NBC. Listen, Kenny. Really funny out there.
JERRY What?
JAY That thing you did having the two guys running through? I love stuff you don't have to think too much about.
STU Give us a call. We want to be in the Kenny Bania business.
JAY By the way, Jerry? The suspenders? A little hacky.
BANIA How about that Jerry? First you had a pilot on NBC and now I'll have one. Looks like I'm following you again.
JERRY Oh, I'm gonna puke.
BANIA Puke? That's a funny word. Can I use that?
ELAINE David, this has been the worst month of my life and if I never see you again it'll be too soon.
PUDDY Ditto.
ELAINE Oh that's origi-
PUDDY Shut up. Elaine gets into a taxi cab.
ELAINE 86th and Broadway please.
CAB_DRIVER I'm sorry lady, there's a cab shortage. The Transit Police are making everybody share.
ELAINE Oh no.
VEGETABLE_LASAGNA Hello! Oh no. I'm sorry.
ELAINE Noooooooooooo!
JERRY So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, nail it. Give it some gas! We're flying!
GAVIN Travelling, of course, is the best education. Do you know last year I was in over forty, forty-five countries, and I would have gone to more but I had just got a puppy, and he was too young to take with me. But now I won't travel without him.
JERRY Is he on the plane now?
GAVIN Oh yes. Yes, he's in the, he's in the baggage compartment. I don't know why they won't let him sit up here with me. He's a lot better behaved than most of the dregs you find onboard here. Do you, do you have any pets?
JERRY Uh, just my next door neighbor.
GAVIN You're missing out on a relationship that could enrich your life in ways that you never could have thought possible.
JERRY Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?
JERRY What's the matter?
GAVIN Oh, I'm feeling a bit queasy.
ATTENDANT_1 Sir, we're gonna make an emergency landing in Chicago and get you to a hospital.
GAVIN My dog. What about my dog?
ATTENDANT_1 Uh, you have a dog?
ATTENDANT_2 Do you know anyone on the plane, Mr. Palone?
GAVIN Jerry?
JERRY Huh? How you feeling?
GAVIN Would you take care of Farfel?
JERRY Farfel?
ATTENDANT_2 It's his dog. We're landing in Chicago to get him to a hospital, could you take his dog to New York?
JERRY The dog? The dog??
GAVIN I'm sure it's only for a day or two.
JERRY But, you know, what if, you know?
GAVIN Give me your address and phone number, I'll call you.
JERRY The dog?
JERRY Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid idiot! Shut up! So what would you do?
ELAINE Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call.
JERRY Stop it! Shut up!! Do you believe this? Do you believe what I'm dealing with here, I've got a wild animal in the house! He's deranged, maybe he's got rabies. I can get lockjaw.
ELAINE If only.
JERRY Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of the house since I got back.
ELAINE Hey, when you walk him, do ya...
JERRY Do I what?
ELAINE Do you pick it up?
JERRY Yes, I pick it up.
ELAINE You pick it up?!?
JERRY Well you have to.
ELAINE Oh, boy would I love to see that.
JERRY Shut up! Shut up Farfel, stop it! I don't know what to do. I mean what if I take it to the pound then the guy shows up?
ELAINE Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is.
JERRY No, I tried. they don't know anything. You gotta put the syrup in first.
ELAINE No, milk.
JERRY I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender.
ELAINE What is a bender anyhow?
JERRY I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar.
ELAINE I can't believe he hasn't called.
JERRY Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!
KRAMER Sorry, I can't watch the dog tonight.
JERRY Why?
ELAINE We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative.
KRAMER I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life.
JERRY You're breaking up?
KRAMER Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You know how there's some people you worry about whether you're going to hurt their feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to get it on video, watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho, yeah.
ELAINE Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did.
KRAMER Woah, you didn't like her?
ELAINE If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps.
JERRY I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.
KRAMER How come you never said anything?
JERRY You can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after they stop seeing them.
KRAMER I tell you.
JERRY You. I'm talking about people.
ELAINE Are we still going to the movies tonight?
JERRY No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me.
ELAINE Just me and George?
JERRY Sure.
ELAINE But we need you.
JERRY What do you need me for?
ELAINE Because... Yeah?
GEORGE Prognosis Negative!
ELAINE Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law. Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just put some newspapers down or something?
JERRY No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!
ELAINE Just me and George alone?
GEORGE Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha ha!!!
JERRY I can't go.
GEORGE Can't go, Why not?
JERRY Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.
GEORGE I thought Kramer was watching.
JERRY He's breaking up with his girlfriend tonight.
GEORGE Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down.
JERRY No, I don't want that smell in the house.
GEORGE You spritz a little Lysol on it.
JERRY No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk.
GEORGE So we're not going?
JERRY Nah. You two go.
GEORGE Oh. You still wanna go?
ELAINE Do you?
GEORGE If you want.
ELAINE It's up to you.
JERRY Go ahead.
ELAINE Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh, you wanna see Ponce de Leon?
GEORGE Ponce de Leon? Okay. You sure you don't wanna go?
JERRY I want to but I can't.
ELAINE Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can switch apartments for the night.
JERRY No.
GEORGE What about this--
JERRY Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time.
ELAINE I know, it's not that.
GEORGE It's just we want you to go.
JERRY Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath!
JERRY On my block, a lot of people walk their dogs, and I always see them walking along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest function of human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're gonna think the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's making a poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume was in charge?
GEORGE So how long did you live there?
ELAINE About three years.
GEORGE That's pretty long.
ELAINE Hmm.
GEORGE It's not that long, really.
ELAINE Yeah. An uncomfortable silence ensues. They both speak at the same time, then stop. Another silence.
GEORGE And then you came here.
ELAINE Yeah. So I've been here about six years.
GEORGE Eighty-six, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, ninety, ninety-one... Yup.
JERRY Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?!
KRAMER I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? Couldn't respect myself.
GEORGE I like herbal tea.
GEORGE Chamomile's good. Lemon Lift. Almond Pleasure.
ELAINE Jerry likes Morning Thunder.
GEORGE Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?
ELAINE Yeah.
GEORGE Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.
ELAINE Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.
GEORGE You don't tell him?
ELAINE No. And you should see him, man, he gets all hyper, he doesn't even know why, he loves it! He walks around, going, "God, I feel great!"
GEORGE You don't tell him?
ELAINE No.
GEORGE That is so funny!
ELAINE I know!
GEORGE Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!
KRAMER Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back, every word! I love you! I love you! I can't live without you, I'll do anything!
JERRY That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on Monday? Last Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable. Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much. That's it, Farfel! Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're checking out!
ELAINE It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one.
JERRY Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off.
ELAINE The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of you.
JERRY Hello? Aha! Boy George, about time. Beautiful, how soon? Okay, here's the plan. We take the dog to the pound, we go right to the movies. Right, you, me and Elaine. Yes, all three of us. I am going. Okay, see you in five minutes.
JERRY Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on down. What?
ELAINE Do you have to?
JERRY What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not sure this is a dog.
ELAINE You know, the guy might have just lost your number.
JERRY I'm in the book and I have a machine.
ELAINE Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them.
JERRY Really? How late are they open?
JERRY What?
ELAINE What is it?
KRAMER I went back with Ellen.
JERRY_AND_ELAINE Ohhhhh, that's great.
ELAINE Terrific.
JERRY Yeah, I really think you guys are good together.
ELAINE Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding.
KRAMER Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?
JERRY I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset.
KRAMER From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you don't know me.
ELAINE Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it.
JERRY What are you doing?
KRAMER I'm getting my pot.
ELAINE Kramer, we like her.
JERRY Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?
ELAINE I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.
JERRY I said, "How come no one's killed her?" Probably shouldn't have said anything, everyone knows the first break-up never takes. Yeah?
GEORGE Prognosis Negative!
JERRY Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on.
ELAINE Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault.
JERRY It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.
ELAINE Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight.
JERRY I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?
ELAINE We'll see it Sunday. George enters.
GEORGE Tonight's the night, right? Prognosis Negative?
ELAINE I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog.
GEORGE What does this mean?
JERRY Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De Leon.
GEORGE What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound.
JERRY She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
GEORGE Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?
JERRY I don't know, regular human time?
GEORGE Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?
JERRY Why shouldn't I go here?
ELAINE Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure you get your seats and then go to the bathroom.
GEORGE And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
ELAINE Yeah.
JERRY Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!
GEORGE Hey, go.
ELAINE Who's stopping you?
GEORGE What, are you doing me a favor?
ELAINE Like we care if you go to the bathroom.
GEORGE How's it going?
ELAINE Good. Good. You?
GEORGE Things are good.
ELAINE Boy, he takes such a long time.
GEORGE I know.
ELAINE You know what he does in there? He gargles.
GEORGE Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?
ELAINE Yeah, he does it like six times a day.
GEORGE How come we never hear him?
ELAINE Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this, watch.
GEORGE Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!
ELAINE We talked about that already.
GEORGE Oh.
GEORGE I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm out of conversation.
JERRY So what are calling me six times a day?
GEORGE All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get, I could always read the sports section.
JERRY I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.
GEORGE Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.
JERRY It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?
GEORGE Nothing except Prognosis Negative.
JERRY Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.
ELAINE Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with! When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!
ELAINE Shut up. Shut up! Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my god, the dog guy. Where have you been? Yeah, well you better pick up your dog tonight or he has humped his last leg.
GEORGE I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but it's this or nothing.
JERRY I don't know what to do.
GEORGE What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go.
JERRY I know, I know.
GEORGE So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy.
JERRY It is kind of silly.
GEORGE Of course it is.
JERRY I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake.
GEORGE Exactly.
JERRY It's not like she's in the movie.
GEORGE Right.
JERRY Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies.
GEORGE And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it.
JERRY How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is stupid, c'mon, let's just go.
GEORGE Good.
JERRY Saving movies.
GEORGE Ridiculous!
JERRY Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in trouble.
GEORGE Oh, you're dead.
GAVIN Bell's Palsy. The entire side of my, of, of my face was paralyzed. Farfel! I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't even feed myself, I was completely incapacitated. Quiet Farfel!
JERRY You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said you were released on Monday.
GAVIN Yes, yes, that's true, but then I was taken to the Bell's Palsy Center in, in, in, in Rockford. Absolutely first rate facility, top notch physicians.
KRAMER Hey, c'mon, c'mon, get off me!
GAVIN He won't hurt you, he's just playing.
KRAMER Hey you keep that mutt away from me.
GAVIN Mutt? I'll wager his parents are more pure than yours.
ELLEN Kramer, are you coming?
JERRY Oh, hi Ellen.
ELLEN Get in here.
JERRY Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week, but if you don't mind...
GAVIN Pre-prediction. You'll be calling me to ask if you can come and visit him before the month is out.
JERRY Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life. Farfel barks very loudly and pulls Gavin into the hallway and out of Jerry's apartment.
ELAINE We made plans.
JERRY Why don't we just rent a movie?
ELAINE I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.
JERRY No, it's supposed to be really bad, really bad. I mean it's long, there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard.
ELAINE Jerry, you promised me we'd go.
JERRY Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it.
ELAINE Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it.
JERRY You and George got together?
ELAINE Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about. Kramer enters.
JERRY Hello.
KRAMER Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.
JERRY What's up?
KRAMER Well, you were right.
JERRY About what?
KRAMER Ellen. We, uh, broke up again.
JERRY Too bad.
ELAINE I thought she was the one.
KRAMER I'll bring back the pot.
ELAINE Okay, c'mon it's movie time.
KRAMER Hey, what are you gonna see?
JERRY Prognosis Negative.
KRAMER Hey, that's supposed to be great.
JERRY It's not.
KRAMER How do you know?
JERRY I have an instinct for these things.
JERRY I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that I really enjoyed. We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and my mother had built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt this gives you a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes, "Hey look, there's a whole nother room in there. There's a guy in there looks just like me." But the parakeet will fall for this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, BANG! With his little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh! And I'd always think, even if he thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet?
JERRY So what happened to you yesterday? We were supposed to go to the auto show, I waited for you, you never came.
ELAINE I'm sorry, I got really busy. How long did you wait?
JERRY Five minutes.
ELAINE Five minutes? That's it?
JERRY What's the difference? You never showed up.
ELAINE I could've! I mean, last week we waited for that friend of Kramer's for like, forty minutes.
JERRY Well, we barely knew the guy.
ELAINE So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em.
JERRY That's the way it works.
ELAINE When did you tell George to be here?
JERRY I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been?
ELAINE About five.
JERRY That's enough.
GEORGE Early! Alright! Cold.
KRAMER So, I noticed you bounced a check at the bodega.
JERRY How did you know about that?
KRAMER Because Marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all the other bad checks.
JERRY He can't do that.
KRAMER It's the only way you'll learn. Aw, these eggs are disgusting. This chicken should be ashamed of himself.
GEORGE Fantastic day! Fantastic!
JERRY What happened?
GEORGE Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin, that must have been lodged in there for days, comes loose.
JERRY Fantastic.
GEORGE Then, I'm at The Foundation...
JERRY You're still doing that?
GEORGE Sometimes, once in a while.
JERRY When you feel guilty.
GEORGE No, occasionally I'll forget to let the machine pick up. Anyway, they made this large donation to a women's prison, and I get to go down there and check it out.
KRAMER That's caged heat.
GEORGE Yeah-hah!
JERRY What are you gonna do there?
GEORGE Nothing really, you know...just stroll around the cell blocks, maybe take in a shower fight. Hey, you know you got a bounced check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus?
JERRY Yes, I know, I know.
GEORGE I noticed you chose the "clowns with balloons" check design.
JERRY It was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones.
ELAINE Hey! Look who's here! Hey Kurt, this is Jerry, and George, and Kramer.
KRAMER Hey, Kurt. Taste these eggs.
KURT Uh, no - I only eat cage-free, farm-fresh.
KRAMER Yes! These are sweatshop eggs.
KURT I gotta call the office. Honey, would you order for me?
ELAINE I'm a "honey." He's pretty great, huh?
JERRY Is he from the future?
ELAINE No, he just shaves his head. I think it's pretty gutsy.
GEORGE Listen, sweetheart, let me tell you a little something about guts. This is guts.
ELAINE What? Clinging to some scraps?
GEORGE These are not "scraps." These are historic remains of a once great society of hair.
ELAINE Oh, did you guys stop at the bodega today? Some moron bounced a clown check!
JERRY Again, I'm really sorry about the check, Marcelino.
MARCELINO People seem to like the clowns.
JERRY Look, let me just give you the forty, plus another twenty for your trouble.
MARCELINO 'Kay.
JERRY Aren't you going to take the check down?
MARCELINO Sorry, no. It's store policy.
JERRY But it's your bodega.
MARCELINO Even I am not above the policy.
BETSY Those are our tennis courts.
GEORGE Tennis courts? What about the yard? Where do they have the gang fights?
BETSY There's no fights here, Mr. Costanza. This is a minimum security facility.
GEORGE Hmm. What about a hole? You ever put anybody in "the box"?
BETSY No.
GEORGE This prison stinks.
BETSY And finally, the library, which has just been refurbished thanks to your generous donation. This is Celia Morgan, our librarian.
CELIA Nice to meet you.
BETSY I'll be in my office if you need me.
GEORGE Thanks, Warden.
BETSY Betsy.
GEORGE Betsy.
CELIA So, are you the head of the foundation?
GEORGE Well, let's just say it wouldn't exist without me. So uh, you two shop at the same store?
CELIA No, it's standard issue.
GEORGE Oh my God...you're in jail? That is so cool!
JERRY You asked her out?
GEORGE Well...not "out." She's in prison.
JERRY How could you ask her out?
GEORGE Why not?
JERRY I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens because you didn't want to go over the bridge!
GEORGE That was different!
JERRY I'll say.
GEORGE Jerry, I like being with her. Plus, I know where she is all the time. I have relatively no competition. And you know how you live in fear of the pop-in?
JERRY The pop-in.
GEORGE Yeah, no pop-in, no "in the neighborhood," no "I saw your light was on." And the best part is, if things go really well...
JERRY Conjugal visit?
GEORGE Don't jinx it!
KRAMER Hey. What's up?
JERRY George is dating a convict.
KRAMER Oh? What's she in for?
GEORGE Embezzlement.
KRAMER Sounds like a nice girl. Hey Jerry, is it all right if I put some stuff in your fridge? 'Cause mine's full.
JERRY Yeah, sure. You don't even have a fridge, do you?
KRAMER Well, not here.
JERRY Kramer, wait a minute, what the hell is that?
KRAMER Well, it's chicken feed.
JERRY I sense something is afoot.
KRAMER Yeah, I bought a chicken.
GEORGE Allow me. Why?
KRAMER Cage-free, farm-fresh eggs.
JERRY Allow me. What are you, an idiot?
KURT Hold it, hold it, I got it. Catch.
ELAINE Hey, driver's licence. Oh...my God.
KURT What?
ELAINE Your hair. It's so thick and lustrous. I mean, it...it was.
KURT Well, it still is. I shave my head for my swim team. I just liked the way it looked, so I kept it.
ELAINE Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? With you under it?
JERRY Is that your "chicken" making all that noise?
KRAMER Oh, Jerry loves the morning.
JERRY Who?
KRAMER Little Jerry Seinfeld. I named my chicken after you.
JERRY Thanks, that's very sweet, but that is not a chicken.
KRAMER Of course it is. I picked it out myself.
JERRY Well, you picked out a rooster.
KRAMER Well, that would explain Little Jerry's poor egg production.
CELIA This was fun.
GEORGE Yeah. I had a great time.
GUARD Five minutes, Mr. Costanza.
GEORGE The whole hour just flew by.
GUARD I'll get that.
GEORGE Oh, thanks, Bobby. Well, I guess I'll see you in four days.
CELIA Go out and have a ball with the guys. I'll be waiting right here for you.
GEORGE Of course you will. You're the best.
JERRY Hello?
HELEN Jerry? Leo told us he saw your bounced check. Are you having money problems?
JERRY I'm not having money problems.
HELEN Enough with the comedy! You're very clever, you should look into advertising.
MORTY He never even called Ed Roydlick. They were looking for someone!
JERRY I'm not calling Ed Roydlick. I'm doing fine!
HELEN That's it. I'm going to send you fifty dollars.
JERRY You are not sending me fifty dollars!
HELEN We're sending you fifty dollars! Morty, get me an envelope.
JERRY I swear to God, if you send me fifty dollars, you are gonna be so sorry!
MORTY I don't see envelopes!
HELEN They're right in front of you! Oh, for heaven's sakes...
JERRY Ma! Ma! Ma!
GEORGE How're the folks?
JERRY Good.
GEORGE So? Movie tonight?
JERRY I thought you were going out with Celia.
GEORGE I did. I'm back. I love this relationship, I feel so liberated!
JERRY Having her in jail.
GEORGE The only thing that bothers me is that I'm just coming up with this now.
JERRY Yeah, dating a convicted felon. I don't know how you missed it.
ELAINE Here. Take a look at that.
JERRY Huh. Kurt's an organ donor.
ELAINE No! He's not bald. Look! He's got a full head of hair.
JERRY So he just shaves his head for no reason?
GEORGE That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it!
ELAINE And he's growing it in just for me. It's mine. It's all mine.
JERRY It's just hair.
ELAINE It's not just hair! Look!
JERRY It's brown.
ELAINE It's chestnut with auburn highlights!
JERRY So?
ELAINE You're not around women. You don't know how important a man's hair is. I'm sorry, George, but it's true.
GEORGE I knew it.
MARCELINO Hey, Kramer. Nice rooster. What's his name?
KRAMER Well, this is Little Jerry Seinfeld.
MARCELINO Little Jerry Seinfeld. Does he bounce checks?
KRAMER Look, can't you take Jerry's check down?
MARCELINO Sorry Kramer, can't help you.
MARCELINO I like the way he handles himself.
ELAINE Oh, it's coming in already! Wow, you have some very nice little seedlings here. Huh...
KURT What?
ELAINE Well, it doesn't seem to be coming in so good over here. Or here.
KURT What do you mean?
ELAINE Well, I don't know...how long have you been shaving your head for?
KURT About three years.
ELAINE Huh.
KURT Oh my God! I'm going bald!
CELIA George! I'm so glad to see you!
GEORGE Hey, I brought you some cigarettes. You buy yourself something nice.
CELIA Good news - I'm up for parole.
GEORGE Parole! That's dynamite!
JERRY So Marcelino's going to take down the check?
KRAMER Well, it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight.
JERRY Great! What?
KRAMER Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights in the back of his store.
JERRY Ah ha...
KRAMER So, he says if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins, the check comes down.
JERRY Kramer, cockfighting is illegal.
KRAMER Only in The United States.
JERRY It's inhumane!
KRAMER No, Jerry, it's not what you think it is.
JERRY It's two roosters peckin' at each other!
KRAMER What?
JERRY Yeah!
KRAMER Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like "American Gladiators."
JERRY No Kramer, Little Jerry could get hurt.
KRAMER Well, I left him with Marcelino!
KRAMER My Little Jerry!
JERRY Hey, did you get Little Jerry, is he ok?
KRAMER Well, he's more than O.K., he won!
JERRY You let him fight?
KRAMER I couldn't get there in time to stop it, but you should have seen Little Jerry, Jerry! Flappin' his wings and struttin' his stuff! He was peckin' and weavin' and bobbin' and talkin' trash! He didn't even have to touch him! The other rooster ran out of the ring. The whole fight lasted two seconds.
JERRY How long do they usually last?
KRAMER Five seconds. And Marcelino says he's taking your check down today.
JERRY Great!
KRAMER Hey.
GEORGE Celia's up for parole.
KRAMER Hey, Little Jerry won his cockfight.
GEORGE What?
KRAMER Who?
JERRY I'm too tired.
KRAMER ok, listen, I want you to come by later, alright? 'Cause we're having a victory party for Little Jerry.
JERRY Alright.
GEORGE It's over, Jerry. She's gettin' out.
JERRY Ah, I'm so sorry.
GEORGE She's been locked up for two years. She's gonna want to make up for lost time. Dinners. Movies. Talking...
JERRY In other words, a normal relationship.
GEORGE And that's no good. I've tried it straight, Jerry. We've all seen the results. For me, sick is the only way to go.
JERRY Well, she'll still be an ex-con.
GEORGE It's not the same.
JERRY Hey, if you two are meant to be together...I'm sure the cops'll pick her up on something.
ELAINE Kurt? What's with the sweats? Aren't we going out?
KURT I don't care.
ELAINE You, uh...got a big stain on your shirt.
KURT Yeah...meatball...fell out of my sandwich.
ELAINE You already ate?
KURT It's from yesterday.
MARCELINO Jerry! You missed a hell of a cockfight last night.
JERRY Then what is my check still doing up? We had a deal!
MARCELINO Now we have a new deal.
JERRY New deal?
MARCELINO When Little Jerry Seinfeld is mine, the check will be yours.
JERRY This is outrageous! Pack of Juicy Fruit.
MARCELINO 85 cents.
JERRY 85 cents? That is outrageous!
JERRY Kramer, Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld.
KRAMER Well, that's out of the question.
JERRY But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity.
KRAMER Yeah, if you got a loser. But Little Jerry was born to cockfight!
JERRY No, no more cockfighting. Let's just sell him to Marcelino the cockfighter and be done with it!
KRAMER You know, I think you're jealous.
JERRY Of what?
KRAMER Yah, yah! You see in Little Jerry Seinfeld the unlimited future you once had. Now, just because Jerry Seinfeld is a has-been, don't make Little Jerry Seinfeld a never-was!
JERRY Kramer, give me that rooster!
KRAMER Never! You hate him because he's doing more with your name than you ever will! Yah-yah!
BETSY George, Celia has listed you as a character reference. Whatever you can tell us would certainly be helpful in her getting paroled.
GEORGE Well, anything I can do to help, um...she's a wonderful girl. Very smart. Very...crafty.
BETSY Does she have any plans after she's released?
GEORGE Plans. Schemes. She keeps talking about getting back together with her old friends - "the gang," as she likes to call them, you know. Yeah, they're hatching something, you can count on that.
MARCELINO Jerry! Tonight's fight-night. Where's my rooster?
JERRY Kramer won't sell.
MARCELINO Well, tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take down your check anyway.
JERRY Well, thank you, Marcelino.
MARCELINO Well, perhaps someday you will do me a favor. And that day is today. Little Jerry Seinfeld must go down in the third round of tomorrow's main event.
JERRY You want Little Jerry to take a dive?
MARCELINO Shhh, not so loud.
JERRY First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive.
MARCELINO Can, too!
JERRY Second of all, Jerry Seinfeld - big or little - doesn't go down for anyone, anywhere, at anytime! Now I'd appreciate it if you please leave.
MARCELINO Big Jerry is making a big mistake, Jerry.
JERRY We'll see about that. Kramer, I'm comin' up! We got a cockfight to win!
KRAMER ok!
KURT Elaine said you would be the best person I could talk to.
GEORGE Yep. Classic horseshoe pattern. I've seen a lot of this.
KURT Oh, God.
GEORGE No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now.
KURT Happy? Why should I be happy?
GEORGE You've still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances beyond this perimeter - - then you won't be Kurt anymore.
KURT Who will I be?
KURT How long do I have?
GEORGE 14 months. Maybe 10.
KURT Is there anything I can do?
GEORGE Yes. Live, dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is. Excuse me.
GEORGE Celia? What are you doing here?
CELIA Well, I didn't get my parole, so I busted out.
GEORGE And you just decided to pop in...!
ELAINE Kurt!
KURT Elaine... Will you marry me?
KRAMER Oh, yeah. He's lookin' good, huh Jerry?
JERRY Yeah. Alright, I think that's enough for today. Little Jerry is lean, mean, peckin' machine! What are you doing with that?
KRAMER I'm just gonna heat this up. Make a little hot-tub for Little Jerry.
JERRY Hey, Kramer...?
JERRY Be careful. Hey, guess what! Little Jerry ran from here to Newman's in under thirty seconds!
GEORGE Is that good?
JERRY I don't know. Where have you been?
GEORGE Celia broke out of prison. I'm sitting in my home, she shows up at the door!
JERRY Oh my God! The break-out/pop-in!
GEORGE Yeah. Hey Jerry, listen to this. I discovered something even better than conjugal visit sex. Fugitive sex! Now, it's like everytime -
JERRY George, this is a little too much for me - escaped convicts, fugitive sex...I got a cockfight to focus on.
ELAINE Hey Kurt, slow down! I just can't marry you, whim-bam-boom! I mean, I need some "fiance-time," I need some "make-my-girlfriends-jealous" time...
KURT Plus, you want to get to know me.
ELAINE Yeah, yeah, that too.
KURT Well, how much time?
ELAINE I don't know...a year?
KURT No, no, no...it has to be now.
ELAINE Could I see the ring again?
JERRY So, you're actually considering it?
ELAINE Well, it'll be a couple of years before he's completely bald. Those'll be good times.
JERRY Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change.
ELAINE Jerry, it's three-thirty in the morning. I'm at a cockfight. What am I clinging to?
GEORGE Hey, sorry I'm late.
JERRY Where's Celia?
GEORGE She didn't want to come, she's not really into sports.
JERRY Hey, how's he doin'?
KRAMER He's got a big sweat going. Oh, this came for you express-mail. It's from your parents.
JERRY Fifty dollars. I don't believe this!
KRAMER There's Marcelino.
JERRY Look at the size of his bird!
KRAMER That looks like a dog with a glove on his head.
KURT Hi, is George back from the cockfight yet? You know, I gotta thank him, he changed my life.
CELIA No, it must have been a good fight, he's not back yet.
KURT Ah, damn.
DETECTIVE_1 Sorry to bother you, Mr. Costanza. Well, well, well. Look who's here.
CELIA Aw, man!
DETECTIVE_2 Mr. Costanza, you're under arrest for aiding and abetting a known fugitive.
KURT I'm not George Costanza.
DETECTIVE_2 Save it. We know you're bald. We know it's you. Let's go!
ELAINE Muchos gracias. O.K., I got the whole scoop. Marcelino flew the bird in from Ecuador. He's 68 and 0!
JERRY He's a ringer!
GEORGE Where's the tamale guy?
KRAMER Little Jerry's going to get his clock cleaned. I gotta get him outta there.
KRAMER Little Jerry!
JERRY Kramer!
ELAINE Stop the fight!
GEORGE Tamale!
ELAINE Why did you get into a fist fight with the cop? You were innocent!
KURT They thought I was George. I'm not that bald. I have too little time left to take that kind of crap, so I slugged him.
ELAINE So, how long are you gonna be in here for?
KURT Well, my lawyer says 14 months, but with good behavior, maybe...10?
ELAINE So, 10 to 14 months.
KURT Yeah.
KRAMER Hey! You're back!
JERRY Oh, I'm back, baby.
KRAMER Yeah, how was it?
JERRY Great. One of the best jobs I ever had.
KRAMER Good for you.
JERRY I killed.
KRAMER You killed.
JERRY Slaughtered. Wiped the floor with 'em and not only that, the money was unbelievable.
KRAMER Unbelievable.
JERRY Yeah. Highest paying job I ever had.
KRAMER How much?
JERRY Nah, nah. I'd rather...
KRAMER Aw, c'mon.
JERRY Nah. It's not good for friends to talk about money, it can affect the friendship.
KRAMER I tell you how much I make.
JERRY And I'm always impressed.
KRAMER Just show me the cheque, c'mon.
JERRY Awright, fine. You wanna see it?
KRAMER I wanna see it.
JERRY Okay.
JERRY Here, check that out.
KRAMER Whuf! This is unbelievable.
JERRY I told you.
KRAMER My god, you're rich.
JERRY Oh yeah.
KRAMER I didn't know you made that kinda money. Jeez.
JERRY What?
KRAMER I don't think I can talk to you any more. I feel inferior.
JERRY I never shoulda told you.
KRAMER You know, Jerry, I think this changes the relationship. I mean, I feel it. Do you feel it?
JERRY No, I can't feel anything.
KRAMER Well, what're you gonna do with all that money?
JERRY Actually, I was thinking of donating a large portion of it to charity.
KRAMER Really?
JERRY No.
KRAMER Well, you should, Jerry.
JERRY No, to tell you the truth, I was thinking of buying my father a new car.
KRAMER Now, you see, that's nice.
JERRY Maybe a Cadillac.
KRAMER Cadillac. Ooh-la-la.
JERRY Yeah. That would really blow his mind. He's always wanted one, his whole life, he's never been able to afford it. I'm gonna do it.
KRAMER You're gonna score some big points with the man upstairs on this one.
JERRY Oh, isn't that what it's all about?
ELAINE Who was Pippi Longstocking?
KATY Pippi Longstocking? Hmm, I don't don't know.
ELAINE Did she have anything to do with Hitler?
KATY Hitler? Maybe.
GEORGE Hey.
ELAINE Hey George.
GEORGE Have you seen Jerry? I told him two o'clock.
ELAINE You remember Katy?
GEORGE Mm? Oh, hi. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We met uh, skiing that time. You're uh, married to the eye guy.
KATY Also ear, nose and throat.
GEORGE Nose. What's the worst that can happen to a nose? What does it get? Stuffed?
KATY He's funny.
ELAINE Ah, you don't have to tell me.
GEORGE Ahh, ladies, please, please.
ELAINE Oh, you know what? He got engaged.
KATY Oh, you did? Oh.
GEORGE What? Is that bad?
KATY I actually would've set you up with a friend of mine.
GEORGE Oh-ho, yeah?
KATY You'd be perfect for her. She loves quirky, funny guys.
GEORGE Bald? Uh?
KATY Loves bald.
GEORGE Loves bald? Wow. Who uh, who is she?
KATY Marisa Tomei.
GEORGE The actress?
KATY Yeah.
GEORGE You're friends with Marisa Tomei?
KATY That's right.
GEORGE That's, that's incredible. My Cousin Vinnie, I love her, she was fantastic!
KATY Yeah, I know.
GEORGE You were gonna fix me up with her?
KATY Yeah, she's just been sitting home.
GEORGE Marisa Tomei's sitting home, Elaine! Wh..why didn't you tell me that Katy was friends with Marisa Tomei?!
ELAINE Oh, I don't know what I was thinking.
JERRY I want this baby fully loaded. Well, how soon can you get it there? Oh, that's terrific. Okay, thanks, bye.
JERRY Hey, guess what. I just bought my father a Cadillac
GEORGE Really? Wow, you're quite the good son.
JERRY Yeah, I'm a very good boy. I'm flying down there and surprising him.
GEORGE You gonna sleep on the fold-out?
JERRY Yeah, yes.
GEORGE Uh, let me ask you something. You uh, you ever hear of Marisa Tomei?
JERRY The actress?
GEORGE Yeah. She's uh, she's something, isn't she?
JERRY Oh yeah.
GEORGE Well, you know Katy, Elaine's friend?
JERRY Yeah?
GEORGE She happens to be very good friends with her.
JERRY Marisa Tomei?
GEORGE Uh-hmm.
JERRY How does she know Marisa Tomei?
GEORGE I don't know, I didn't ask.
JERRY You didn't ask how she knows Marisa Tomei?
GEORGE Not the point!
JERRY Alright.
GEORGE Can I finish?
JERRY Go ahead. Seems like a reasonable question, is all I'm saying. I would've asked her.
GEORGE Alright! So, she said, that she could've fixed me up with her.
JERRY What d'you mean, could've?
GEORGE Well, you know, if I uh, wasn't engaged.
JERRY Ohh!
GEORGE Coulda fixed me up with Marisa Tomei. She said I was just her type!
JERRY Really? Jerry puts a scoop of ice cream on the pie.
GEORGE Yeah. Yeah. You know the odds of me being anyone's type?! I have never been anyone's type, but apparently, this Marisa Tomei loves funny, quirky, bald men.
JERRY You know, she won an academy award?
GEORGE Hu-hu, like I don't know that? My Cousin Vinnie, I love that! I, George Costanza, could be on a date with an Oscar winner! An Oscar winner, Jerry! You know what that's like? It's like if fifty years ago, someone fixed me up with Katherine Hepburn? Same thing!
JERRY Now there's a match. You and Katherine Hepburn.
GEORGE I mean, you've seen her, right?
JERRY Katherine Hepburn? Oh yeah.
GEORGE Marisa Tomei!
JERRY Yeah, yeah, yeah.
GEORGE I mean, she's beautiful, right? She's just my type. The dark hair, the full lips.
JERRY You like full lips.
GEORGE Oh, I love full lips. Something you can really put the lipstick on. The two sit on the couch.
JERRY Mmm-mmm. Too bad you're engaged. Jerry takes a mouthful of pie.
GEORGE Yeah, too bad. Too bad.
JERRY This is no good.
JERRY Hi.
NICK Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm uh, I'm with Plaza Cable. I'm sorry to bother you. I...I'm looking for the guy who lives over here. Been waiting about uh, heh, two hours. You uh, happen to know where he is?
JERRY No.
NICK If you see him, Could you just tell him the cable company was here?
JERRY Sure.
NICK Thanks.
JERRY Nice people.
GEORGE Listen, lemme ask you a question. What if I got a cup of coffee with her?
JERRY Well, what about Susan?
GEORGE I can't have a cup of coffee with a person?! I'm not allowed to have coffee?!
JERRY Would you tell Susan about it?
GEORGE Not necessarily.
JERRY Well, if you can't tell Susan about it, then there's something wrong.
GEORGE Of course there's something wrong! We had a pact!
JERRY Hey, cable guy's looking for you.
KRAMER Oh, yeah?
JERRY Yeah.
KRAMER Oh. Yeah, I been getting HBO and Showtime for free. See, they just found out about it, so now they wanna come and take it out.
JERRY Well, said he was waiting about two hours. Seemed a little put out.
KRAMER Oh, was he? Was he? I guess the cable man doesn't like to be kept waiting.
JERRY You don't seem too bothered by it.
KRAMER You remember what they did to me ten years ago? "Oh, we'll be there in the morning between nine and one", or "We'll be there between two and six"! And I sat there, hour after hour, without so much as a phone call. Finally, they show up, no apology, tracking mud all over my nice clean floors. Now, they want me to accommodate them. Well, looks like the shoe's on the other foot, doesn't it?
JERRY Boy, I've never seen you like this.
KRAMER Oh, you don't wanna get on my bad side.
MARISA ...positrack, which was not available on the sixty-four Buick Skylark.
SUSAN Hey. Hey what're you watching? What is that? My Cousin Vinnie?
GEORGE Yeah.
SUSAN I thought you saw that before. How come you're watching that again?
GEORGE I..I..I dunno.
SUSAN Did you know Marisa Tomei won an Oscar for that? Boy, she's beautiful, don't you think? I wish I looked like that.
SUSAN Turn it off. You're making me jealous. I'm gonna think you like her more than you like me.
GEORGE Ha, ha.
ELAINE Hello.
GEORGE Elaine, it's me, George.
ELAINE George. How come you're whispering?
GEORGE Never mind, never mind. I need you to do me a favour. Uhm, remember what we were talking about at the coffee shop earlier?
ELAINE No.
GEORGE Think, a second. You know, your friend was talking about me and, you know...
ELAINE Ech, George, I have no idea what you're talking about.
GEORGE The actress.
ELAINE What?
GEORGE Marisa Tomei!
SUSAN What?
GEORGE Uh, ah, nothing. Nothing.
ELAINE Oh, yeah. Yeah, what about her?
GEORGE Well, uhm, I think I'd like to do it.
ELAINE What? What?! George, no way. You're engaged!
GEORGE A cup of coffee. That, that doesn't mean anything.
ELAINE Uhh. No George!
GEORGE Elaine.
ELAINE Forget it!
GEORGE Elaine! Elaine!
GEORGE D'oh...Oh, oh, the judge! I hate this guy!
ELAINE I can't believe you're buying your father a car.
JERRY And, best of all, it's a Cadillac.
ELAINE Hoh. A Cadillac! Wow. I had no idea you had this kind of money.
JERRY Ahh, I uh, I don't like to talk about it.
ELAINE Yeah, I thought you were doing okay. I just didn't think you were in this kind of, you know, uh... position.
JERRY Ah, it's just money.
ELAINE So, when're you getting back from Florida?
JERRY Oh, I don't know, play it by ear. Why?
ELAINE I don't know. Just, things seem a little more exciting when you're around. That's all.
JERRY Are you okay?
ELAINE Sure, sure.
JERRY What was that?
KRAMER Quiet, quiet.
NICK Hey, uh, you know the guy who lives here?
GEORGE Yeah.
NICK All morning I been waiting here. All morning. The guy says he's gonna be home. I show up and all I do is wait. I'm getting pretty sick and tired of it. I'm not gonna put up with it much longer.
KRAMER I'm loving this.
GEORGE Kramer, there's a guy out here that...
KRAMER Yeah, yeah. I know, I know.
GEORGE Oh. Thanks very much for yesterday, by the way.
ELAINE Jerry, he want me to fix him up with Marisa Tomei. I am not gonna be a part of this!
GEORGE Fixed up? A cup of coffee! A cup of coffee is not a fix up!
ELAINE You wanna meet her. You wanna see if she likes you?
GEORGE So what? So what if I do?
ELAINE You're engaged!
GEORGE I'm aware! I'm aware!! But this is Marisa Tomei, Elaine. An Oscar winner! How can I live the rest of my life, knowing I coulda been with Marisa Tomei? She said I was just her type! She loves short, stocky, balding funny men!
JERRY I notice you threw 'stocky' in there.
GEORGE Yeah, what the hell?!
ELAINE George! It's cheating.
GEORGE It's not cheating if there's no sex!
ELAINE Yes it is!
GEORGE Ahh!
ELAINE Jerry!
JERRY Uhm, hold, hold on a second. I'm, I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said.
GEORGE Elaine, c'mon. Would you just make the call? Please, make the call.
ELAINE Yeah, yeah, fine, I'll make...
GEORGE Alright.
ELAINE Eight-fifty.
JERRY Oh, right.
ELAINE So uh, how are you getting to the airport? D'you need a ride, or...
JERRY No, don't be silly, I've arranged a car.
ELAINE You sure? You sure? 'Cos, you know...
JERRY Maybe I'll let you pick me up.
ELAINE Okay.
ELAINE Oh, hi. Uhm, is Katy there? Wh...? Uhm, what? Oh, really?
ELAINE Well, could you tell her Elaine called? Yeah, thanks.
ELAINE Huh, she's in the hospital. She has an arrhythmia.
GEORGE What about Marisa Tomei?!
HELEN Morty, what d'you have to open this box for?
MORTY I wanted a Chip Ahoy.
HELEN I don't like all these open boxes.
MORTY Look, I got a few good years left. If I want a Chip Ahoy, I'm having it.
JERRY Surprise!
MORTY Jerry!
HELEN Oh, my god!
MORTY What the hell are you doing here?
JERRY I'm a good son.
HELEN Just like that? No calls?
JERRY Just like that.
MORTY Boy, you are really something.
HELEN To what do we owe this great honour?
JERRY You wanna know? Come on outside.
MORTY Outside? What's going on?
HELEN Whenever Jerry comes, something exciting happens.
MORTY Heh hah!
JERRY C'mon, c'mon.
JERRY Well, what d'you think?
MORTY Look at this! Look at this! You bought a Cadillac?!
JERRY I bought it for you. It's yours.
MORTY You what? You bought me a Cadillac?
JERRY I bought you a Cadillac. Here you go.
HELEN Are you out of your mind?
JERRY What?
MORTY You don't want it? Are you kidding?
HELEN He's not buying us a Cadillac.
MORTY What are you, nuts?
HELEN It's a very nice gesture Jerry, but take it back.
MORTY Can you believe this?!
HELEN I'm not letting him buy us a Cadillac. He hasn't got that kind of money.
JERRY How d'you know?
HELEN Oh, get out of here Mister Big Shot.
JERRY Why can't I buy my father a car?
HELEN Your father doesn't need a car.
MORTY Yes, I do! Morty grabs the keys back from Jerry.
HELEN Oh, Morty.
MORTY We're keeping it.
HELEN Over my dead body.
JERRY Well, this worked out just as I had hoped.
MACHINE Giddyup.
NICK Yeah, this is Nick Stevens, from Plaza Cable.
NICK Well, I waited all morning again. You said you were gonna be there from nine to one.
NICK I was there. Where were you? You think I got nothing better to do than stand outside all morning, waiting for you to show up?!
NICK You're not gonna get away with this!
MORTY Hey Jerry, look at this. My seat's got a memory, in case somebody moves it. I could be in prison for five years. I come out, my seat goes right back to where I like it.
JERRY That's what I was thinking.
JACK Hello, Jerry.
JERRY Hiya, Jack.
MORTY So, how d'you like this?
JACK Who's car?
MORTY It's mine.
JACK Yours?
MORTY That's right. My son bought it for me.
JACK He what?
MORTY My son bought me the car. It's a present.
JACK You bought it?
JERRY That's right. I bought it.
MORTY You ever see one so nice?
JACK Some car.
MORTY You wanna take a ride?
JACK No, thank you.
MORTY C'mon, take a ride.
JACK I don't wanna take a ride.
MORTY Why not?
JACK I don't feel like taking a ride. Do I have to take a ride?!
JERRY He doesn't wanna take a ride.
MORTY Uh huh.
JACK What d'you think? I've never ridden in a Cadillac before? Believe me, I've ridden in a Cadillac hundreds of times. Thousands.
MORTY Thousands?!
JACK What? D'you think you're such a big shot now, because you got a Cadillac?
MORTY Ahh!
JACK Yaah! Jack angrily stalks away.
MORTY Could you believe that guy?
JERRY Aahh!
GEORGE Anyway, I was thinking about what you said. About uh, me and Marisa.
GEORGE You know, about the uh, two of us getting together. And I know that I said I was engaged, but uh, you know, it's really just something you say. It's like, going steady. You know uh, going steady, engaged, it's, it's all just stuff you say. Anyway, I was watching uh, My Cousin Vinnie, on the uh, on the tape the other day, and I was thinking that uh, you know, the two of us might take a meeting, as they say. So, what d'you, what d'you think?
GEORGE Move a pinkie, if it's yes. Can you move a pinkie?
KRAMER Y'hello.
NICK Hi, uh ah, Mister Kramer, ah, this is McNab down at the phone company. We've got a report about some trouble on your line.
KRAMER Hmm. Well, I haven't had any trouble.
NICK Uh, the thing is, we happen to have a man right in your neighbourhood.
KRAMER Ohh, is that right? Well, I have been having a little trouble with my call-waiting.
NICK We can fix that. We can fix that.
KRAMER Oh, can you? That's funny, because, as it happens, I don't have call-waiting. Seems to me that the phone company would know that.
NICK Oh, right. I'm sorry, I was looking at the wrong work order.
KRAMER Yeah. Could you hold on for a second? I've got something on the stove.
KRAMER Hey, McNab!
KRAMER Chunnel's on HBO tonight. Why don't you stop by?
MORTY Alright. Next thing on the agenda, the restoration of the fence at the Briarwood gate. At the present time, we are still accepting bids.
HERB C'mon Morty, it's been broken for six months already. What the hell are you doing?
MORTY Well, I, as your president, have to find the best price, and right now, I for one, do not think it's cost-feasible.
JACK I'll bet you don't.
MORTY What was that?
JACK C'mon Morty, the jig is up!
MORTY What're you talking about?
JACK I'm sorry. I'm sitting here, the whole meeting, holding my tongue. I've known you a long time, Morty, but I cannot hold it in any longer.
HERB What's going on, Jack?
JACK I'll tell you what's going on. Morty Seinfeld has been stealing funds from the treasury.
MORTY Stealing?!
RALPH What proof do you have?
JACK Proof? You want proof? He's driving around in a brand new Cadillac. Now what more proof do you want?
MORTY My son bought me that car!
JACK Your son?
MORTY Yeah.
JACK Your son could never afford that car. We all saw his act, last year, at the playhouse. He's lucky he can pay his rent!
HERB Jack's right! He stinks!
RALPH It's his material.
MORTY I tell you, he bought it for me!
HERB I move for a full investigation!
RALPH I second.
MARISA ...go introduce myself.
SUSAN Hey! What're you watching? Only You? That's another Marisa Tomei movie, and you've seen that one too. What, d'you have a thing for her?
GEORGE Yeah, yeah. I have a thing for Marisa Tomei. Like she would ever go out with a short, stocky, bald man. Hu hu, ha ha. Like that's her type. Huh. She's an Oscar winner. He heh. Besides, I don't even know her. It's not like anyone's trying to fix us up. Who, who would try and fix me up with Marisa Tomei?
SUSAN What are you talking about?
MARISA Have I told you how much I love you today?
GEORGE Not in the last fifteen minutes.
MARISA Well, I do love you very much.
GEORGE And I love you, Marisa.
MARISA Well then, c'mon, get dressed. We're going to be late for the premiere.
HELEN Impeachment?
MORTY That's right. Have you ever heard of anything like that?
HELEN Can they do that?
MORTY If they get the votes.
HELEN I told you we shouldn't have let him give us the car.
JERRY Didn't you tell 'em I got the bill of sale? That proves I paid for it.
MORTY It doesn't make a difference. They think we're in cahoots.
JERRY You know, you could put a fence around these condos, and call it an insane asylum. Nobody would know the difference!
MORTY No-one's ever been impeached before. I couldn't live here. We'd have to move to Boca.
EVELYN Hello?
JERRY Oh, hi Evelyn. Morty sits by the table.
EVELYN Hello, Jerry. I just got off the phone with Saul Brandus.
HELEN What'd he say?
EVELYN He's voting to impeach.
EVELYN Not because he think you stole the money, but mainly because you never thanked him for giving you his aisle seat at Freddy Roman's show.
MORTY I did so thank him!
HELEN No, he never heard you. I told you he didn't hear you.
MORTY Ah, he's deaf anyway.
EVELYN Now, my sources tell me, there's three votes for impeachment, three votes against impeachment, and one undecided.
MORTY Who's that?
EVELYN Mrs Choate.
JERRY Who's she?
MORTY Oh, that one. She's been a member of the board longer than anybody. She's very tough to deal with.
HELEN Maybe we should have her over for coffee, and explain our side of it?
MORTY That's a good idea.
EVELYN Okay. I'll see you at the Lichtenberg's, tonight.
HELEN The Lichtenberg's?
EVELYN Yes, they're having a party.
HELEN We weren't invited.
EVELYN Oh. Probably they think you're too good for them. You know, because of the car.
GEORGE Well... it's a magnificent stone.
MR._ROSS They put it up this morning.
GEORGE It's just a magnificent stone. Jerry?
MRS._ROSS George... we'll leave you alone with her.
GEORGE What?
MRS._ROSS I'm sure there are things you'd like to say.
GEORGE No, I'm good. Really.
GEORGE Jerry...
JERRY Thank you, no.
GEORGE ...And then, right after the All-Star Break, we, we just swept the Orioles. Four games. In Baltimore. So... yeah.
GEORGE Boy, that was awkward!
JERRY I don't mind the cemetery.
GEORGE What were you saying to the Rosses over there, anyway?
JERRY Oh, I don't know. I told them her death takes place in the shadow of new life. She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her.
GEORGE What is that?
JERRY Star Trek II.
GEORGE Wrath of Khan!
JERRY Right. Kramer and I saw it last night. Spock dies, they wrap him up in a towel, and they shoot him out the bowel of the ship in that big sunglasses case.
GEORGE That was a hell of a thing when Spock died...
JERRY Yeah...
GEORGE Well anyway, the, uh... the stone is up, I paid my respects, guess that's it.
JERRY So it's over?
GEORGE I have mourned for three long months! Summer months, too! Anybody could grieve in January! It's time for George to start being George again.
JERRY All right, so uh, let's do something later. How 'bout a movie?
GEORGE Yes! Nothing says George like a movie!
KRAMER Movie?
JERRY Yeah, you in?
KRAMER No, no, no, I can't. I got my martial arts class.
GEORGE George is going to the movies!
JERRY So how's your karate class going?
KRAMER Karate, Jerry. Karate. The lifetime pursuit of balance and harmony.
JERRY ...But with punching and kicking.
KRAMER Jerry, karate is not here . It's here , and here , and here .
JERRY Alright, I gotta go to the airport to pick up Elaine.
KRAMER What, she's been away?
JERRY She's been in Mexico for six weeks.
KRAMER No, I really think you're wrong. We just went to the fireworks the other day.
JERRY That was July 4th!
JERRY Alright, I'm outta here, and when I get back, I don't want to see you here , here , or here .
ELAINE It was unbelievable. Six weeks of traveling through Mexico all on Peterman's peso.
JERRY Wow. So did you get any good ideas for the catalog?
ELAINE Oh, tons!
JERRY Anything you couldn't have gotten tearing open a bag of Doritos and watching Viva Zapata?
ELAINE You don't respect my work at all, do you?
JERRY No, I don't.
ELAINE So what's been going on around this dump? How's your fiancee?
JERRY My what?
ELAINE Jeannie... your fiancee.
JERRY Oh, yeah, that. Well...
ELAINE All right. Spill it, Jerome.
JERRY There's really not that much to tell. "About a month ago, we were here having lunch, when all of a sudden we both just blurted out..."
JERRY_AND_JEANNIE I hate you!
JEANNIE See ya.
JERRY See ya. "It was unprecendented. I mean, it was the first truly mutual breakup in relationship history."
JERRY No rejection, no guilt, no remorse.
ELAINE You've never felt remorse.
JERRY I know, I feel bad about that...
ELAINE I bet your parents were upset, huh?
JERRY Eh.
ELAINE You haven't told them yet, have you?
JERRY No.
DUGAN "So I pressed through the rushes, there below me, the shimmering waters of Lake Victoria..."
J._PETERMAN Oh, for the love of God, man! Just tell me what the product is.
DUGAN It's a, uh, washcloth.
J._PETERMAN No washcloths!
ELAINE Well, Mr. Peterman, I've got a really good idea for a hat. It combines the spirit of old Mexico with a little big city panache. I like to call it the Urban Sombrero.
J._PETERMAN Oh, my neck is one gargantuan monkey fist.
ELAINE Are you okay, Mr. Peterman?
J._PETERMAN Yes, yes. Go on, go on, go on.
ELAINE Well, see, it's... businessmen taking siestas. You know, it's the, uh, the Urban Sombrero.
ELAINE Mr. Peterman?
GEORGE I tell you, Jerry, I'm feeling something. Something I haven't felt in a long time.
JERRY Pride?
GEORGE No. Autonomy, complete and total autonomy.
JERRY Well, you're your own boss now.
GEORGE I wanna go to a tractor pull.
JERRY Go ahead.
GEORGE I am staying out all night!
JERRY Who's stopping you?
GEORGE I wanna bite into a big hunk of cheese, just bite into it like it's an apple.
JERRY Whatever.
JERRY Oh God.
GEORGE What?
JERRY It's Dolores.
GEORGE Who?
JERRY Mulva.
DOLORES Jerry, hi.
JERRY Hi, Dolores. George, you remember Dolores?
GEORGE Dolores!
DOLORES Hi. I heard you got engaged.
JERRY Yes, Dolores, I did. It didn't work out, though, Dolores.
DOLORES Oh, that's too bad. You know... we should get together sometime. See ya.
JERRY See ya.
GEORGE Bye, Dolores.
GEORGE I thought Mulva hated you.
JERRY Yeah, so did I. You know what? I bet it was the engagement. I've shown I can go all the way.
GEORGE All the way?
JERRY Not our "all the way", their "all the way." I got the stink of responsibility on me.
GEORGE Yeah, and you were engaged for like a minute, I was engaged for a year.
JERRY You stink worse than I do!
GEORGE I'm feeling something else here, Jerry!
SECRETARY Elaine, it's Mr. Peterman on the phone.
ELAINE Hello, Mr. Peterman, how are you feeling?
J._PETERMAN Elaine, I'll be blunt. I'm burnt out. I'm fried. My mind is as barren as the surface of the moon. I can run that catalog no longer.
ELAINE What? Well, who's gonna do it?
J._PETERMAN What about you?
ELAINE Me? Why me?
J._PETERMAN Why, indeed.
ELAINE Mr. Peterman, you can't leave.
J._PETERMAN I've already left, Elaine. I'm in Burma.
ELAINE Burma?
J._PETERMAN You most likely know it as Myanmar, but it will always be Burma to me. Bonne chance, Elaine. You there on the motorbike! Sell me one of your melons!
ELAINE Mr. Peterman?
JERRY Where?
ELAINE Burma.
JERRY Isn't it Myanmar now?
ELAINE Jerry, he wants me to run the catalog! It's crazy! I can't be in charge!
JERRY No, certainly not.
ELAINE I mean, I can't give people orders!
JERRY No one's gonna listen to you.
ELAINE I am not qualified to run the catalog!
JERRY You're not qualified to work at the catalog.
KRAMER Hey. What's wrong?
ELAINE Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma, and now he wants me to run the catalog.
KRAMER Where?
JERRY Myanmar.
KRAMER The discount pharmacy?
ELAINE Well, I'm just gonna tell him no. I can't run the catalog.
KRAMER Whoa, whoa. Can't? When did that word enter your vocabulary? What, is the job too difficult? What, you don't have enough experience? Oh, you're not smart enough? Where's your confidence? Look, Elaine, let me tell you a story. When I first studied karate...
ELAINE Karate?
KRAMER Yeah, karate. I had no support. Not from him, not from Newman, no one. The first time I sparred with an opponent, I was terrified. My legs, they were like noodles. But then I looked inside, and I found my katra.
ELAINE Katra?
KRAMER Yeah, your spirit, your, uh, being. The part of you that says, "Yes, I can!"
JERRY Sammy Davis had it.
KRAMER So I listened to my katra and now I'm dominating the dojo. I'm class champion.
ELAINE Well, you know, I, I have watched Peterman run the company.
KRAMER Sure you have.
ELAINE I know how to do it. Pair of pants, a stupid story, a huge markup. I can do that.
KRAMER You follow your katra, and you can do anything. Now get out of here.
ELAINE Okay.
KRAMER That kid is gonna be all right.
JERRY No, she's not.
JOEY Come on, Kramer!
KRAMER Hey there.
JOEY Come on. Mom's down in the car.
KRAMER Okay, Joey.
JERRY You guys both have class at the same time?
KRAMER No, we're in the same class.
JERRY What do you mean you're in the same class?
KRAMER He almost beat me.
JERRY Kramer, you're fighting children?!
KRAMER We're all at the same skill level, Jerry.
JERRY He's nine years old! You don't need karate, you can just wring his neck!
KRAMER I got carpool.
KRAMER Thanks for the juice box, Mrs. Z.
JOEY Hey, could we stop for ice cream on the way home, mom?
MRS._ZANFINO Mmm, I don't know...
MRS._ZANFINO All right.
KIDS_AND_KRAMER Yay!
DUGAN You're taking the job?
ELAINE You got that straight. Now I want four new ideas from each of you by 6:00. No, make that six ideas by 4:00. All right, let's move, move, move, move, move!
SENSEI Are you prepared for kumite?
KRAMER_AND_JOEY Yes, sensei.
SENSEI Fight stance.
SENSEI Hydjama! Begin!
SENSEI Winner!
GEORGE It's open!
GEORGE Rosses.
MRS._ROSS Hello, George.
GEORGE Well, uh... come in, come, come in.
MR._ROSS We, uh, tried to call, but the line was busy.
GEORGE Oh. Oh. Yeah, sure. Here. Uh, sit down. Uh, uh, cheese, there?
MRS._ROSS We know the last three months have been hard on you.
GEORGE Oh, yes, yes, yes. Very, very hard.
MR._ROSS And they've been hard on us, too. It's a terrible tragedy when parents outlive their children.
GEORGE Yes, I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do.
MR._ROSS That's why we decided to create a foundation to preserve Susan's memory.
GEORGE Oh, that's wonderful. Mr. Ross. And, of course, we want you to be an integral part.
GEORGE Yes, inte-- h-how inte-- how integral?
MR._ROSS You'll be on the board of directors.
GEORGE Great, great. O-Oh, oh, oh, gosh. You know, it's just... my duties with the Yankees...
MRS._ROSS Don't worry, George. The foundation will revolve around your schedule. Evenings, weekends, whenever you have free time.
GEORGE I can't believe this is happening.
MR._ROSS Well, it wouldn't have without your friend Jerry's inspirational words. He said to us, "She's not really dead if her shadow is..." Uh, w-what was it, dear?
MRS._ROSS Something about a way, a-and a light, uh... ha. Who the hell knows?
MR._ROSS Well, what's important is that your relationship with Susan doesn't have to end.
MRS._ROSS So will you be sure to thank Jerry for us?
GEORGE The second I see him.
JERRY Hey.
GEORGE Hey. How's your day, good?
JERRY Actually, yeah. I'm meeting Mulva here in a few minutes.
GEORGE So uh... Wrath of Khan, huh?
JERRY Yeah. Was that a beauty or what?
GEORGE What was that line again? Something about finding your way in a shadow?
JERRY No, no, no, it's... "She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her."
GEORGE That's it. That's the line... ...that destroyed my life.
JERRY Problem?
GEORGE The Rosses have started up a foundation, Jerry, and I have to sit on the board of directors.
JERRY Hey, board of directors. Look at you!
GEORGE Yeah! Look at me! I was free and clear! I was living the dream! I was stripped to the waist, eating a block of cheese the size of a car battery!
JERRY Before we go any further, I'd just like to point out how disturbing it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor paradise.
GEORGE Don't you see? I'm back in.
JERRY All because of Wrath of Khan?
GEORGE Yes!
JERRY Well, it was the best of those movies.
GEORGE KHAN!
KHAN! WYCK
WYCK George.
WYCK George.
GEORGE Oh!
WYCK I'm Wyck Thayer, chairman of the Susan Ross Foundation.
GEORGE Wink.
WYCK Wyck.
GEORGE Wyck.
WYCK Now, as you know, the Rosses had considerable monies.
GEORGE Oh. I know they have some monies.
WYCK They had more than some monies. Many, many monies. And they planned to give a sizable portion of their estate to you and Susan after the wedding.
GEORGE So, if Susan and I had... I mean, if the envelopes hadn't, uh... then we--
WYCK Yes.
GEORGE And now?
WYCK Not. It's all been endowed to the foundation, even this townhouse.
GEORGE This townhouse?
WYCK This would have been your wedding gift.
GEORGE And now?
WYCK Not.
GEORGE Not.
WYCK Also endowed. George... I know how much Susan meant to you. It can't be easy.
GEORGE You know, it really can't.
MULVA So who broke it off?
JERRY Well, that's the thing. It was completely mutual.
MULVA Oh, come on. Everybody knows there's no such thing as a mutual breakup. Tell me the truth.
JERRY I am. It was the world's first.
MULVA You know, when I heard you got engaged, I thought maybe you had matured. But obviously there's no growth here.
JERRY Well, I can't argue with that, but the fact remains... I was completely... Mulva!
JERRY Hello?
SECRETARY Please hold for Elaine Benes.
JERRY Oh, I don't believe this.
ELAINE Jerry!
JERRY Hey!
ELAINE Hey. Guess who just finished laying out her first issue of the J. Peterman Catalog.
JERRY How's it look?
ELAINE It's a peach.
JERRY Huh?
ELAINE I say, it's a peach.
JERRY Elaine, let me ask you something. When I told you my breakup was mutual, did you believe me?
ELAINE No, no, no. It's weak. No one's gonna buy it, and you shouldn't be selling it.
JERRY I gotta do some research here.
ELAINE Hey, hey. Me. Talking. You know, between you and me, I always thought Kramer was a bit of a doofus, but he believed in me. You did not. So as I see it, he's not the doofus. You are the doofus.
JERRY Oh, I'm the doofus?
ELAINE Yeah. You, Jerry, are the doofus.
JERRY You know, it occurs to me that Kramer is at karate right now.
ELAINE Oh, well, maybe I'll just go down there and thank him in person.
JERRY Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
ELAINE Kramer!
KRAMER Oh, hey.
ELAINE What are you doing?
KRAMER Oh, well, I-I-I'm dominating.
ELAINE You never said you were fighting children.
KRAMER Well, it's not the size of the opponent, Elaine, it's, uh, the ferocity.
ELAINE This is what you used to build me up? This is where you got all that stupid katra stuff?
KRAMER No, no. That's from, uh, Star Trek III... The Search for Spock.
ELAINE Search... for Spock?!
KRAMER Yeah, I know Jerry will tell you that The Wrath of Khan is the better picture, but for me, I always...
ELAINE You doofus!
JERRY Okay, question 8. What if I told you my fiancee left me for another man? Does that make me more likable, less likable, as likable? Let's start over here this time.
WAITRESS_1 More.
WAITRESS_2 Less.
RUTHIE Same.
WILLIE Are we about through here?
KRAMER I thought you said your mom was meeting us in the alley.
JOEY She had a little change of plans.
KRAMER What's going on? Hey, Timmy, Clara. That was some kind of workout we had tonight, huh?
GIRL Now we finish it.
KRAMER Aah! Aah! Mama!
JERRY Dad, I wouldn't eat anything you caught in that pond out in front of the condo.
JERRY Uh, look, Elaine's here, I gotta get going. Oh, by the way, uh, I'm not getting married. Tell mom. Bye.
JERRY So... did you stop by the dojo?
ELAINE Yep.
JERRY How's your confidence level?
ELAINE Shot.
JERRY Self-esteem?
ELAINE Gone.
JERRY Doofus?
ELAINE Yo.
JERRY All right, so what? You put out the catalog. How bad could it be?
JERRY What is that?
ELAINE It's the Urban Sombrero. I put it on the cover.
JERRY Well, nobody sees the... cover.
KRAMER God!
JERRY What happened to you?
KRAMER Whew! I got whooped. You should have seen the rage in their little eyes. And those tiny little fists of fury. Oh. What is that?
JERRY It's the new cover of the J. Peterman Catalog. It is Elaine's choice. Let's congratulate her.
KRAMER Oh I see. Woof!
ELAINE You! This is all your fault! You told me I could run the company!
KRAMER Well, then I was way off!
ELAINE Well, I'll see ya...
JERRY Vaya con dios.
KRAMER Man, I gotta go lay down. You and George going out a little later?
JERRY No, he's still stuck at the foundation.
KRAMER You know, you oughta go down there and help him out. He's a widower.
JERRY Widower? Wait a second.
WYCK Okay, let's see. The beachhouse. 48 acres... ooh. Southampton. That should fetch a fair price.
GEORGE Would I have had access to that?
WYCK Of course, it would have been yours.
GEORGE And now?
GEORGE Not.
GEORGE Hello?
JERRY Hey, Georgie! I'm doing some research down at the coffee shop. Your story's the one.
GEORGE My story?
JERRY Yeah, your widower story's tested through the roof. When are you getting out of there?
GEORGE Uh, excuse me, Wyck. Uh, are we, uh, almost done here?
WYCK Oh, no, not even close.
GEORGE I can't go.
JERRY What do you mean you can't go? There's two really girls sitting at the counter eating grilled cheese. Cheese, George! Cheese!
WYCK Okay, next item. Susan's doll collection. Estimated value: $2.6 million. What do you say we go through this doll by doll?
JERRY Okay, thank you.
ELAINE So? What'd they say?
JERRY They're sending a detective to my apartment tomorrow.
ELAINE What the hell were you thinking leaving my clubs in that car?!
JERRY Well, I didn't count on my mechanic pulling a Mary-Beth Whitehead, did I?
ELAINE What kind of maniac is this guy?
JERRY He's a very special maniac.
ELAINE What am I supposed to tell Mr Peterman.
JERRY I don't know.
ELAINE Why couldn't you take better care of that car?!
PETERMAN Well, are they here?
ELAINE Mr Peterman, uh... There seems to be a bit of a snag.
PETERMAN Snag?
ELAINE It seems that a psychotic mechanic has absconded with my friend's car.
PETERMAN What does that have to do with my clubs?
ELAINE They happened to be in the back seat at the time.
DETECTIVE What was the suspect wearing at the time of the incident?
JERRY You know, like mechanic's pants, a shirt that said 'Tony'. Lemme ask you something, have you ever seen a case like this before?
DETECTIVE All the time. A mechanic forms an emotional attachment, thinks he's gonna lose the car, he panics, he does something rash. I'm gonna ask you some personal questions. I'm sorry if I touch a nerve, but I think it'll help with the case. Had you been taking good care of the car?
JERRY Had I been taking...?
DETECTIVE Well, did you leave the A/C on? Do you zip over speed bumps? Do you ride the clutch? Things like that.
JERRY W-well, what does it matter? It's my car, I can do whatever I want with it.
JERRY Not that I would think of doing such things.
DETECTIVE Alright Mr Seinfeld, we'll let you know if we find anything. I gotta be honest with you, these cases never end up well.
JERRY Well uh, whatever you can do. Thanks.
GEORGE Uh, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, about the project...
WILHELM That's what I came to talk to you about. Great job George. You really nailed it.
GEORGE I did?
WILHELM Oh yes, I read through it this morning. I couldn't have done it better myself, and I turned it right over to Mr Steinbrenner. Good work George.
JERRY I don't get it. He assigns it to you, you don't do it. Somehow it gets done, and now he's telling you what a great job you did.
GEORGE Maybe somebody did it and didn't take credit for it. Maybe it was already done and didn't need doing in the first place. I have no idea who did it, what they did, or how they did it so well. And you know what? Jimmy crack corn and I don't care.
WILHELM The gardener did a nice job planting the rose bushes, didn't he dear?
MRS_WILHELM You planted the rose bushes, dear.
WILHELM I did?
MRS_WILHELM Yesterday. You remember.
WILHELM That's right. What's for dinner?
MRS_WILHELM We just ate. Did you forget to take your medicine?
GEORGE The point is, however it got done, it's done. So, any luck with the car?
JERRY No. The police have no leads and I just found out today my insurance doesn't cover it.
GEORGE Why not?
JERRY They don't consider it stolen, if you wilfully give the guy the keys.
ELAINE Hey.
GEORGE Hey.
ELAINE Hey. What did the detective say?
JERRY They're looking.
GEORGE I gotta go.
JERRY Y'hello.
DETECTIVE Mr Seinfeld?
JERRY Yeah.
DETECTIVE It's Detective McMahon...
DETECTIVE ...I'm at the warehouse on Pier 38. Ah, I think you'd better get down here.
JERRY Yeah, okay. They may have found the car.
ELAINE Are the clubs in it? Ask him.
JERRY Are there golf clubs in the back?
DETECTIVE We really can't tell. You better bring your service records.
YOUNG_COP Watch where you step. There's quite a bit of... grease. Detective, Jerry Seinfeld is here.
DETECTIVE How d'you do. Thanks for coming down.
JERRY This is Elaine Benes.
ELAINE We used to date, but now we're just friends.
DETECTIVE I see.
JERRY Yeah.
DETECTIVE I'm sorry to make you go through this, but we need to make sure.
JERRY Well, what's going on? What is this thing?
DETECTIVE One of our patrolmen stumbled over this.
ELAINE Huuh!
JERRY Oh my God!
DETECTIVE The block is nearly split apart. We found the overhead cams thirty feet away. We can only hope the body sold for scrap.
ELAINE Oh, my God.
DETECTIVE And we know it's a Saab. The angle on the Vee-6 is definitely ninety-two. The model is hard to determine because the drive train is all burnt out.
JERRY What is that smell?
DETECTIVE Look at the clutch.
ELAINE Uuh.
YOUNG_COP Excuse me.
DETECTIVE Whoever did this didn't just dismantle it. I mean, they took their time, they had fun. They were very systematic. They went out of their way to gouge the sides of every piston, and the turbo was separated from the housing and shoved right up the exhaust pipe.
ELAINE Uhh
JERRY Wait a second. Turbo? I didn't have a turbo.
DETECTIVE Your car's not a turbo?
JERRY No, it's a nine-hundred S. It's a turbo, Elaine, a turbo!
ELAINE It's a tu-hur-bo.
WOMAN Excuse me, did you say turbo? Saab turbo nine-thousand? Is it... midnight blue?
DETECTIVE Yes ma'am. KRAMER/
NEWMAN Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottles and cans. At ten cents a bottle and ten cents a can, we're pulling in five hundred dollars a man. Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottles and cans. We fill up with gas, we count up our cash!!...
JERRY Hello.
TONY Hey Jerry, it's Tony.
JERRY Tony, where are you?
TONY Aw look, I just want you to know that the car is fine. I got her all fixed up. We're in a nice area, no potholes, no traffic. So there's nothing to worry about. Okay? In fact, here, somebody wants to talk to you.
JERRY Tony, y-you better bring that car back!
TONY Nobody's giving anything back! You tried to take it from me, I don't forget that.
JERRY Tony, it is my car, and I want it back!
TONY Oh, your car. You want your car back!
JERRY Tony.
TONY Listen, that registration may have your name on it, Jerry. But this engine's running on my sweat and my blood.
JERRY Where do I find these guys?
NEWMAN How much gas we got?
KRAMER Three quarters of a tank.
KRAMER That's better than we estimated.
NEWMAN That is seven dollars and twenty-two cents better.
NEWMAN Maybe we could uh, stop for a snack.
KRAMER Ah, no, that's not in the budget.
NEWMAN Yeah well, the budget changed, you know. I mean, it might be a good investment.
KRAMER That's not a good investment, that's a loss.
KRAMER Hey, d'you see that car? Looks like Jerry's. I'm gonna check out that license plate.
KRAMER Yeah, those are New York plates.
NEWMAN Is that Jerry's number?
KRAMER I don't know, but that's New York and we're in Ohio. Those are pretty good odds.
NEWMAN What're you doing?
KRAMER I'm calling Jerry.
NEWMAN On what?
KRAMER Brought my phone.
JERRY Y'hello.
KRAMER Yeah, hey Jerry, what's your licence plate number?
JERRY Why, what's up?
KRAMER Yeah, well I think I spotted your car.
JERRY Oh my god, you're kidding. Hang on a second. It's JVN 728.
KRAMER Hey, that's it! That's it. Hey, uh look, we got him. We're driving right behind him in a truck.
JERRY Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, he said he brought it to the country.
KRAMER Well we're in the country and we're right on his tail.
JERRY Good work Kramer, this is incredible.
KRAMER Yeah, don't worry Jerry. We're right on this guy like stink on a monkey! I'll check back with you.
ELAINE Elaine Benes.
JERRY Yeah, it's me. Kramer found the car!
ELAINE Oh my god, where is it?
JERRY It's somewhere in the country, they're following 'em.
ELAINE Are the clubs there?
JERRY I don't know. They're tailing him. I'm waiting for them to call me back.
ELAINE Alright, I'm heading over right now.
ELAINE What's the status?
JERRY Last check-in, they were still on him.
ELAINE Well, have they called the police yet?
JERRY No, they won't call the police.
ELAINE What? Why not?
JERRY They're afraid they'll get in trouble for misusing a mail truck. Kramer doesn't want a record.
ELAINE Kramer has a record.
JERRY Not a Federal record.
ELAINE_AND_JERRY Kramer?
JERRY What's going on?
KRAMER Yeah, nothing. We're still following him.
KRAMER Wait a second, he's getting off. Yeah, he's gonna be going south on the one-thirty-five.
ELAINE Keep following him.
KRAMER Alright, alright, I'll follow him.
NEWMAN Hey, we can't follow him, we're going north to Michigan.
KRAMER Yeah, hey listen, I can't. It's gonna be taking us out of our way.
ELAINE I need those clubs.
JERRY Kramer, I want my car.
KRAMER Well, I don't know what to do.
NEWMAN Hey, we got ten thousand deposit bottles here. I mean, this guy could be going to Arkansas.
JERRY Keep following him Kramer. don't let me down.
NEWMAN Hey, don't listen to him. I mean, we can't afford a detour. Our budget won't hold it.
KRAMER Well, I don't know what to do man!
NEWMAN Kramer! Stay left. Left, left, left.
ELAINE_AND_JERRY Right. Go right! South!
KRAMER Alright! Alright. I'm getting off! I'm gonna go on the ramp.
NEWMAN I hope you realise what you've done. You've destroyed our whole venture.
KRAMER This ramp is steep.
NEWMAN All my work, my planning, my genius. All for nought.
KRAMER Alright, look, we're pulling too much weight. He's getting away from us here. Take the wheel.
NEWMAN What're you doing?
KRAMER I'm gonna get something.
NEWMAN Are you crazy?
KRAMER Keep your foot on the gas.
NEWMAN Hey! You're not dumping those bottles back there, are you?
NEWMAN Hey Kramer, those have wholesale value! We could cut our losses.
KRAMER Look out below!!
STEINBRENNER With this magnifying glass, I feel like a scientist.
GEORGE You wanted to see me, sir?
STEINBRENNER Ah, come in George, come in.
STEINBRENNER Uh, Wilhelm gave me this project you worked on.
GEORGE Yes sir.
STEINBRENNER Let me ask you something, George. You having any personal problems at home? Girl trouble, love trouble of any kind?
GEORGE No sir.
STEINBRENNER What about drugs? You doing some of that crack cocaine? You on the pipe?
GEORGE No sir.
STEINBRENNER Are you seeing a psychiatrist? Bcause I got a flash for you young man, you're non compos mentis! You got some bats in the belfry!
GEORGE What're.. What're you talking about?
STEINBRENNER George, I've read this report. It's very troubling, very troubling indeed. It's a sick mind at work here.
STEINBRENNER Okay, come on boys, come on in here. George, this is Herb and Dan.
STEINBRENNER They're gonna take you away to a nice place where you can get some help. They're very friendly people there. My brother-in-law was there for a couple of weeks. The man was obsessed with lactating women. They completely cured him, although he still eats a lot of cheese.
GEORGE Ah, see, Mister.. I didn't write that report. That, that's not mine.
STEINBRENNER Of course you didn't George. Of course you didn't write it.
GEORGE I didn't do it! It..It just got done. I don't know how it got done, but it did.
STEINBRENNER Of course. Of course it got done. Things get done all the time, I understand. Don't worry, your job'll be waiting for you when you get back. Get better George. Get better!
KRAMER Damn. I don't understand this. I've ditched every bottle and can, and we still can't gain. It's like we're...
KRAMER ...sluggish.
NEWMAN I went through all those bottles and all those cans, for what? What a waste. And I'm really gonna catch hell for those missing mailbags.
KRAMER Heyy, wasn't that a pie stand back there?
NEWMAN A pie stand? Where?
KRAMER Oh yeah. Home-made pies, two hundred yards back.
NEWMAN Aww, c'mon, pull over, pull over will ya.
NEWMAN Where? I..I..I don't see it.
KRAMER Well open the door, you get a better look.
NEWMAN I don't see any pie...
NEWMAN ...Aargh!
NEWMAN Kramer!!
KRAMER I'm sorry Newman, you were holding us back.
NEWMAN Kramer!!
KRAMER Jerry! We've lost the fat man, and we're running lean. We're back on track, buddy!
NEWMAN Federal employee. Federal employee.
FARMER Hello stranger.
NEWMAN Ah, look, I..I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm a US postal worker and my mail truck was just ambushed by a band of backwoods mail-hating survivalists.
FARMER Calm down, now. Calm down. Don't worry, we'll take care of you. This farm ain't much, but uh, you're welcome to what we have. Hot bath, hearty meal, clean bed.
NEWMAN Oh, thank you, sir.
FARMER Just have one rule. Keep your hands off my daughter.
KRAMER Jerry, we got 'im. I'm riding his tail. There's no escape. He's running scared, buddy.
JERRY How's the gas situation?
KRAMER I got enough to get to Memphis. He's reaching in back. He's grabbing at something.
KRAMER He's pulling out a gun! He's got a gun, Jerry!!
JERRY Duck, Kramer! Duck!
KRAMER It's a golf club! It's no gun. He threw a golf club at me!
ELAINE Those are JFK's golf clubs!
KRAMER Hey, I'm under fire here. I'm under heavy fire here, boy. Jeez! That was a five-iron!
ELAINE Stop the truck, Kramer. Pick up the clubs!
JERRY No, don't stop, Kramer. Keep going, don't let him get away.
KRAMER Wait a minute, I think he's done. Oh no, he's taking out the woods!
KRAMER You'll have to do a lot better than that!
JERRY What's happening!
KRAMER This truck is dying. We're losing him.
KRAMER I think we lost him.
JERRY Dammit!
ELAINE Can you stop and pick up those clubs Kramer?
KRAMER Yeah, yeah, I'll get 'em.
FARMER Enjoy that mutton?
NEWMAN It's delicious mutton. This is uh, this is outta sight. I would, I would love to get the recipe. It's very good.
FARMER That cider too strong for you?
NEWMAN No, no. I love strong cider. I'm a big, strong, cider guy.
FARMER Gonna be milking Holsteins in the morning, if you'd like to lend a hand.
NEWMAN You know, I don't really know that much about uh.. I don't have any.. I don't.. I don't think I know much about that.
FARMER Ahh, Susie here'll teach you.
FARMER Just gotta pull on the teat a little.
SUSIE Nice having a big, strong, man around.
NEWMAN You know, those mail bags, they get mighty heavy. I uh, I Nautilus, of course.
NEWMAN Can I have some gravy?
GEORGE Steinbrenner had me committed! I'm in the nuthouse!
DEENA I'll be back same time next week, Pop.
GEORGE They took my belt, Jerry. I got nothing to hold my pants up. Well, you gotta come over here now! Just tell 'em what we talked about, how I, how I, I didn't do the project.
DEENA George?
DEENA I see you're finally getting some help.
GEORGE Aw, hoh, oh Deena, thank God. Thank God you're here. Listen, you gotta help me. You gotta tell these people that I'm okay. You know that I don't belong in here.
DEENA George, this is the best thing for you.
GEORGE Yea... What? No, no!
GEORGE Deena! Deena, wait a... Deena, help!
POP Is that little Georgie C? How's the folks? You still got that nice little car?
NEWMAN Aaah!! Aaah!
KRAMER What you doing?!
NEWMAN Kramer, help me! Help me!
KRAMER Jeez!
FARMER I told you to keep away from my daughter!
SUSIE No daddy, you'll hurt him! I love him! Goodbye Norman, goodbye.
PETERMAN Elaine! You found the clubs. That's wonderful news. Where are they?
ELAINE Yep. Lemme get 'em for you, Mr Peterman.
PETERMAN Oh, I'll be inaugrating them this weekend, with none other than Ethel Kennedy. A woman whose triumph in the face of tragedy is exceeded only by her proclivity to procreate.
ELAINE The uh, the letter of, authenticity's in the side pocket there.
PETERMAN Elaine. I never knew Kennedy had such a temper.
ELAINE Oh. Oh yeah. The only thing worse was his slice.
PETERMAN See you on Monday. Peterman picks up the bag and heads for the door.
ELAINE Have a good game.
JERRY I always feel bad for the silver medal winner in the Olympics. How do you live with that the rest of your life? People are gonna keep asking - How much did you lose by? I don't even know...! It was like... now.now...now.now..now..was like, like... now..now..now...! It was it...! Eh, it was it and I lost. I trained, I worked out, I exercised, I did everything, I was doing push-ups, sit-ups, I never did anything but exercise and work out for 20 years, I flew half way around the world and aaaaaaaaaah!... And that was...it was a photo-finish! Silver......gold. If I had a pimple, I would've won.
JERRY I can't believe you write for this J. Peterman catalog.
JERRY Get this one - "I packed my rod and reel. 30 hours later, lost in the fiord, a welcoming smile. Thank god she spotted the epaulettes on my Norwegian ice-fishing vest".
GEORGE This catalog is all about how to score in a foreign country.
ELAINE Yeah. What do you do all day?
GEORGE Not that much.
ELAINE uh-uh.
JERRY I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more work.
GEORGE Yeah, when the season starts. Right now, I sit around pretending that I'm busy.
JERRY How do you pull that off?
GEORGE I always look annoyed. Yeah, when you look annoyed all the time, people think that you're busy. Think about it... .
ELAINE Yeah, you do! He looks very busy!
JERRY Yeah, he looks busy! Yeah!
GEORGE I know what I'm doin'. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one of those little stress dolls. All right. Back to work.
JERRY So did you come up with a little stupid story for the Himalayan walking shoe yet?
ELAINE No. I'm completely blocked! In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh, I can't! I got that marathon runner coming in tonight.
JERRY What marathon runner?
ELAINE You know, this guy Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul... I met him when I was working at Pendant, editing a book on running...
JERRY Oh, wait! Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul! Isn't he the guy who overslept at the Olympics 4 years ago and missed the marathon?!
ELAINE Yeah, that's him.
JERRY He's from uh...Trinidad and Tobago, right?
ELAINE Yeah, he's Trinidadian and...Tobagan.
JERRY How do you oversleep at the Olympics...?
ELAINE Ah, I know. I know...!
JERRY I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! You'd think you'd have, like, 6 alarm clocks, payin'-off little kids in the village to come banging on your door...
ELAINE Yeah, well, he was pretty devastated. This is his first race in 3 years.
JERRY Ah...that's a big responsability on your hands.
ELAINE What responsibility? I don't have any responsibility.
JERRY You gotta wake him up!
ELAINE Eh...he'll get up...
ELAINE Hi, Judy.
JUDY Hi, Elaine. How are you?
ELAINE Fine.
JERRY I've seen her in your building.
ELAINE Yeah.
JERRY I didn't know she was married.
ELAINE She's not... and the guy just took off. Don't say anything to anybody.
JERRY Whom I gonna tell?
ELAINE I know, it's just something you have to say...
WILHELM George, we just got the final budget numbers. We went over budget on some of the items, but I don't think there's gonna be a problem. I'll let you get back to work, George.
JERRY He overslept and missed the whole race. Isn't that amazing?
GEORGE I'll tell you what happened. I bet he got the am pm mixed-up.
JERRY My money's on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an extra 5 and it never came back on. Imagine your whole life riding on an alarm clock.
KRAMER Alarm clocks? I never use 'em. Don't trust 'em.
JERRY What do you do?
KRAMER I have a uh...mental alarm. I set my head for... quarter to seven and... ...I get up!
JERRY Always works?
KRAMER It never fails. See, it's based on your body clock. See, your body has an internal mechanism. It knows what time it is.
GEORGE uh-uh. What's with the bucket?
KRAMER Lomez, he sold me his hot tub.
JERRY Hot tub?
KRAMER Yeah yeah, it's in my living room. I just gotta fill it.
GEORGE You put a hot tub... in your living room?
KRAMER Oh, it's a beauty! It's got these high-volume aqua-sage jets oscillating and pulsating, soothing your every aching muscle. The water's gonna get over 120 degrees!
GEORGE Is that tolerable?
KRAMER Oh...it's tolerable...!
JERRY Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded you?
KRAMER Oh, I think it's a little cooler than that...
GEORGE He uh...doesn't have any running water?
JERRY I don't ask those kind of questions anymore.
ELAINE Jerry. Jerry, this is Jean-Paul.
JERRY Ah, hi Jean-Paul. Nice to meet you.
JEAN_PAUL Nice to meet you.
JERRY Sorry about the Olympics.
JEAN_PAUL Me too.
ELAINE Listen, listen I'm gonna go call work to see if I can get my deadline extended. I can't...come up with anything for this thing.
JERRY Ah...catalog writer's block?
ELAINE Yeah, that's funny.
JERRY So what happened? The snooze alarm, wasn't it?
JEAN_PAUL Man, it wasn't the snooze. Most people think it was the snooze, but no, no snooze.
JERRY am pm.
JEAN_PAUL Man, it wasn't the am pm. It was the volume.
JERRY Ah...the volume.
JEAN_PAUL Yes, the volume. There was a separate knob for the radio alarm.
JERRY Ah, separate knob.
JEAN_PAUL Yes, separate knob. Why separate knob?! Why separate knob?!
JERRY Some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder than the radio.
JEAN_PAUL Oh, please, man, please!
JERRY Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have anything to say about it.
JERRY Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?
ELAINE Jerry...
JERRY It's a simple question...
ELAINE I've got an alarm, ok?
JERRY That old one? Didn't I once miss a flight to Cleveland because of that alarm clock?
JEAN_PAUL Flight to Cleveland?
ELAINE It works.
JERRY Elaine...
ELAINE It... works!
GEORGE Eh...come oooon...
WILHELM George...I think you may be taking work a little too seriously.
GEORGE Well...I've got a lot to do!
WILHELM George, I'll tell you what I'd like you to do. I, I'd like you to drop everything.
WILHELM I have this... fun little assignment I think you'll enjoy. There's some reps in from the Houston Astros for talks on that interleague play... and I want you to show them a good time.
ELAINE Hey. Sorry I'm late.
JERRY You're 40 minutes late. What happened?
ELAINE I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?
JERRY No.
ELAINE What? What is the problem?
JERRY Well, you said you were gonna be here at a certain time, and you weren't.
ELAINE uh-uh. uh-uh. And this all means uh...what?
JERRY Well, means that a man has come from very far away to compete in a very difficult race, he's put his faith in you, and frankly, I'm a little concerned!
ELAINE Oh are you?!
JERRY Yes I am.
ELAINE Hey, I'm not running in the marathon! He is!
JERRY Yeah, I know that!
ELAINE Yeah, I got enough to think about just tryin' to come up with some load o'crap for that Himalayan walking shoe! I mean, I've given him a place to stay, I'll set an alarm, but I'm not gonna turn my life completely upside down for this guy!
JERRY I'm not talking about upside down. I'm talking about waking him up!
ELAINE Hey, Jean-Paul.
JERRY Hey, Jean-Paul. How was your soak? Was a good soak?
JEAN_PAUL Ah, man, very good soak. The soak o'the year!
KRAMER What's burning?
ELAINE Oh! My muffin! Oh, shoot!
JERRY What happened?
ELAINE Oh I don't know. I set this thing for 20 seconds.
KRAMER This was set for 2 minutes. See?
ELAINE Don't say anything! Don't..say..anything!
JEAN_PAUL You miss-set the timer...
ELAINE Jean-Paul, it's not my microwave, ok? Ok? All right, listen, let's just go. Come on, Jean-Paul, let's go. Let's go.
JEAN_PAUL Ok.
ELAINE All right. We'll see you at the race, ok?
JERRY Yeah. I hope so ?!
ELAINE Oh that's cute!
JERRY Kramer, I'm tellin' you, Elaine doesn't know whatta hell she's doin'! I gotta take over this whole operation!
KRAMER Jerry, look how tense you are... You need to take a soak.
JERRY I'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria frat you got goin' there.
KRAMER Come on, I'm tellin' you, it's great. I opened up all the windows... the air is cold, the tub is boiling hot... It's like Sweden, man. Sweeeeden!
KRAMER ...oooohhh yeeaaah... aaahhh...
CLAYTON ...'till this bastard over here says: "let's call the sons o'bitches and go visit 'em on New York!"
GEORGE Well, we're certainly glad that you could make it.
GARDNER I like your organization, George. We've been talkin' to a really friendly son of a bitch in the front office. Wilhelm, I think his name.
GEORGE Oh yes, Mr.Wilhelm, yeah...
GARDNER He told us that George Costanza was gonna be takin' us bastards out on the town. "that son of a bitch doesn't know what he's got in store for him!".
ZEKE Finish your drink?
GEORGE Oh yeah, al-almost. Almost.
ZEKE Let's get that bastard bring us another round!
CLAYTON You a big drinker, George?
GEORGE Well...maybe not as much as this bastard... I can hold my own!
JERRY Jean-Paul, I asked you down here this morning because I'm concerned. Concerned that tomorrow is perhaps the biggest race of your entire career. And the person with whom you have chosen to stay... is uh...
JEAN_PAUL What are you saying?
JERRY I'm saying "get the hell outta there"! Let me put you in a hotel. You'll be comfortable, you'll be near the starting line, and most importantly... you'll have a wake-up call, Jean-Paul! A wake-up call!
JEAN_PAUL Wake-up call...
JERRY These people never fail. They sit in a room with a big clock all night long, just waitin' to make that call!
JEAN_PAUL No, I will stay with Elaine. It would be rude.
GEORGE Hey, you bastards.
JERRY Hey, how was the meeting?
GEORGE I really like those sons of bitches.
JERRY Sons of bitches?
GEORGE Yeah! That's how they talk. You know, everyone's either a bastard or a son of a bitch. Yeah, it's like uh..."boy, that son of a bitch Box can really hit, uh?!"
JEAN_PAUL Really?!
GEORGE Yeah, yeah. That's how they talk in the major league.
KRAMER Heeeeey...
JERRY How many sweaters you got on?
KRAMER Oh...four. Yeah, could I have a cup o'tea? Boiling hot.
GEORGE What's goin'on?
KRAMER I fell asleep in the hot tub and the heat pump broke. Water went down to 58 degrees. I can't get my core temperature back up!
JERRY Your core temperature?
KRAMER Here, feel my hand. Yeah, feel.
JEAN_PAUL Phew... this son of a bitch is ice-cold.
GEORGE Hello?
CLAYTON uh...is that you, George?
GEORGE Yeah, it's me. Is this Clayton?
CLAYTON Well listen, you son of a bitch! You know where we are? 30 000 feet above your head, you bastard!
GEORGE What are they doin' lettin' you bastards on an airplane? Don't they know that's against FAA regulation?
CLAYTON Hey, hush up, now! I can't hear him!
GEORGE Listen. I want you guys to send along those agreements the minute you land. Our boys can't wait to kick your butts!
ZEKE When's that bastard comin' to Houston?
CLAYTON Hey, Zeke wants to know when you Yankee bastards are comin' to Houston!
GEORGE You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston. Not as long as you bastards are running things.
CLAYTON Hey, uh, speak up, George, I can't hear ya!
GEORGE You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston! Not as long as you bastards are running things!
WILHELM George! George, get a hold of yourself!
GEORGE Mr.Wilhelm...
WILHELM What's the matter with you?!
GEORGE Well I-I...
ELAINE It was a cold winter's night in Timbuktu... Oh! This stinks! Oh, come on... come on...!...God!
JEAN_PAUL Hello.
JUDY Hello.
JEAN_PAUL I'm a friend of Elaine's.
JUDY Oh, hi.
JEAN_PAUL oooooh...look at the cute little bastard... you are mama's little bastard, aren't you?
MANAGER Whatta hell are you doin' harassing my tenants?
JEAN_PAUL Oh come on, you son of a bitch. I'm just trying to be friendly.
MANAGER All right, that's it! Let's go!
JEAN_PAUL What...but I got a race tomorrow!
GEORGE Whoa...it's like a furnace in here!
JERRY Oh whatta hell is goin'on?!
KRAMER Yeah, I turned up the heat.
JERRY Turn up the heat in your apartment!
KRAMER I'm freezin'! I just need to get my hot tub running. I'm waiting for my new heat pump.
GEORGE Well what's in this giant box out in the hall?
KRAMER Uh? Oh that must be it.
GEORGE It's huge!
KRAMER Yeah, yeah, I got the biggest one they had. It's industrial strength. 16000 BTUs.
JERRY Hello?...yeah, I can be there in 10 minutes...you can count on me!
GEORGE What?
JERRY I got the call...!
GEORGE Jean-Paul?
JERRY Jean-Paul!
JERRY Pretty lucky to find this hotel, Jean-Paul.
JEAN_PAUL Man, I just want to get some sleep.
JERRY All right. Let's check out the clock. Notch good... 6:50... volume check. What kinda music you wanna wake up to? Top 40, classical...
JEAN_PAUL Man, whatever!
JERRY How about adult contemporary?
JEAN_PAUL Fine, adult contemporary. Just pick one!
JERRY All right...we're going with adult contempo... now... the failsafe. The wake-up guy...
JEAN_PAUL Yes, yes, the wake-up guy.
MAN Front desk...?
JERRY Yeah, this is room 419, I'd like a wake-up call for 6:50 AM tomorrow morning.
MAN Yes sir.
JERRY That's room 419. 6:50 AM. Four...one...niner...
MAN Yes, I got it sir. You only had to say it once.
JERRY I know, but it's a very important wake-up call... and I don't wanna take any chances.
MAN Every wake-up call I make is important. You're no more important than any of our guests.
JERRY Well, I just...don't wanna get into a whole thing with you here...
MAN Are you through?
JERRY ...Yeah I am, but I just...
JERRY humm...
JEAN_PAUL What is it...?
JERRY I think I offended the wake-up guy...!
JEAN_PAUL No, no.
JERRY No, no, I did. I think he's got it in for me!
JEAN_PAUL Man, he doesn't got "in" for you.
JERRY What if he doesn't call now out of spite?
JEAN_PAUL It is his job!
JERRY Not comfortable...
JEAN_PAUL For God's sake...!
ELAINE Jean-Paul? Hey Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul?! Oh man... Oh...machine.
JERRY'S_MACHINE I'm not here, leave a message.
ELAINE Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul's missing! He's alone in the city! Call me back.
ELAINE Judy, hi, listen...
JUDY You have got some nerve, Elaine! I told you about that baby in confidence!
ELAINE Oh I didn't tell anyone.
JUDY Well your friend certainly seemed to know all about it.
ELAINE ... Jerry!
JERRY Feel much better here at my home base, Jean-Paul. It's a controlled environment.
JEAN_PAUL It's a marathon, you know. 26 miles! I need to get some sleep!
JERRY Hey, believe me, if I'd been with you there in Barcelona...you'd be polishing that medal right now.
JEAN_PAUL Left a comfortable hotel bedroom for this!
JERRY That wake-up guy was trouble! All right, I'll be right back.
JERRY Man that thing is noisy!
KRAMER Yeah yeah, we're cracking along pretty good! We're almost up to 80 degrees!
JERRY Yeah, listen, do me a favor. Set your mental alarm for 6:30 and gimme a call.
KRAMER Yeah, ok. Wait. Done!
JERRY He's put his faith in you. He's put his faith in you.
JEAN_PAUL I trust Elaine, she is my friend. I trust Elaine, she is my friend.
JERRY Frankly, I'm a little concerned.
ELAINE Ohhh, I'm exhausted. I've been on this street a thousand times! It's never looked so strange! The faces...so cold! In the distance, a child is crying. Fatherless...a bastard child, perhaps. My back aches...my heart aches...but my feet ...my feet are resilient! Thank God I took off my heels, and put on my... Himalayan walking shoes! Yes!
JERRY 4:02? Aaa-aaahhh! Eight forty seven Jean-Paul! Wake up! Wake uuuuup! Jean-Paul! The electricity went out! Wake up! Wake up! We gotta go! It's 8:47!
JEAN_PAUL 8:47!?
JERRY Come on, just put your clothes on! You'll get dressed in the car!
JEAN_PAUL Idiot! I trusted you!
JERRY Kramer, what happened to the building?! The electricity went out!
KRAMER Yeah, the heat pump blew all the fuses!
JERRY What happened to your mental alarm?!
KRAMER I guess I hit the snooze...
JERRY Make way! I've got-I've got a runner here! Get outta the way! Make way! Make way! Make way, it's a contender!
GUARD Hey, hold it!
JEAN_PAUL I'm late, man, I'm in the race!
GUARD Go ahead.
JEAN_PAUL Thank you Jerry, you're a wonderful driver. Fantastic route, man!
JERRY All right, go, it's a race! Come on!
GEORGE You wanted to see me, Mr.Steinbrenner?
STEINBRENNER Yes, George, come in, come in. George, word up's you've been cracking under the pressure. Can't cope, can't stand the heat. Spit the bit.
GEORGE Oh no, Mr.Steinbrenner, I can explain...
STEINBRENNER Oh we all get a little cuckoo sometimes George, I used to be like you. Rating personnel 'till they cried, calling managers on the field during a game, threatening to move the team to New Jersey, just to upset people. Then I found a way to relax. .
JERRY I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never even went near your building!
ELAINE Then how did she find out, Jerry?!
JERRY Maybe you should check with the rabbi.
KRAMER You want some hot tea?
ELAINE Oh no, thank you.
KRAMER Oh. There's some runners. Here they come!
ELAINE There's Jean-Paul! He's up front! He's leading! Go Jean-Paul!
KRAMER Oh yeah! Yeah! Come on!
JERRY Come on, let's go Jean-Paul!
ELAINE Go Jean-Paaaaaul!
STEINBRENNER How're you enjoying it, George? Melts that tension away, doesn't it? You gotta get that jet on the good spot. Oh. Oh. Uh. Uh. Yes, that feels good. Yes, that's real good. Oh yeah, that's where I keep all my tension. Right down to that chicken bone. Sometimes I get my wife to just stuck her thumb right in there like a screwdriver. Ya know, the Phillips head, not the flat one. Oh God, those flat ones frustrate me. You got it in, but it slips out. You put it in again, slips out again. You a single man, George?
GEORGE Well, I-I just recently uh...
STEINBRENNER I'll tell you, if you wanna get something wild goin'on in your life, you get a girl and bring her to one o'these things. Just like 4 shots a wild turkey. She'll think you're Hopalong Cassidy. A show, about that Mickey Mantle, wasn't it? You know we used to talk. I don't think he liked me very much, you know.
AUDREY Hum! That was really good!
JERRY Yeah. Are you full?
AUDREY Oh no, I've had just enough.
JERRY Here we go... apple pie! Best apple pie in the city. Delicious. I'm not waiting for you. Take some.
AUDREY No thanks.
JERRY You're not gonna have any?
AUDREY No
JERRY Do you not like apple pie?
AUDREY No, it's not that.
JERRY Well, at least taste it.
AUDREY No
JERRY You won't even taste it?
AUDREY No.
JERRY Come on, try it! A little taste! Come on!
GEORGE Did she say why?
JERRY No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head like this
GEORGE Maybe she's diabetic.
JERRY No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse.
GEORGE Maybe you said something that offended her.
JERRY The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those moving walkways all over the city.
GEORGE Like at the airport?
JERRY Yeah.
GEORGE That's a great idea!!!
JERRY Tell me about it!
GEORGE We could be zipping all over the place.
JERRY They could at least try it.
GEORGE They never try anything.
JERRY What's the harm?
GEORGE No harm!
JERRY I'm sorry. There's no reason for her not to taste that pie.
ELAINE Who wouldn't taste a pie?
JERRY Audrey.
ELAINE Dump her.
JERRY Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie???
ELAINE I once broke up with someone for not offering me pie.
JERRY You did?
ELAINE He could be eating a Hero, he wouldn't offer me anything. It's a sickness.
GEORGE Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I just gonna be wishing there were walkways. What are you doing?
ELAINE I got a pebble.
JERRY Boy, I never heard of that happening to a woman?
ELAINE What the hell does that mean?
KRAMER Hey! Elaine. Go Like this.
ELAINE What? Why?
KRAMER Do it. Do it. This.
ELAINE Like... Like this?
KRAMER Oh yeah! It's you!
ELAINE What's me?
KRAMER There's a clothing store downtown. They got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine.
ELAINE Get out!
KRAMER It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together, and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite.
GEORGE Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequin?
KRAMER Rinitze. Oh yeah...
JERRY Uh... may I help you?
KRAMER It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one my couch cushion didn't have any fabric on it.
GEORGE Wait a minute, Rinitze? Don't they have somme really cool suits in there?
KRAMER Real Boss!
ELAINE I'm going down there.
GEORGE I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking me out to lunch on Friday.
ELAINE Let's go.
GEORGE All right. All right.
KRAMER Are you gonna need this?
JERRY Keep it.
ELAINE It looks exactly like me.
GEORGE It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. Don't fall asleep Elaine.
ELAINE What's going on here? How do you think this happened?
GEORGE Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh?
ELAINE You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible?
SALESWOMAN You are perfect for that suit.
GEORGE You think so?
ELAINE Excuse me. Where did this come from?
SALESWOMAN I don't know.
GEORGE You really think this looks O.K. on me?
SALESWOMAN Fabulous. Perfect fit. And it's the last one we have.
ELAINE I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from?
SALESWOMAN I told you, I don't know.
ELAINE Well, is there somebody around here I could talk to who would know?
SALESWOMAN Why?
ELAINE Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me.
ELAINE Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is me at him about you.
SALESWOMAN I think maybe you're flattering yourself. That mannquein is wearing a 1200$ Gaultier dress.
ELAINE What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous dress? Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. I'll meet you outside.
SALESWOMAN What is her problem?
GEORGE Pfft! What can you do? Is this the price tag?
SALESWOMAN Yes.
GEORGE Yes, hello. Party's over.
SALESWOMAN I'll tell you a little secret. We're having an unadvertised sale starting Friday, that suit will be half-price.
GEORGE So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me?
SALESWOMAN Oh, I'm afraid I could't do that. It wouldn't be fair to the other customers.
GEORGE Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair.
ELAINE So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em up.
KRAMER How did they get your face?
ELAINE I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. Jerry? Je... Hello?
JERRY Uh... Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie.
WOMAN_1 That's right.
JERRY And you waved it away.
WOMAN_2 Right.
JERRY Did you give her a reason?
WOMAN_2 Yes, I was full.
JERRY You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your head.
WOMAN_2 No, I'm not a psycho.
JERRY Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank you very much. Allow me to leave the tip. Well, I think we proven who the psycho is.
ELAINE We certainly have.
KRAMER Hey, Elaine scratch my back.
ELAINE No way!
KRAMER Come on, one lap around.
ELAINE No.
KRAMER It will be a funky adventure.
ELAINE Kramer, forget it.
KRAMER Jerry, how about you?
JERRY I think you know my policy.
KRAMER I'm going home to spatula.
ELAINE I thought George was meeting us here?
JERRY No he's going downtown to guard the suit.
ELAINE He's guarding a suit?
OLIVE Do you need some help with that itch?
KRAMER Madam, I pray you're not toying with me. Whoa.
OLIVE Turn around.
KRAMER Oh, all right.
SALESWOMAN It fits you perfectly.
BOB You think so?
GEORGE What's this? Can't I leave this place for a second? Can I help you?
BOB I'm buying the suit.
GEORGE No, no, no, this suit is not for sale.
BOB Excuse me, do you work here?
GEORGE No.
BOB Then what the hell business is it of yours?
GEORGE Look, I'm doing you a favor. They're having an unadvertised sale. This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday.
BOB Really? This Monday?
GEORGE Yes. Now take off those pants.
SALESWOMAN Actually, the unadvertised sale starts on Friday.
BOB Friday? Thanks.
GEORGE You know honey for an unadvertised sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it.
JERRY I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts here?
AUDREY Everything is delicious.
JERRY You've tasted them?
AUDREY Um-hmm, I think almost all of them.
JERRY Oh I see they have apple pie.
AUDREY Mmm-hmm.
JERRY You've had the apple pie?
AUDREY Many times.
JERRY Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind.
AUDREY Can we drop this?
JERRY Why can't I know?
AUDREY Ah! Poppie.
POPPIE Sweetheart, hello.
AUDREY Poppie, this is Jerry.
POPPIE Welcome
JERRY Hello Poppie.
POPPIE Don't fill up on the bread. I'm making you a very special dinner. Very special.
JERRY The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know.
POPPIE Ah, Jerry! Tonight you in for a real treat. I'm personnaly going to prepare the dinner for you and my Audrey.
AUDREY Jerry are you ok?
JERRY Huh?
AUDREY Is anything wrong?
JERRY No, Nothing.
AUDREY You look like you've seen a ghost.
OLIVE I'll see you tomorrow.
KRAMER Hey. These are for you Olive.
OLIVE Thank you.
KRAMER Ohh!
POPPIE Here it is.
AUDREY Wait till you taste this. Poppie, this is perfect.
POPPIE Well?
AUDREY Jerry have some.
AUDREY You're not gonna taste it?
AUDREY Jerry.
JERRY So she tought I did it to get back at her
GEORGE Why didn't you just tell her?
JERRY I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was kneading that dough, it was a wild scene.
GEORGE How could he not have washed?
JERRY Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit. Turn the water on, do something.
GEORGE Yeah, just like I do.
JERRY You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's a cry for help, he wants to get caught.
GEORGE Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave ti?
JERRY We haven't spoken.
KRAMER Well, I'm not gonna need this anymore. I got Olive.
GEORGE Olive?
KRAMER Yeah. My lady friend down at Monks. You guys ought to see the way she works her nails across my back. Ohh! She's a maestro. The crisscross. The figure eight, strummin' the ol' banjo, and this wild, savage free-for-all where anything can happen.
GEORGE I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty minutes.
KRAMER Is that Elaine mannequin still there?
GEORGE Yeah. The last time I saw her, she was naked.
JERRY Yeah, and Poppie's got problems...
BOB Where is it? Where is it?
GEORGE Well, look at this. This doesn't belong here! Someone has made a terrible mistake.
BOB You bastard! You hid the suit.
GEORGE Hid? I have no idea how this suit got misplaced. Nevertheless, I do believe I shall purchase it.
BOB I hope you rot in that suit. I'm gonna get you for this. I don't know how, but I'm gonna get you. You are going to pay!
GEORGE Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short.
ELAINE So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin. You know, possible suspects.
JERRY Yeah, all right. Go ahead.
ELAINE There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost put his finger up my nose.
JERRY Hum... ok, what else you got?
ELAINE ok, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list.
JERRY Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it?
ELAINE Because you have an attitude.
JERRY_AND_ELAINE Oh!
JERRY Georgio! Nice duds!
GEORGE You're telling me. So, what do you think?
JERRY Did you hear something?
ELAINE Yeah, like a swoosh.
JERRY Yeah.
ELAINE It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound.
GEORGE I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street noise. This is no good! I got to meet these guys from MacKenzie for lunch in half an hour!
JERRY So what? What would they care?
GEORGE This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed.
JERRY So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make a noise?
GEORGE Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's gonna hire?
JERRY You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts.
KRAMER Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before.
JERRY Audrey?
KRAMER Yep. Sat down, had herself a piece of pie.
JERRY Was it apple?
KRAMER What else?
JERRY This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel!
STRANGER Do I know you?
ELAINE Hmm... No you don't.
STRANGER Yeah! You were wearing a G-string and one of those bras with points.
ELAINE The mannequin!
JERRY Oh, I got to see this thing.
JERRY Boy, the resemblance is uncanny.
ELAINE You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in your window!
SALESWOMAN It's our store and our mannequin, we can do whatever we want with it.
ELAINE No! You take down that mannequin right now, or I'm pressing charges. Yes, this is my attorney.
SALESWOMAN Yeah? What law am I breaking?
JERRY Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney,
ELAINE Uh-huh
JERRY The Charlie Macarthy hearings.
ELAINE Uh-huh. Are you taking this down?
SALESWOMAN I'm getting the manager.
ELAINE Jerry get the car.
JERRY What are you doing?
ELAINE Just get the car!
JERRY Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this.
JERRY I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint gum. I'm dropping you off at work, right?
ELAINE Where are you going?
JERRY Poppie's
MACKENZIE Thanks for meeting me down here George. My office is out of control, phones ringing, people running in and out. Did you hear something?
GEORGE No, I didn't hear anything.
MACKENZIE Huh, that's strange. It's quieter here. We can concentrate without people wooshing around... That sound again. Sure you didn't hear anything?
GEORGE No, can't say as I did.
MACKENZIE Kind of like a... rustling.
GEORGE Could be the leaves...
AUDREY That's right. Poppie's on 77th. Ok we'll see you at 8:00. Bye-bye.
JERRY Hello.
AUDREY What are you doing here?
JERRY So how was the pie?
AUDREY What pie?
JERRY The apple pie you had today at Monks
AUDREY I'm very busy here.
JERRY Pretty good, wasn'it? I told you you should've tasted it.
AUDREY You better not let Poppie see you here.
HEALTH_INSPECTOR All right, I'm looking for someone named Poppie.
AUDREY Uh, who are you?
HEALTH_INSPECTOR Board of health, we've had several complaints.
JERRY Oh, about the... uh
HEALTH_INSPECTOR Are you Poppie?
POPPIE I'm Poppie.
HEALTH_INSPECTOR I think you'd better come with me.
POPPIE What's the problem?
AUDREY What do they want from Poppie?
JERRY Well, Poppie's a little sloppy.
MACKENZIE You taught I'd care about your pants wooshing?
GEORGE I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted.
MACKENZIE No, no, no. He got fired because he wasn't a team player. That's something we don't joke about at MacKenzie. You'll find we're team here George. We don't tolerate dissent. If you want to go your own way, you're in the wrong place.
GEORGE No problem there. Conformity is an obsession with me.
WAITER Chocolate cream pie. Compliments of the house.
MACKENZIE Oh! Hope you saved room for dessert.
WAITER The chef said that he made it special for you.
GEORGE Oh...
MACKENZIE Mmm.. Best pie I've ever tasted. Take a bite George. Well, take a bite. It's delicious. I insist.
BUSINESSMAN If you're one of us, you'll take a bite.
JERRY So you didn't get the job.
GEORGE No. But I was the only one at the table that didn't get violently ill.
JERRY Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have to say something.
KRAMER What am I supposed to say?
JERRY Tell her you lost your itch.
GEORGE What happened to your itch?
KRAMER I lost it two days ago. I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt her feelings.
JERRY Well you should tell her.
KRAMER I'll let her down easy. All right. Well, hi Olive. No, no. No more of that. There's something I have to tell you.
OLIVE What?
KRAMER Uh, well, there's someone else.
OLIVE Someone else?
KRAMER Yeah, yeah, yeah...
OLIVE Who is she?
KRAMER Her.
OLIVE her?
KRAMER Yeah, there she is. That's my gal.
OLIVE You're a liar. I've seen her in here before. She's not your girlfriend.
KRAMER Now Olive, look, I'm sorry.
OLIVE Why is she wearing her underwear?
KRAMER Well, it's a style. Jerry give me the keys. Well, I guess we're gonna go for a drive now. She really loves that.
GEORGE Did you ever solve the riddle of the pie?
JERRY No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie away for a long long time.
ELAINE You guys are not gonna believe this. I just got a letter from a friend of mine in Chicago who's shopping, and she said she saw a mannequin that looked just like me. What if there're more. Where are they coming from?
RICKY'S_BOSS Ricky, we've been getting a tremendous response to your TR-6 mannequin.
RICKY TR-6? I prefer to think of her as... Elaine.
ELAINE Uh, excuse me.
GLADYS Be with you in a minute. No, you shoulda come last night, it was fun.
ELAINE Uhm, I just have a question.
GLADYS I know, the margaritas in that place are so strong.
ELAINE Helloo? I'd like to buy these hirachis.
GLADYS So? What else is goin' on?
ELAINE Hey!
GLADYS Listen, I'll call you back. Yes? What can I do for you?
ELAINE Nothing. You, just lost a customer.
VALERIE Ready to go? I don't wanna miss the previews.
JERRY Me neither. I love the previews. In fact I enjoy being in the theatre cut up. Last week after a preview, I yelled out 'Must miss'.
VALERIE I think that I was in that theatre. That, that was really funny.
JERRY Yeah, it got a good laugh. Let me just check my messages before we go.
GEORGE So you're on the speed dial?
JERRY After two dates!
GEORGE What number?
JERRY Seven.
GEORGE Wha! You know, it's a pain to change that. You gotta lift up that plastic thing with a pen.
KRAMER Uh, hey buddy.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER It all right if I keep these here for a while? I'm having a New Year's Eve party.
JERRY You're gonna keep these here for eight months?!
KRAMER No, Jerry. New Year's Eve nineteen ninety-nine. The millennium. I told you about that.
JERRY Kramer, you're gonna leave these chairs here for two and a half years?!
KRAMER You're not gonna see 'em. I got a case of party poppers I'm gonna keep in front of 'em.
GEORGE Hey, so get this. I get a call this morning from one of the Mets front office guys. They wanna take me out to lunch.
JERRY What for?
GEORGE I'm on a winning ball club, Jerry. They probably wanna pick my brains.
JERRY Really, why d'you think they're taking you out to lunch?
GEORGE I have no idea.
ELAINE Alright, I have had it with those Mayans.
JERRY I don't mind the Mayans.
ELAINE You know that store, Putumayo? I was trying to buy these hirachis, right, and the saleswoman just completely ignored me.
KRAMER What, we talking hirachis? I know a great store for hirachis.
ELAINE No, no, not Putumayo.
KRAMER No, no. Cinqo de Mayo. Yeah, Marcellino, he turned me on to it, and he's one sixty-fourth Mayan.
GEORGE You know, I'm starting to get a little nervous about this lunch.
ELAINE What'd you have?
KRAMER Yeah, I'm gonna keep these here too, huh? They'll be alright.
JERRY Kramer, these balloons aren't gonna stay filled till New Year's!
KRAMER Well, those aren't for New Year's. Those are my everyday balloons.
MINKLER George, we'll be blunt. The Mets need somebody to head up scouting, and we think that someone might be you.
GEORGE Head of scouting?
MOONEY Interested?
GEORGE I'm still here.
MINKLER Now, unfortunately, league rules prevent us from making you an offer while you're still under contract.
MOONEY You understand what we're talking about?
GEORGE So you're talking...
MINKLER No, no.
MOONEY We're not talking. We're just, talking.
GEORGE So, you need me to get fired.
MINKLER We didn't say that.
MOONEY We couldn't say that, because even if we did...
MINKLER ...we couldn't say that we said it.
MOONEY You see what we're saying?
GEORGE You are still paying for this lunch?
MINKLER We didn't say that.
JERRY Hi. Sorry I'm late. There's a lotta chairs and balloons in my apartment. How 'bout I make it up to you with dinner?
VALERIE Someplace nice this time?
JERRY Yeah, I'm sorry about that Mongolian barbecue last night. I'd heard good things.
VALERIE I don't know, got a two in Zagat's.
JERRY Lemme just check my messages. Maybe a nicer girl called.
VOICE Hello?
JERRY Hello? Who's this?
VOICE Jane. What number did you dial?
JERRY Seven?
ELAINE Hey! See these? Cinqo de Mayo! Sales commission, bye-bye-o!
GEORGE Meet the Mets...
GEORGE ...meet the Mets. Come on in and greet the Mets.
JERRY Good meeting?
GEORGE There was no meeting. But it was quite a meeting. You are looking at the next director of Mets scouting. The only thing is, I have to get fired from the Yankees first.
JERRY You can do that.
GEORGE Of course. But I really wanna leave my mark this time, you know, uh. I wanna walk away from the Yankees with people saying 'Wow! Now that guy got canned!'
JERRY So you want to go out in a final blaze of incompetence?
GEORGE Ehh. Remember that summer at Dairy Queen where I cooled my feet in the soft-serve machine?
KRAMER You think people will still be using napkins in the year two-thousand? Or is this mouth-vacuum thing for real?
JERRY So, George...
GEORGE Yeah.
JERRY I had like a so-so date with Valerie, now I'm number nine on the speed-dial.
GEORGE So?
JERRY So? I used to be seven. I dropped two spots.
GEORGE What, she's ranking you?
JERRY Yeah, this speed-dial's like a relationship barometer.
GEORGE What is a barometer exactly?
KRAMER It's pronounced thermometer.
KRAMER You know, in the year two-thousand, we'll all be on speed-dial. You'll just have to think of a person, they'll be talking to you. It'll be like, wup getting a call here.
KRAMER Hey, it's Newman. Hey, how you doing, Newman?
KRAMER Oh, you wanna talk to Jerry?
VALERIE Oh, flowers. You didn't have to do that. I mean, the dinner, and the play, and the hansom cab ride.
JERRY Well, I just wanted to... You forgot the gift certificate to Barnes and Noble.
VALERIE Oh.
JERRY ...you know, make a good impression.
VALERIE I'm gonna go put these in some water.
JERRY I like the way you think.
JERRY Oh my God! Number one!! Seinfeld, you magnificent bastard!
GEORGE Sorry I'm late, but look what I found in the Yankee Hall of Pride display case.
WILHELM Isn't that Babe Ruth's uniform?
GEORGE Is it?
GEORGE Huh, strawberries, anyone? Ah, that's good. Ooh, juicy this time of year.
GEORGE Gotta get the good ones.
GEORGE Oh, that's bad. That's bad.
KRAMER So Jerry, my millennium party's really coming together. Will people be able to breathe underwater in the year two-thousand?
JERRY Some of us.
KRAMER I don't wanna exclude anybody.
JERRY Hola.
ELAINE Shove it!
JERRY What is all this?
ELAINE I got all this junk at Cinqo de Mayo, because I was trying to show Putumayo how much business they'd lost. I mean, I been dancing and strutting in front of their store for two days.
JERRY Ah, no wonder we're getting so much rain.
KRAMER Elaine, I'm having a millennium party, so save the date.
ELAINE Hey, you know what? Newman sent me an invitation already, to his party.
KRAMER Newman?
ELAINE Yeah.
KRAMER Come celebrate the millennium, with Newmanniun. Newman!
JERRY Hi Valerie.
JERRY You're not Valerie.
MRS_HAMILTON I'm her step-mother. Drive.
MRS_HAMILTON It's taken me thirteen years to climb up to the top of that speed-dial, and I don't intend to lose my spot to you.
JERRY But, I never...
MRS_HAMILTON You just stay away from that phone.
GEORGE You wanted to see me, sir?
STEINBRENNER I heard about what happened at the meeting this morning...
GEORGE Oh, yes. I already packed up my desk, sir. I can be outta here in an hour.
STEINBRENNER ...and I have to tell you, it's exactly what this organisation needed.
STEINBRENNER We wanna look to the future, we gotta tear down the past. Babe Ruth was nothing more than a fat old man, with little-girl legs. And here's something I just found out recently. He wasn't really a sultan. Ah, what d'you make of that? Hey, check this out. Lou Gehrig's pants. Not a bad fit. Hey, you don't think that nerve disease of his was contagious, do you? Uh, I better take 'em off. I'm too important to this team. Big Stein can't be flopping and twitching.
STEINBRENNER Hey, how 'bout some lunch. What're you going for?
JERRY You know uh, Valerie, I uh, couldn't help but notice that I'm on your speed-dial.
VALERIE You deserve it.
JERRY But I can't help thinking that maybe there's someone in your life who deserves it more. Someone you've known, you know, more than a week.
VALERIE My stepmother got to you, didn't she?
JERRY What? No.
VALERIE Uuh, I can't believe she did this again. That's it! She's off the speed-dial completely!
JERRY Yikes!
KRAMER Well, I just got your invitation to the Newmanniun party.
NEWMAN You just got it? Damn, the mail is slow.
KRAMER You knew I was having a millennium party, but you just had to throw yours on the same day!
NEWMAN I have done nothing unethical.
KRAMER Yeah, well you're gonna have to cancel it, because I've told everybody about my party.
NEWMAN Cancel! Think again, longshanks! I started planning this in nineteen seventy-eight. I put a deposit down on that revolving restaurant that overlooks Times Square, and I booked Christopher Cross.
KRAMER Well, what am I gonna do? I got over two hundred folding chairs, and quite a bit of ice.
NEWMAN What kind?
KRAMER Cubed.
NEWMAN That's good stuff, and you can never have too much ice. Alright, I'll tell you what I'll do. You can co-host the party with me, under one condition. No Jerry. Jerry is not invited.
KRAMER I gotta invite Jerry. He's my buddy.
NEWMAN That he may be. But he's outta my life, starting in the year two-thousand. For me, the next millennium must be, Jerry-free!
JERRY How could they not fire you?
GEORGE Never thought I'd fail at failing.
JERRY Aw, come on there now.
GEORGE Feel like I can't do anything wrong.
JERRY Nonsense. You do everything wrong.
GEORGE Everything?
JERRY Everything.
GEORGE You really think so?
JERRY Absolutely. I have no confidence in you.
GEORGE Alright. I guess I just have to pick myself up, dust myself off, and throw myself right back down again!
JERRY That's the spirit. You suck!
GEORGE I know.
ELAINE No, no, no no, listen to me. I work in fashion. Together, we can drive Putumayo outta business and make Cinqo de Mayo numero uno... de Mayo.
GLADYS Do you need some help with something?
ELAINE You? What're you doing here?
GLADYS I own this store.
ELAINE No you don't. You own Putumayo. Unless you own both stores.
GLADYS I'm Gladys Mayo.
ELAINE Ah, this really sticks in my craw.
JERRY Well, Mrs Hamilton, it's certainly nice that you and Valerie patched things up, so we could all get together like this. Where is Valerie?
MRS_HAMILTON I'm sure she'll be along. Have some wine, Jerome.
JERRY Okay.
MRS_HAMILTON You know Jerome, I can understand what Valerie sees in you. So attractive, so strong, so comedic.
JERRY Uh, good.
MRS_HAMILTON Jerome, I have a deliciously naughty idea.
JERRY What?
MRS_HAMILTON Why don't I put you on my speed-dial?
JERRY I don't know, Mrs Hamilton. That doesn't sound...
MRS_HAMILTON Don't be such a child, Jerome. How's number three sound?
JERRY Valerie's not coming over, is she?
MRS_HAMILTON Seven, four...
JERRY No...
MRS_HAMILTON Two...
JERRY Stop, stop. This isn't right. What about Valerie?
MRS_HAMILTON I won't tell if you don't.
JERRY Wuhh...
KRAMER Jerry... Newman... Two-thousand...
KRAMER Newmanniun!!
KRAMER Jerry?
KOREN Alright, Yankees, two. Orioles, nothing. Wait a minute! A short stocky bald man is streaking across the field.
JERRY Oh my God, George!
KOREN Check that. He's not streaking. He's wearing a flesh-tone body-stocking. Apparently, he's a bit bashful, and oddly, no-one seems upset.
JERRY Kramer, look, it's George.
KOREN Everyone loves him.
KRAMER Yeah, yeah, I know. Listen, Jerry, I can't let you come to my New Year's party.
JERRY Fine.
KRAMER I mean, it's killing me! Newman's got the jump on the invites, and will crush me if I try to go it alone!
JERRY No problem.
KRAMER You're right. I won't do it without you. I feel so ashamed I even thought of it, huh.
KRAMER Elaine, you can't go to Newman's Newmanniun.
ELAINE Okay.
KRAMER No, no, no. You gotta spend New Year's nineteen ninety-nine with me and Jerry.
ELAINE Fine.
KRAMER Oh come on!!
ELAINE Alright.
KRAMER Yesss! Alright, so it's you, it's me, and it's Jerry, huh. Yeah, now things are starting to snowball, huh. I'll tell Newman I don't need him. So, I'll uh, see you two in the twenty-first century.
ELAINE Okay. Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute. Do you still have that pricing-gun?
KRAMER Yeah.
ELAINE Okay, I need you to help me put Putumayo outta business.
KRAMER Can do.
JERRY What're you doing with a pricing-gun?
ELAINE That place is about to have the sale of the century. Nothing over ninety-nine cents.
JERRY Still a rip-off.
JERRY Hello?
VALERIE Jerry, I was just at my stepmom's house, and I saw that you were on her speed-dial.
JERRY Uh, well, she uh, probably just wanted to be able to keep tabs on you.
JERRY Hold on a second.
JERRY Hello?
MRS_HAMILTON Hi Jerome.
JERRY Oh, Mrs Hamilton, this is a very bad time. I've got Valerie on the other line. Just a second.
JERRY Hello?
VALERIE That's her on the other line, isn't it?
JERRY Well...
VALERIE Tell her I don't want you on her speed-dial.
JERRY Hang on.
JERRY She knows about the speed-dial. Mrs Hamilton, you gotta get me off this thing.
MRS_HAMILTON I won't, until she puts me back on hers.
JERRY Hang on.
JERRY She wants to be back on yours.
VALERIE Fine. But only if you're off hers.
JERRY Hang on.
JERRY Fine, if I'm off yours.
VALERIE No, still me.
JERRY Sorry. Hang on.
JERRY Fine, if I'm off yours.
MRS_HAMILTON I won't do it. It's my speed-dial, and I don't trust her.
JERRY Please, Mrs Hamilton, this is very awkward for me.
MRS_HAMILTON Alright. I'll hide you in one of the emergency buttons.
JERRY Great, bye.
JERRY She said she'll do it.
VALERIE Great.
JERRY Hang on.
JERRY Hello?
GEORGE Jerry. I can't get fired.
FAN Hey, body-suit man. 's up?
FAN Hey, body-suit man.
KRAMER Hi, I'm H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy American industrialist uh, looking to open a silver mine in the mountains of Peru and uh, before I invest millions in a lucrative mine, I, I'd like to go a little native. Uh, Get the feel of their condiments, of their unmentionables, you know, the real uh, gritty-gritty.
GLADYS Well, lemme show you what we have.
KRAMER Well uh, I think I can just browse around on my own.
KRAMER Hmm, Macchu Picchu. Are these free?
GLADYS Yeah.
KRAMER Hmm-mmm.
GLADYS Some of those are women's clothes.
KRAMER Oh, not a problem.
GEORGE Attention Steinbrenner and front-office morons! Your triumphs mean nothing. You all stink. You can sit on it, and rotate! This is George Costanza. I fear no reprisal. Extension five-one-seven-oh.
KRAMER L'Occupado.
ELAINE Come on, what is taking you so long?
KRAMER Elaine, I broke the price-gun, so I had to move to plan B.
ELAINE Plan B? There is no plan B.
KRAMER I took these out of every single garment in the store.
ELAINE What?!
KRAMER They're dessicates. See, they absorb moisture. These clothes won't last five years without 'em.
ELAINE That's not gonna do anything.
KRAMER Patience.
ELAINE Alright. Forget it!
KRAMER What?
ELAINE You have screwed me again, Pennypacker!
GLADYS Ladies, care for some chips?
KRAMER Well, I don't mind if I do.
KRAMER Well, I've uh, I've changed my mind. I think I'm going to build a rollercoaster instead.
STEINBRENNER I heard what you did in the parking lot, big boy, and it is in-excuse-a-bull. You personally insulted me, my staff... I cannot believe that you, body-suit man, could perpetrate such a disloyalty. Breaks my heart to say it... Oh, who am I kidding? I love it. You're fi...
WILHELM Wait, wait, Mr Steinbrenner. George doesn't deserve any of the blame for what happened in the parking lot today, sir. If there's anyone to blame here, it's me.
STEINBRENNER What're you talking about, Wilhelm. You popping pills? You got the crazies again?
WILHELM No, no. No, no, sir. I ordered George to drive around insulting people today. Because I'm tired of all your macho head games.
GEORGE He's lying, sir! I'm tired of all your macho head games!
STEINBRENNER Macho head games?
WILHELM He's just being loyal to me, sir.
STEINBRENNER Wilhelm, you're fired. I owe you an apology, body-suit man. Streak on. Now, if you gentlemen'll excuse me, I'm not going to the game today, I'm gonna go outside and scalp some tickets. Owner's box, that's gotta bring in forty bucks, no problem.
GEORGE Mr Wilhelm, what was that?!
WILHELM I wanted to get fired. George, you are looking at the new head scout of the New York Mets.
WILHELM Meet the Mets, meet the Mets. Come right out and greet the Mets.
KRAMER I don't know what Elaine is so upset about. I mean, without dessicates, those clothes'll be noticeably musty in five years.
JERRY She never sees the big picture.
JERRY Hello, Newman!
NEWMAN Hello Jerry. What did you say to Elaine? I just got her cancellation in the mail.
KRAMER Oh, well I guess she found some place better to go.
NEWMAN Well, it's her mistake. Because she is going to miss the party of a lifetime.
KRAMER Well, maybe so, but come midnight, when she's looking for someone warm and cuddly to kiss, I guess you'll be caught between the moon and New York City.
NEWMAN Alright. Come back to my party, please.
KRAMER Jerry too, of course.
NEWMAN You don't wanna do your... act, or anything, do you?
JERRY No.
NEWMAN Alright then, I guess I can accept a little Jerry, if it gets me a lot of Elaine.
KRAMER Deal?
NEWMAN To the Newmanniun!
KRAMER To the Kramennium.
JERRY By the way Newman, I'm just curious. When you booked the hotel, did you book it for the millennium New Year?
NEWMAN As a matter of fact, I did.
JERRY Oh, that's interesting, because as everyone knows, since there was no year zero, the millennium doesn't begin until the year two-thousand and one. Which would make your party, one year late, and thus, quite lame.
JERRY Aww!
MRS_HAMILTON I don't feel well at all. I feel all dried-out inside.
VALERIE I'll call for help.
JERRY Hello?
VALERIE Who's this?
JERRY It's Jerry. Who's this?
VALERIE Uh, it's Valerie.
JERRY Oh, hi Valerie. What's up?
VALERIE I'll tell you what's up. My stepmother is violently ill, so I hit the button for poison control and I get you!
JERRY Wow, poison control? That's even higher than number one!
JERRY Hello?
GEORGE I loved her Jerry, I loved her.
JERRY No, you didn't.

GEORGE Ah, ...A beautiful successful intelligent woman's in love with me and I throw it all away. uh oh boy. Now I'll spend the rest of my life living alone.

JERRY You walk around with no underwear?
GEORGE Yeah, what do you do when you run out of laundry?
JERRY I do a wash.
GEORGE Who am I going to meet who is better than her? No one, Jerry. No one's better than her.
JERRY When you were with her you said you couldn't stand her.
GEORGE I loved her!
JERRY You said goin up the steps of her apartment was like being taken to a cell.
GEORGE I would give anything to be going up those stairs again.
GEORGE I gotta call her. Should I call her?
JERRY George, I don't know if that is such a good idea?
GEORGE Whyie?
JERRY You need some professional advice. Why don't you go see Elaine's friend? She's a therapist.

ELAINE See, she was clever. You know she put her picture on a card. I should do that. I never do anything like that.
KRAMER You want a picture like that on a Christmas card? I can do that for you. ...
GEORGE She kept such a nice clean apartment. She was so sanitary.
ELAINE No, no, I was just thinking out loud I don't want my picture on a card.

KRAMER Whooo, ... That's you! What is going on here? The gyp he laughs at me then he steals my idea. I could have been a millionaire. I could have been a fragrance millionaire, Jerry. ... They're not going to get away with this.
DANA Hello. George, come in. Come in I've heard an awful lot about you. Please sit down.
GEORGE Well hello. Um, ah, specifically the reason that I'm here, uh, I don't know uh what Elaine told you but uh I broke up with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago. Actually she broke up with me and uh, well, I was the cause of it and uh, I just wanted to find out from you ... What's with this thing?
DANA So uh, she broke up with you? ...
GEORGE Yeah, and, ... Why won't this go down?
DANA It's all right don't worry about it. So, why did she break up with you?
GEORGE What is with this damn zipper?
DANA It doesn't matter. You'll fix it later. Tell me about your girlfriend.
GEORGE It's stuck on a piece of cloth here. I can't get the cloth out.
DANA It doesn't matter, so ...
GEORGE This is a brand new jacket. Boy this really burns me up, ...
DANA George, George, look at me. Okay, forget about the zipper. ... What's your girlfriend's name?
GEORGE ... Susan.
DANA Okay, we're getting somewhere.
GEORGE Uh, ha ha, ... It's just so frustrating. It's a brand new jacket.
ELAINE Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work for that Church on Amsterdam.
JERRY Oh, volunteer work!. See that's what I like about the holiday season. That's the true spirit of Christmas. People being helped by people other than me. That makes me feel good inside. Look at what we have here. . A Christmas card from Laine. You didn't have to go to all that trouble.
ELAINE It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing.
JERRY I didn't even see the picture. How did it come out?
ELAINE Well, you know. It's a picture?
JERRY Oh yeah. Look at that. Looks good. Kramer did a good job.
ELAINE Yeah, well. How hard is it to take a picture?
JERRY ... um ...
ELAINE What?
JERRY Did you look at look at this picture carefully?
ELAINE Carefully?
JERRY Because I'm not sure and and and correct me if I'm wrong but I think I see ... a nipple.
ELAINE What?
JERRY Here. Take a look. What, what is that?
ELAINE Oh my God! That's my nipple.
JERRY That's what I thought.
ELAINE That's my nipple. My nipple's exposed. I sent this card to hundreds of people! My parents. My boss. Uh, Nana and Papa.
JERRY Didn't you look at the picture?
ELAINE Oh God I didn't notice. Oh, what am I going to do? You know your whole life you go through painstaking efforts to hide your nipple and then boom!, suddenly hundreds of people get their own personal shot of it.
KRAMER Hey!
ELAINE Have you seen the card?
KRAMER What card?
ELAINE This car.
KRAMER Yeah, yeah. Of course. I took it.
ELAINE Well did you notice anything unusual about it?
KRAMER No.
ELAINE Well come here and take a look.
KRAMER Yeah, so?
ELAINE So, what's that?
KRAMER That's a nipple.
ELAINE Right!!
KRAMER Ooo!
ELAINE Aw, great!? Didn't you see that?
KRAMER Aw, no, no I didn't notice it. no, uh,
ELAINE It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt.
JERRY Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it.
ELAINE No. I don't want him looking.
JERRY Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it.
ELAINE Oh my God. I sent one to the super in my building. My mailman. My ten year old little nephew. Sister Mary Catherine. Father Chelios. Oh my God Fred! I sent one to Fred.
NEWMAN Okay. What is it?
JERRY Take a look at this card. Tell me if you notice anything unusual about it.
NEWMAN Your nipple's showing.
JERRY Okay. Thanks.
NEWMAN Anything else?
JERRY No.
NEWMAN All right. See you later.
JERRY What? So what? It's a nipple. A little round circular protuberance. What's the big deal? See everybody's got them. See I got them.
KRAMER I got them too.
JERRY Everybody's got them.
DANA You see it's kind of got a little piece of cloth that's slipped underneath and it's ...
GEORGE Pull it up a little bit.
DANA Uhg. Well you hold it. Wait, uh, Damn It! I can't move it. God, I've never seen a zipper so stubborn. damn it! I almost had it.
GEORGE Yeah, okey, wait wait. That will separate.
DANA No. Let me try...
GEORGE Take it right off the chest...
DANA Ugh, ..
GEORGE You're gonna rip it. You're gonna rip it.
DANA Yeah!! Ugh!!! Arg!!! ... I am afraid we're going to have to stop.
GEORGE Okay. Uh, my mother is is going to pay for the sessions. ... Oh,Elaine?
DANA Yeah.
JERRY No, No, No, No, Oh, No.
JERRY Well every day for the past four days she hasn't returned one call.
GEORGE Was it a scratch or a pick?
JERRY It was a scratch.
GEORGE Hey. It's me.
JERRY Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and a scratch?
JERRY Yeah?
ELAINE It's me.
JERRY Come on up.
GEORGE Was there any nostril penetration?
JERRY There may have been some incidental penetration. But from her angle she was in no position to make the call.
GEORGE So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay, so then what?
JERRY Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick?
GEORGE I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit.
JERRY Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue going out with her?
GEORGE No. That's disgusting!
ELAINE You cannot believe what I'm going through. That card is plastered all over the office. Everybody is calling me, Nip! ... Yeah. That's my new nickname at the office. Nip! These guys keep asking me out for drinks. Not only that, Fred, you know the guy I told you about? He hasn't called me in three days. ... Oh please!
GEORGE Hey. How come I didn't get a Christmas card? Everybody else got one. Jerry got one, Kramer got one. I thought we were good friends. I don't get a Christmas card. I don't get it.
ELAINE You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? All right here. Here's your Christmas card.
KRAMER Got any Double Crunch?
JERRY yeah. I think I do.
KRAMER What's that perfume?
ELAINE What, Ocean.
KRAMER That's mine. That's my smell. Jerry you've got to get that model to get me an appointment with Calvin Klein.
JERRY I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me in a pick at a light.
KRAMER I thought you said it was a scratch.
JERRY But that's not what she thinks.
GEORGE Why don't you call her agency. Maybe she's been out of town and she didn't get the calls.
JERRY All right. I'll call the agency. Hello. Yes, I'm trying to get in touch with Tia Van Camp. Do you know if she's been in town? She's been in town. Oh really. well thank you very much. She has been in town. She's at Calvin Klein's right now.
KRAMER Let's go.
GEORGE It'll be different this time.
SUSAN I need someone a little more stable.
GEORGE I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off, you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds? Costanza!
SUSAN People don't change.
GEORGE I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there and I'm loving it.
SUSAN I'm not a soft boiled egg.
GEORGE And I am not a piece of toast.
SUSAN I just don't think we have anything in common.
GEORGE That's okay. That's good. You think Louie Pasteur and his wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the cows, you know with the milk, examining the milk, delving into milk, consummed with milk. Pasteurization, Homogenization, She was in the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand.
SUSAN Why were there so many cockroaches?
GEORGE Because. There was a lot of cake lying around the house. Just sitting there going with all the excess milk from all the experiments
SUSAN And they got along?
GEORGE Yes! Yes. You know. She didn't know about Pasteurization. He didn't know anout Fumigation. But they made it work!
KRAMER I want to talk to Calvin.
SECRETARY You can't go in there.
KRAMER Let me talk to Calvin.
TIA Kramer?
KRAMER Yeah, uh.
CALVIN_KLEIN Who are you?
KRAMER I'm here to talk about the ocean.
CALVIN_KLEIN Oh, yes kramer. I uh, think I know something about this. Will you excuse us Tia?
KRAMER Now I don't want any trouble Calvin.
CALVIN_KLEIN Neither do I.
JERRY Hello there you are.
TIA What are you doing here?
JERRY Well, I had to talk to you - I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.
TIA Well, I've been busy.
JERRY Because I - I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me
TIA I'd rather not talk about this..
JERRY But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.
TIA I know what I saw.
JERRY But there - but there was no pick! I - I did not pick! There ws no piick!
TIA I gotta go.
JERRY No! No pick!
KRAMER All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies..
KLEIN Interesting face..
KRAMER Yeah.. And, um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know, he - he laughed at me.
KLEIN You're very lithe, aren't you? Very graceful.
KRAMER Well, yeah.
KLEIN Sit down, eh? You're very lean, but muscular..
KRAMER You know, I try to take care of myself. I - I watch what I eat. Ah, just recently I cut out fructose.
KLEIN You're spectacular.
KRAMER Oh?
ELAINE I told you, Fred - my friend's next door neighbor took it.
FRED Soo - what happened?!
ELAINE Well, I-I-I must a missed a button. I forgot to button it.
FRED I really don't see how you could miss a button like that.
ELAINE Oh, you've never missed a button?! Yeah?..
RECEPTIONIST Your sister, Gail.
ELAINE Oh, God - my nephew. Hi, Gail!.. Yu.. yu... Yes, Gail, I know how old he is.
COWORKER Hey, Nip, ya need that manuscript or can I take it home?
ELAINE Yeah, take it! Take it!.. An' stop calling me "Nip"! It was an accident! Well.. well.. it's gotta be somewhere. Look under his mattress.
WOMAN About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point? My.. he's sexual, athletic.. an' without a trace of self-consciousness!
KLEIN His buttocks are sublime!
MAN Of course, his pectorals could use a little work - I suppose we could get him into the weight room.
WOMAN No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.
MAN You've done it again, C.K.!
JERRY An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing, and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame and humiliation because of people like you.. Are we not human?! If we pick, do we not bleed?! I am not an animal!
ELAINE I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you, I wish now that I had! Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!
GEORGE So the minute I started up the steps to her apartment I knew I made a terrible mistake. Going back with her. So we're in her apartment she goes into the bathroom. I'm cursing myself; now how do I get out of this? Then it hits me like a bolt of lightening. The pick.
JERRY The pick?
ELAINE The pick?
GEORGE She comes out of the bathroom, I'm in up to my wrist. You should have seen the look on her face.
JERRY I think I've seen that look.
KRAMER I've got the magazine. The underwear ad came out.
JERRY Boy, they really worked on your pectorals.
GEORGE Your buttocks are spectacular.
ELAINE Oh my!
KRAMER What?
ELAINE I'm not sure but... I think I see your...
TUTTLE Well George we here at Sanalac like to think of ourselves as a fairly progressive company. We have a small but prestigious group of clients.
GEORGE Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious.
TUTTLE That's funny George. You're very quick. I feel like I, like I don't have to explain every little thing to you. You understand everything immediately.
GEORGE I enjoy understanding.
TUTTLE I want you to have this job. Of course...
SECRETARY Mr. Zimmer is on line 2.
TUTTLE Thanks. I've got to take this call. Listen, I'm really glad that you came in. At Monk's
GEORGE I want you to have this job. Of course...
JERRY Yeah?
GEORGE That's it.
JERRY What do you mean that's it?
GEORGE He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was the end of the interview.
JERRY "Of course" was the last thing he said?
GEORGE Maybe he was going to say "Of course I have to check with my associates."
ELAINE "I want you to have this job, of course the Board of Directors is under indictment and will be serving time."
JERRY "I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a prerequisite."
GEORGE All right.
ELAINE Why don't you go ahead and call him?
GEORGE Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately. That's what impressed him.
JERRY So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose the job.
GEORGE And if I don't call...
JERRY You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind of company is it?
GEORGE Rest stop supply. Kramer comes in and sits down.
KRAMER Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey.
JERRY Shower?
KRAMER Haircut.
JERRY Who'd you use? Gino?
KRAMER Oh course. I wouldn't let that other butcher cut my hair.
ELAINE What butcher?
KRAMER The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry uses.
JERRY Well I've been going with him for 12 years. I can't switch. I'd hurt his feelings.
ELAINE You never get good haircuts.
KRAMER You can get a good one today. It's Enzo's day off. Gino's there all by himself.
JERRY Really?
ELAINE Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one to look good for my bachelor auction.
KRAMER What bachelor auction?
ELAINE Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity.
KRAMER And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money to cure polio.
JERRY I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time.
KRAMER Polio?
ELAINE Will you go ahead? You need a haircut.
JERRY Okay.
KRAMER What are you all dressed up for?
GEORGE I had a job interview.
KRAMER Yeah. How'd it go?
GEORGE Good. Of course... At the barber shop
ENZO Oh Jerry.
JERRY Oh hi Enzo.
ENZO Oh, you've come for the haircut.
JERRY No, actually I was just...
ENZO It's my day off, but I take care of you anyway because you're my favorite customer. You've been with me for so long. You're so loyal.
JERRY Well I, if it's your day off I really...
ENZO Eh, what's the difference. It takes 10 minutes. Jerry, today I'm going to do something special for you.
JERRY Well I don't want to take too much off.
ENZO Hey who's your barber, eh? You tell the joke, I cut the hair.
MAN Gino, you've outdone yourself this time. This is the best haircut I've ever had. At Jerry's apartment. Jerry is sitting down on the couch with a really bad haircut. He is holding a mirror. Jerry and George are looking in disbelief at the haircut.
GEORGE He massacred you. You look like you're five years old.
JERRY What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps.
GEORGE You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this relationship.
JERRY I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd have to pass him every day when I go by.
GEORGE You gotta do it.
JERRY I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart. Kramer enters. He flinches when he sees the haircut.
KRAMER No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo.
JERRY He did the job. You told me he wasn't going to be there.
KRAMER So what?
JERRY I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
KRAMER His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying yourself. I'm not going to let you. If you don't call him I will.
JERRY No Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that.
KRAMER I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him, and we're going to get that haircut fixed up.
JERRY I don't want you to call him.
KRAMER All right, geez. You're crazy. Kramer leaves.
GEORGE So I still haven't heard about that job.
JERRY Yeah that's a tough one. What are you going to do about that?
GEORGE I have an idea.
JERRY Yeah?
GEORGE I show up.
JERRY What do you mean you show up?
GEORGE I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't have the job, by the time he comes back, I'm ensconced.
JERRY Hmm. Not bad.
GEORGE What's the worst thing that could happen?
JERRY Well, you'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out in shame with your tail between your legs.
GEORGE Yeah, so? At the office.
GEORGE Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Hi nice to see you. How are you. Good morning. Good morning.
SECRETARY How can I help you?
GEORGE The name's George Constanza. I'm starting work here today. I was wondering if you could tell me where my office is.
SECRETARY I wasn't aware that, uh, Mike, this is George Constanza. He's starting here today.
MIKE Welcome aboard.
GEORGE Thanks Mike. Nice to be aboard.
MIKE I wasn't aware that Mr. Tuttle was finished interviewing.
GEORGE Oh, well, he was probably just getting anxious to start his vacation.
SECRETARY He wants to know where his office is.
MIKE Oh, ah, let's see, we've got two. There's a big one down the hall there and a small one over here. You know I should ask Jack.
GEORGE Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough problems. I'll just take the small office.
MIKE Really?
GEORGE Yes. I like to feel cozy. I have a very small apartment. I like to feel tucked in, nestled in. Love to be nestled.
MIKE All right, it's 808 right down there. Meanwhile, I'll get you the Pensky file, you can start working on that.
GEORGE Yes, yes of course. The Pensky file. Ho ho, can't wait to sink my teeth into that. Wow that Pensky. Well we'll straighten him out. George walks into his office. He sets down his briefcase and coat and sits down. He quickly flips through the folder, then drops the folder on his desk with a big thud. George puts the folder in his briefcase. He picks up the briefcase and his coat and he walks out. At Monk's. Jerry is wearing a baseball cap.
JERRY So what did you do there all day?
GEORGE They gave me the Pensky file.
JERRY So it's a nice place to work?
GEORGE You know I'm enjoying it very much. I think my coworkers are really taking to me. flashback
GEORGE I feel like a family. In fact, yesterday was Grace's birthday. She's such a sweet woman so, we had a little party, with cake and champagne. I made a toast. end flashback
JERRY What about your boss? The guys you interviewed you?
GEORGE He'll be back on Monday. Elaine enters and sits down.
JERRY Hi.
ELAINE Hi. How come you're wearing a hat?
JERRY I got a haircut.
ELAINE Oh yeah? Can I see it?
JERRY Oh there's nothing to see.
ELAINE Come on. Let me see it.
JERRY Forget it.
ELAINE Come on.
JERRY All right. Jerry takes off his baseball cap. Elaine bursts out laughing. George starts laughing. Jerry rolls his eyes in the air. Elaine and George are still laughing. George pounds his fist on the table.
ELAINE I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
JERRY Well I'll tell you this, you can forget about me going to that bachelor auction.
ELAINE What? No Jerry, you have to go.
GEORGE You know Elaine, I'd do it but I'm working that day.
ELAINE Yeah, too bad. At the barber shop. Gino is giving Kramer a shave.
KRAMER It the worst haircut Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it.
GINO Sure, I fix it. But you gotta make sure you no tell anybody. He's a little crazy. I don't know what he'd do if he found out I touch Jerry's hair. So I love the Edward Scissorhands. That's the best movie I've ever seen.
ENZO Oh ah, again with the Edward Scissorhands. How can you have hand like scissors, huh? Show me one person who's got hand like scissors.
GINO Hey, it's a beautiful dream. I'd love to be this man.
ENZO Did you ever think about what you're going to do on the toilet? What are you going to do on the toilet?
KRAMER I'd like to have shoehorn hands. At Monk's.
KRAMER Okay listen to me. I talked to Gino, he's going to fix the haircut.
ELAINE Oh great, then you can go to the bachelor auction.
JERRY Yeah, but how am I...
KRAMER No buts. His apartment tonight, Eight o'clock.
ELAINE Can he fix it?
KRAMER I don't know. At Gino's apartment.
GINO Boy, you've got a beautiful head of hair.
JERRY Thank you.
GINO I bet uncle Enzo, he tell you that all the time.
JERRY Well actually Enzo hasn't said that to me in a while.
GINO I don't think uncle Enzo realize what a lucky barber he is.
JERRY That's nice of you to say. The buzzer buzzes.
GINO Just a second. Yes.
ENZO It's your uncle Enzo.
GINO It's Uncle Enzo. Go in there. I'll clean up. "The Barber of Seville" music is playing. Gino picks up the chair and puts it into the closet. He picks up a broom and sweeps some hair into the next room. knock, knock, knock Gino opens the door.
GINO Uncle Enzo, what are you doing here?
ENZO I've come to apologize.
GINO Apologize?
ENZO Yes. I rented the move Edward Scissorhands. That Johnny Depp, he make me cry.
GINO He make me cry too. You want something to drink?
ENZO Hey, what's all of this?
GINO Nothing. It's just hair.
ENZO You do haircut in the apartment?
GINO No. Pizza man was here. Maybe some fall off. He's going bald.
ENZO It looks very familiar. At Jerry's apartment.
JERRY In the one minute he worked on me I could tell he was really good.
KRAMER Yeah. Slow, gentle, attentive. I told you he could do it.
JERRY Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor.
KRAMER Yeah, so?
JERRY I think he knew.
KRAMER No. He doesn't know.
JERRY Who do you know? He knows my hair.
KRAMER Listen you're just imagining things. He doesn't know a thing. Now come on. Pull yourself together.
JERRY Okay, okay. Elaine enters.
ELAINE What happened? It looks the same.
JERRY He didn't get to finish it. His uncle came in. We almost got caught.
ELAINE Jerry, the auction is in a few hours.
JERRY Take the K-man.
ELAINE You can still go.
KRAMER What are you kidding? Look at him. He's grotesque.
ELAINE You think?
KRAMER Do I think? He's repugnant. Elaine fiddles with the hair, trying to make it not look so bad. It doesn't work.
ELAINE What would you wear?
KRAMER Whatever it takes. At the barber shop.
ENZO See, now Newman is a good customer.
NEWMAN Once I find a barber I stick with him. I almost went to barber school. I always felt I had a talent for it.
ENZO Oh, not everyone like Newman, so loyal.
NEWMAN Yeah, just the way that I was raised. I'm special.
ENZO You know I don't mind if somebody's funny, but I no like the funny business.
GINO I'm going to go out for a little bit. I'll be right back.
ENZO Take your time. You happy with the haircut?
NEWMAN It's okay. A little crooked.
ENZO How'd you like to have free haircut for six months.
NEWMAN What's the catch?
ENZO You're going to get me a sample of Jerry's hair.
NEWMAN Hmm, that job sounds like it might be worth a year's free haircuts. And a comb. At George's office. George is "playing the drums" on his desk. He is tapping his desk with pencils. buzz
SECRETARY Mr. Costanza, Mr. Pensky is here to see you.
GEORGE Mr. Pensky? Of the Pensky file? Pensky enters.
PENSKY Costanza? Arthur Pensky.
GEORGE Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your file. I was transferring the contents of the file into this flexible accordion-style folder.
PENSKY Where's Tuttle?
GEORGE He's on vacation.
PENSKY He was on vacation the last time I dropped by. Give me my file. Looks like you put a lot of work into this.
GEORGE Well you know in college they used to call me the little bulldog.
PENSKY Hey, you are Pensky material. Would you ever consider coming to work directly for me?
GEORGE Really?
PENSKY You are aware... buzz
SECRETARY Mr. Castanza?
GEORGE Not now Florice.
SECRETARY I thought Mr. Pensky should know they're towing his car.
PENSKY Damn this city. Pensky leaves.
GEORGE I am aware. I am aware. At Jerry's apartment.
GINO He knows. He knows about us.
JERRY How do you know?
GINO Because I know. He's crazy. All morning, he looking at the hair. He staring at the hair. knock knock knock
JERRY Who is it?
NEWMAN It's Newman.
GINO He was in the shop with Enzo. He can't see me here.
JERRY All right, go in the bedroom. Open the window. You can go out the fire escape. Jerry opens the door.
JERRY What do you want?
NEWMAN Can I use your bathroom?
JERRY What's wrong with yours?
NEWMAN My toilet's clogged.
JERRY You can't unclog it?
NEWMAN No.
JERRY Did you ask Kramer?
NEWMAN He's out.
JERRY Number one?
NEWMAN Yes, yes. Can I go? Cause I gotta go very badly.
JERRY All right. Flush twice. He goes in the bathroom.
NEWMAN No. Jackpot. I don't believe this. There's no hair in this thing. I've never seen a person that didn't have at least one hair in a brush. Unbelievable, nothing. Ahh.
JERRY You all right?
NEWMAN Yeah, yeah.
JERRY All right, I'll see you later.
NEWMAN What are you doing?
JERRY I'm watching Edward Scissorhands.
NEWMAN Oh, can I watch a little? It's my favorite movie.
JERRY Yeah all right. Newman follows behind Jerry closely as Jerry goes to the kitchen. Newman puts the scissors close up to Jerry's hair. Jerry turns around. Newman hides the scissors.
JERRY You want something to drink?
NEWMAN No. Newman tries again as Jerry goes to his couch. Newman follows behind Jerry closely. Newman puts the scissors close up to Jerry's hair. Jerry turns around. Newman hides the scissors. Jerry looks at Newman confused.
JERRY If you want to watch, sit down. You're making me nervous. I tell you this Scissorhands is a hell of a barber. Newman reaches behind Jerry and get a snip of hair.
NEWMAN Gotta go. Oh gee, I dropped a nickel Newman leaves laughing. Jerry looks confused. At the barber shop.
ENZO Did you get it? Oh you done good Newman.
NEWMAN It was a cinch. Where are you going?
ENZO Io volgio vandetta. At the auction house.
ELAINE Nine hundred. Do I hear a thousand? Ladies, he is a Harvard graduate.
WOMAN A thousand.
ELAINE A thousand. Okay, a thousand once, a thousand twice, a thousand three times, sold to the lucky lady in the third row. Congratulations, thank you so much. Kramer peeks out the curtain and comes out and walks around on stage.
ELAINE Okay next bachelor is number, um 124 on your program. He's uh, he's a high school graduate.
KRAMER Equivalent.
ELAINE Oh, uh equivalency. A high school equivalency program graduate. He's uh, self-employed. He's... I don't know, six foot three, 190 pounds, he likes, uh... fruit, and he just got uh, a haircut. Kramer steps from the stage onto a table. The table tips over and Kramer falls off.
ELAINE Oh, Kramer. Okay uh, why don't we start the bidding. Do I hear, uh, five bucks? At Jerry's apartment.
JERRY I don't get this Scissorhands. What, is he supposed to be like a super hero, like Green Lantern or somebody? What's with this guy? Just asking. knock, knock, knock
JERRY Who is it?
ENZO Enzo Manginero. "Barber of Seville" music playing.
JERRY Oh my god, he knows. Go. One second.
ENZO It was you that was in Gino's apartment the other night.
JERRY No I wasn't there.
ENZO Don't lie. I know it was you. I get a sample of your hair. I match them up.
JERRY Sample? Newman. Uh, I was there but I was just dropping off a book.
GINO Don't Jerry.
ENZO So, it's true.
GINO Yes it's true.
ENZO I'm going to kill the both of you. Enzo notices "Edward Scissorhands" playing on the TV and becomes calm. At the office. George is at his desk sleeping with a newspaper draped over him. Tuttle walks in. He bangs on the door. George wakes up.
GEORGE TUTTLE, you're back.
TUTTLE George, I'm surprised to see you here.
GEORGE You are?
TUTTLE I though you would have taken the large office.
GEORGE Oh. Really.
TUTTLE I guess I didn't make that clear when I hired you. So where's that Pensky file? Let's see what you've been up to all week. What have you been doing all week?
GEORGE Well you missed a lovely little party that we had for Grace.
TUTTLE You haven't done anything with this.
GEORGE Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office.
TUTTLE I'm beginning to wonder if you understand anything.
GEORGE You are aware that Pensky is interested in me.
TUTTLE You're not Pensky material.
GEORGE Well, we'll just see about that. Ta-ta, Tut-tle. At Jerry's apartment. Gino and Enzo are watching "Edward Scissorhands" on TV. They are both sobbing. At the barber shop. "Barber of Seville" music is playing. Jerry looks in the barber shop window and sees Newman giving a guy a haircut. He enters. Newman looks at him scared. Jerry picks up an electric razor and walks toward Newman. Newman is very frightened.
PENSKY Gee George, I'm sorry I gave you the wrong impression. What is was going to say was, now you are aware that our Board of Directors has been indicted, myself included, and we're prohibited from doing business until the investigation is completed. So obviously, we would have no use for you.
GEORGE Obviously. buzz
PENSKY Yes.
SECRETARY Excuse me, but Mr. Costanza's car is being towed. George waves his hand and the final note of "Barber of Seville" plays.
JERRY I hear you're going out with David Putty.
ELAINE Yeah. What, is it a problem?
JERRY Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine.
ELAINE Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It has been a few years.
JERRY Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is obviously impossible.
ELAINE Oh, god.
JERRY The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic.
ELAINE Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their big, muscular arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is.
JERRY All right.
GEORGE Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping todays the day.
ESTELLE So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly you're a shell-fish connoisseur.
GEORGE You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is just torture.
ESTELLE So, I'm getting an eye job.
GEORGE An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job.
ESTELLE Georgie, I'm a divorcee.
GEORGE No, you're not a divorcee. You're just separated. You're---you're a separatee.
ESTELLE Well, I'm out there, George.
GEORGE No, you're not out there.
ESTELLE I am, too!
GEORGE You're not out there! You can't be, because I am out there. And if I see you out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence!
ESTELLE Well, anyway, the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive me home because I'll be all drugged up.
GEORGE Tuesday? I can't do it Tuesday. Steinbrenner needs me to run---
ESTELLE This is the only time the doctor has.
GEORGE Kramer, hey, hey!
KRAMER Hi, little buddy.
GEORGE Come on over and sit down.
KRAMER Hey, listen, I gotta go somewhere.
GEORGE No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun...
KRAMER All right, I'm sitting down. How are you?
ESTELLE So, Kramer. I'm getting an eye job.
KRAMER Oh, yeah, good for you. Hey, you have to look your best. You're out there now.
GEORGE She's not out there!
KRAMER So, who is your doctor?
ESTELLE Uh, Bakersoll.
KRAMER . He's good. He's very good. He worked on this kid from Guatemala with no nose. Turned him into Ricardo Montalban.
GEORGE Hey, Kramer, what are you doing Tuesday?
KRAMER Tuesday? Uh...
GEORGE Why doesn't he pick you up after the operation. He's got the car with the bench seats that you like.
ESTELLE Oh, I don't care.
KRAMER Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to the motor vehicle bureau and get my new plates.
GEORGE Well, giddy-up!
KRAMER Yeah, I'm here to pick up my new plates. My name is Kramer. Cosmo Kramer.
CLERK Kramer.... All right...
KRAMER All righty...
CLERK Sign right here, please.
KRAMER Okay. . Thanks. Assman? Oh, no, these don't belong to me. I'm not the Assman. I think there's been a mistake.
CLERK What's your name again?
KRAMER Cosmo Kramer.
CLERK Cosmo Kramer. You are the Assman.
KRAMER No! I'm not the Assman.
CLERK Well, as far as the state of New York is concerned, you are.
DAVID How do you feel?
ELAINE Fine.
DAVID Something the matter?
ELAINE No.
DAVID Then what is it?
ELAINE No, nothing.
JERRY Hi.
ELAINE I was with David Putty last night.
JERRY Yeah, so.
ELAINE He did the move.
JERRY What move?
ELAINE You know...the move.
JERRY Wait a second. My move? .
JERRY David Putty used my move?
ELAINE Yes, yes.
JERRY Are you sure?
ELAINE Jerry! There is no confusing that move with any other move.
JERRY I can't believe it. He stole my move.
ELAINE What else did you tell him. The two of you must have had quite a little chat!
JERRY Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex talk. It's a high-testosterone area.
ELAINE Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?
JERRY Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it.
ELAINE Well, wait---wait a second.
JERRY What?
ELAINE Isn't that a little...rash?
JERRY No! He stole my move!
ELAINE Yeah, but...I like the move.
JERRY Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.
ELAINE Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a pinch at the end instead of the swirl!
JERRY Oh, yeah. The pinch. I've done the pinch. That's not new. Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves now. His whole repertoire could be lifted.
ELAINE You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic.
JERRY I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.
JERRY ...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine.
GEORGE You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell me? I need a move. You know I have no moves, Jerry. Gimme a bite.
JERRY Can I just get it opened first?
GEORGE I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo.
JERRY All right, all right. Here. .
GEORGE Oh, that's good. That's very good.
JERRY You feel better?
GEORGE Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need something. This woman I'm dating, it's like she's doing her nails during love-making.
JERRY Nancy Klopper?
GEORGE Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here. Give me a moan. Something. I'd settle for a belch, for god's sake. All right, come on, let's have it.
JERRY All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure, before---
GEORGE Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault.
JERRY It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a conscientious way. This is not some parlor trick to be used---
GEORGE You're gonna tell me...or not.
JERRY All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need a headboard.
GEORGE I got a headboard.
JERRY Is it padded?
GEORGE No.
JERRY Good. How tall is she?
GEORGE Five-foot four. Why?
JERRY You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights. Otherwise, you could really hurt your neck.
GEORGE I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this.
JERRY George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again. Jerry and George have just walked in, still conversing on the same subject
JERRY Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. I feel the swirl is a great capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous.
GEORGE Is it a clockwise swirl?
JERRY I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone. .
KRAMER Here you go, buddy. .
JERRY What is it?
KRAMER Fusilli Jerry! It's made from Fusilli pasta. See the microphone?
JERRY When did you do this?
KRAMER In my spare time. . You know, I'm working on one of you, George. I'm using ravioli. See, the hard part is to find a pasta that captures the individual.
JERRY Oh... Why Fusilli?
KRAMER Because you're silly. Get it? Yeah...
JERRY Well, thank you very much.
GEORGE So, did you get your new plates?
KRAMER Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up. Somebody got mine and I got their vanity plates.
GEORGE What do they say?
KRAMER Assman.
JERRY Assman?
KRAMER Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman!
JERRY Who would order a license plate that says "Assman"?
GEORGE Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's.
JERRY It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be just some guy with a big ass.
KRAMER Yeah, or it could be a proctologist.
JERRY Yeah. Proctologist.
GEORGE Come on! No doctor would put that on his car.
KRAMER Have you ever met a proctologist? Well, they usually have a very good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away. Plant yourself there, because you will hear the funniest stories you've ever heard. See, no one wants to admit to them that they stuck something up there. Never! It's always an accident. Every proctologist story ends in
THE_SAME_WAY "It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one."
KRAMER Oh! There's my phone.
GEORGE So, where you gonna stick this
JERRY I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.
JERRY Hey, David.
DAVID Oh, hi, Jerry.
JERRY Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move.
DAVID What move?
JERRY What move? My move. The one I told you about. You used it on Elaine.
DAVID You're move? What, are you kidding? I was doing that before I knew you. All you told me about was the ending.
JERRY The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing. You had nothing.
DAVID Oh, that ending was so obvious. I would have figured it out anyway. I didn't need you to tell me that stupid twist.
JERRY Swirl.
DAVID Whatever. I don't even do it.
JERRY Oh, yeah, I know. You do the pinch.
DAVID Yeah, that's right.
JERRY You can't come up with your own stuff , so you steal other peoples? You're nothing but a hack.
DAVID Are you through, 'cuz, uh, I gotta get back to work.
JERRY Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out of town...okay. But not in the city.
DAVID All right, how about the next time your car breaks down, you take that out of town.
JERRY Fine.
DAVID Good!
NANCY Ow, George! What are you doing?
GEORGE Uh...you know, uh...pleasuring you.
NANCY Well, stop it!
GEORGE You don't like the move?
NANCY No. I don't.
GEORGE You're kidding.
NANCY No, I'm not. It feels like aliens poking at my body.
GEORGE Sorry. I'll just go back to my usual routine.
ELAINE Oh, god! Oh, god, Dave! Oh, yes! Yes!
DAVID No, I'm sorry.
ELAINE What?!!
DAVID I can't do the move.
ELAINE What?
DAVID Oh, he's ruined it for me.
ELAINE Oh, oh, come on, please?
DAVID No, he called me a hack. I'm just not into doing it anymore.
ELAINE Oh, so---so that's it?
DAVID I'll come up with some new stuff.
KRAMER "Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think I have what you're looking for." .
DR._BAKERSOLL I must caution you about one thing. You can't cry for at least ten day. You can ruin the operation.
ESTELLE Oh, okay.
DR._BAKERSOLL Now, is someone coming to pick you up?
ESTELLE Yes, my son's friend should be here any minute.
SECURITY_GUARD Can I help you?
KRAMER Ah, yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer. Proctology.
SECURITY_GUARD Oh, oh, okay. Sure...
KRAMER Thanks. Have a good day.
KRAMER I just can't get over how fantastic you look.
ESTELLE Oh, really?
KRAMER Oh, yeah. This takes twenty years off.
ESTELLE And it was all done by laser. I don't even need bandages. .
ESTELLE Did he say "Assman"?
KRAMER Oh, yeah.
ESTELLE Oh my goodness. "Hey, the Assman's in town!"
KRAMER You got that straight!
ESTELLE Boy. I never dreamed it could make such a difference.
JERRY You must have done something wrong. You probably screwed up the order. Did you close with the swirl?
GEORGE Supposed to close with the swirl?
JERRY Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression there. I told you to write it down.
GEORGE Yeah, yeah, should've written it down.
JERRY Yeah?
BUZZER Elaine.
JERRY C'mon up. You know what? Do me a favor. Don't even do the move anymore. You're gonna give it a bad name.
JERRY Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred dollars?!! That's the estimate on my car?!! No, don't even do anything. I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye.
GEORGE What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's what it is. He's not gonna cheat you.
JERRY Except that it's not Putty.
GEORGE What happened to Putty?
JERRY Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other place. I think they might be trying to screw me.
GEORGE Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think? That's what they do. They can make up anything. Nobody knows. "By the way, you need a new Johnson rod in there." "Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, well, you better put one of those on."
JERRY Hey, Elaine.
ELAINE Yeah, yeah, hello.
JERRY Is it something I said?
ELAINE Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move anymore.
JERRY Really?
ELAINE Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this thing.
JERRY What is it?
ELAINE Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's like? It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes nowhere.
JERRY Huh.
ELAINE I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up a lot of my time. And I...will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me, when a perfectly good move is just sitting in the barn doing nothing!
GEORGE Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle involved in any way?
ELAINE Yes. As a matter of fact, there is.
GEORGE I think that's mine.
ELAINE I'm not surprised.
JERRY Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're gonna see him?
ELAINE Why?
JERRY You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is trying to screw me.
ELAINE An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?
JERRY Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out.
ELAINE What? What is this?
JERRY That's, uh, Fusilli Jerry.
ELAINE Fusilli Jerry?
JERRY Yeah. Kramer made it.
GEORGE All right, listen, I'll see you guys later.
JERRY Hey, Assman!
KRAMER Hey, well, this is Sally.
SALLY Hello.
JERRY Hi.
ELAINE Hi.
KRAMER Shall we go?
SALLY Okay.
ESTELLE You can't face the fact that I'm improving myself.
FRANK You're not the only one improving yourself. I worked out with a dumbbell yesterday. I feel vigorous.
ESTELLE Just take your mail and go home. I have things to do.
FRANK I got things to do, too.
ESTELLE Don't upset me! I can't cry!
FRANK Getting an eye job like some Manhattanite, huh?
ESTELLE Well, it's already working. Kramer made a pass at me.
FRANK Kramer made a pass at you? You're crazy.
ESTELLE I'm not crazy. He stopped short and made a grab.
FRANK He stopped short? That's my move. I'm gonna kill him!
ELAINE Hey, let me ask you a question.
DAVID Sure.
ELAINE What do you charge for blown shocks?
DAVID What?
ELAINE Two, three hundred?
DAVID I don't know. Maybe five hundred.
ELAINE Ah.
ELAINE What about a bad gasket?
DAVID Bad gasket?
ELAINE Yeah. Like a terrible gasket.
DAVID What is all this?
ELAINE Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do.
DAVID What kind of car is it?
ELAINE Oh...any kind of---of a Swedish car.
DAVID All together, that could run about sixteen hundred.
ELAINE Oh.
ELAINE Is that with the parts and labor?
DAVID Uh-huh.
ELAINE Hmm.
ELAINE Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle....
NANCY Wow. That was...great. I mean...wow.
GEORGE It just came to me.
NANCY I---I've never in my life have---have I---. What was that?
GEORGE You mean in the end?
NANCY Uh-huh.
GEORGE A counter-clockwise swirl.
NANCY What's that?
GEORGE What?
NANCY On---on your hand? Let me see what's on your hand.
GEORGE Nothing. I don't know...just a little dirt.
NANCY Give me that. I wanna see what's on your hand.
NANCY Number one. Take her leg.... Oh, my god! Crib notes? You've got crib notes?!!
GEORGE It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all.
NANCY Oh, my god, you're sick.
GEORGE You know, it's not the S.A.T.s!
FRANK Assman? I'll get him, Assman!
JERRY Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? Ooh, they are ripping me off.
ELAINE So what are you going to do?
JERRY Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth this.
ELAINE Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore?
JERRY Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.
JERRY Hi, Mr. Constanza. What's uh...?
FRANK Where's your friend Kramer?
JERRY I don't know. Why?
FRANK Because I'm looking for him. That's why. He stopped short.
JERRY What do you mean?
FRANK In a car, with my wife. He stopped short. You think I don't know what that's about? That's my old move! I used it on Estelle forty years ago! I told everybody about it! Everybody knows! Hmmph! I stopped short.
JERRY Really, stopping short. That's a good move.
FRANK You're not kidding it's a good move!
KRAMER Hey.
JERRY Hey.
KRAMER Hey, Frank.
FRANK Don't Frank me! I know what you did. How dare you stop short with my wife!
KRAMER C'mon, Frank, relax. I don't even know what you're talking about.
FRANK You think I don't know, Assman?!! To think I almost split the profits on the Manssierre with you.
KRAMER Bro.
FRANK Manssierre!
KRAMER Bro!
FRANK Manssierre! You...!
FRANK Aah!!!
JERRY Oh, my god!
JERRY If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it.
ELAINE Me either.
GEORGE They say this guy's the best.
JERRY He had to use cork-screw pasta.
KRAMER Jerry. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.
KRAMER The name on the boat. Look at it.
JERRY Assman!
KRAMER Yeah , he's the Assman! Jerry, he's the Assman!
DOCTOR Which one is the son?
GEORGE I am.
DOCTOR Ah. I'm Doctor Cooperman. I just want you to know that this won't take long. And he's going to be fine.
KRAMER Yeah, excuse me, uh... You didn't by any chance recently get the wrong license plates?
DR._COOPERMAN Yes. I'm still waiting for the motor vehicle bureau to straighten it out.
KRAMER So...you're the Assman.
FRANK It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one.
ESTELLE Where have you been?!! You were supposed to fix the stove! I've been waiting for hours!
FRANK I fell on some Fusilli.
ESTELLE Fusilli?
FRANK You know, the corkscrew pasta. It was a Fusilli Jerry. It got stuck in me. Had to go to the proctologist.
ESTELLE The proctologist? Are you okay?
FRANK Yeah.
ESTELLE Oh, I was so worried.
GEORGE Ma, don't cry!
ESTELLE Oh, I can't help it!
GEORGE Ma, your eyes!
ESTELLE Oh!
